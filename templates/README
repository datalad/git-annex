These are template files for the git-annex webapp. They use the
Shakespearean template library, which is documented here:
http://www.yesodweb.com/book/shakespearean-templates

Note that for most of the templates, it will use files ending in
.hamlet, .julius, and .cassius if they exist. So if you need to add CSS,
or javascript, you can create the missing template files.
