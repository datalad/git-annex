      Good news: Your repository has successfully been repaired!
    <p>
      This problem could have had a variety of causes. If your computer #
      lost power, or the drive containing this repository #
      was disconnected, it would explain this type of problem.
    <p>
      On the other hand, it's possible that you have a hardware problem.
    <p>
      Remember: Lots of copies keep stuff safe! The more repositories you #
      have, the less likely you are to lose data no matter what goes wrong.
