      Adding an Amazon Glacier repository
    <p>
      <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/glacier/">Amazon Glacier</a> is an #
      offline cloud storage provider. It takes several hours for requested #
      files to be retrieved from Glacier, making it mostly suitable for #
      backups and long-term data archival. #
    <p>
      <span .glyphicon .glyphicon-warning-sign>
      \ By default, only files you place in #
      "archive" directories will be archived in Amazon Glacier.
    <p>
      <span .glyphicon .glyphicon-warning-sign>
      \ You will be charged by Amazon for data #
      uploaded to Glacier, as well as data downloaded from Glacier, and a #
      monthly fee for data storage. #
