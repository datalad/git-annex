        Old versions of files and deleted files can be preserved inside #
        this repository.
    <p>
      This might be useful, if you ever need to access those old or deleted #
      files. But they'll also use up disk space. There are three ways to deal #
      with this.
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          Set up a backup or archive repository, on a removable drive #
          or in the cloud, and the unused files will be moved to it, freeing #
          up space.
          <br>
          <a .btn .btn-default href="@{AddRepositoryR}">
            <span .glyphicon .glyphicon-plus>
            \ Add a new repository
      <li>
        <p>
          Or, you can let unused files expire after a period of time.
          <form method="post" .form-inline enctype=#{enctype}>
            ^{form}
      <li>
        <p>
          Finally, you can clean up all unused files manually at any time.
          <br>
          <a .btn .btn-default href="@{CleanupUnusedR}">
            <span .glyphicon .glyphicon-trash>
            \ Clean up unused files now
