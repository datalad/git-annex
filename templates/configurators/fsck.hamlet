      Consistency checks
    <p>
      Checking the contents of a repository periodically will ensure that #
      your data is in good shape. Any problems that are detected will #
      be automatically fixed.
    <p>
      Running the consistency check involves reading all the files in the #
      repository, which can take a long time if it's large. Running just a #
      little at a time will eventually check the whole repository.
    $if (not (null scheduledchecks))
      <p>
        Currently scheduled checks:
        $forall c <- scheduledchecks
          ^{showFsckForm False c}
          <div style="margin-left: 5em">
            ^{showFsckStatus c}
    <p>
      $if null (recommendedchecks)
        Add a check:
        ^{showFsckForm True (defaultFsck Nothing)}
      $else
        <span .glyphicon .glyphicon-warning-sign>
        \ Some repositories are not yet checked. #
        Please consider adding these checks:
        $forall c <- recommendedchecks
          ^{showFsckForm True c}
