      Pairing in progress ..

        You do not need to leave this page open; pairing will finish #
        automatically.
    $else
      <p>
        Now you should either go tell the owner of the computer you want to pair #
        with the secret phrase you selected ("#{secret}"), or go enter it into #
        the computer you want to pair with.
      <p>
        You do not need to leave this page open; pairing will finish automatically #
        as soon as the secret phrase is entered into the other computer.
      <p>
        If you're not seeing a pair request on the other computer, try moving #
        it to the same switch or wireless network as this one.
