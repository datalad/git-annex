      Pairing with a local computer
    <p>
      $if start
        Pair with a computer on your local network (or VPN), and the #
        two git annex repositories will be combined into one, with changes #
        kept in sync between them.
      $else
        Pairing with #{username}@#{hostname} will combine your two git annex #
        repositories into one, allowing you to share files.
    <p>
      $if start
        For security, enter a secret phrase. To verify that you're pairing #
        with the right computer, its git-annex webapp will then prompt for the #
        same secret phrase. That's all this secret phrase will be used for.
      $else
        $if sameusername
          For security, you need to enter the same secret phrase that was #
          entered on #{hostname} when the pairing was started.
        $else
          For security, a secret phrase has been selected, which you need #
          to enter here to finish the pairing. If you don't know the #
          phrase, go ask #{username} ...

            A good secret phrase is reasonably long. You'll only #
            type it a few times. Only letters and numbers matter; #
            punctuation and white space is ignored.
          <p>
            A quotation is one good choice, something like: #
            "#{sampleQuote}"
        $else
          Only letters and numbers matter; punctuation and spaces are #
          ignored.
