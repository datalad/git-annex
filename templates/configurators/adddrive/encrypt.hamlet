      Encrypt this drive?
    <p>
      Encrypting the repository stored on the removable drive at #
      <tt>#{mountPoint drive}</tt> #
      will prevent the data stored in it from being exposed if the drive #
      falls into the wrong hands. However, encryption #
      will also prevent you from sharing the repository with friends, or #
      easily accessing its contents on another computer.
