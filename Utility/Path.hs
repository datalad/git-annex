{- Simplifies a path, removing any "." component, collapsing "dir/..",

 -
 - On Windows, preserves whichever style of path separator might be used in
 - the input FilePaths. This is done because some programs in Windows
 - demand a particular path separator -- and which one actually varies!
 -
 - This does not guarantee that two paths that refer to the same location,
 - and are both relative to the same location (or both absolute) will
 - yeild the same result. Run both through normalise from System.FilePath
 - to ensure that.

{- Given an original list of paths, and an expanded list derived from it,

 - When the original path is a directory, any items in the expanded list
 - that are contained in that directory will appear in its segment.
 -
 - The order of the original list of paths is attempted to be preserved in
 - the order of the returned segments. However, doing so has a O^NM
 - growth factor. So, if the original list has more than 100 paths on it,
 - we stop preserving ordering at that point. Presumably a user passing
