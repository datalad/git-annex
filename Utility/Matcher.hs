{- A generic matcher.
 -
 - Can be used to check if a user-supplied condition,
 - like "foo and ( bar or not baz )" matches. The condition must already
 - be tokenized, and can contain arbitrary operations.
 -
 - If operations are not separated by and/or, they are defaulted to being
 - anded together, so "foo bar baz" all must match.
 -
 - Is forgiving about misplaced closing parens, so "foo and (bar or baz"
 - will be handled, as will "foo and ( bar or baz ) )"
