I don't usually like any decals on my stuff.. but I've never come across this before and it looks interesting. I'm really tempted..

However, I wouldn't be able to do it without having some nice way of dealing with tolerance stacking. The overlapping stickers (bottom-right) on the photo above would drive me mad! :)

I went ahead and [raised an issue](https://github.com/terinjokes/StickerConstructorSpec/issues/18) in case they want to deal with this in the specification by having a(some?) guide specification(s) too.
