# NAME

git-annex readpresentkey - read records of where key is present

# SYNOPSIS

git annex readpresentkey `key uuid`

# DESCRIPTION

This plumbing-level command reads git-annex's records about whether
the specified key's content is present in the remote with the specified
uuid.
  
It exits 0 if the key is recorded to be present and 1 if not.

Note that this does not do an active check to verify if the key
is present. To do such a check, use [[git-annex-checkpresentkey]](1)
