# NAME

git-annex post-receive - run by git post-receive hook

# SYNOPSIS

git annex post-receive

# DESCRIPTION

This is meant to be called from git's post-receive hook. `git annex init`
automatically creates a post-receive hook using this.

When a repository is configured with receive.denyCurrentBranch=updateInstead,
pushes to the repository update its work tree. However, that does not work
for repositories that use direct mode or have an adjusted branch checked
out. The hook updates the work tree when run in such a repository,
the same as running `git-annex merge` would.
