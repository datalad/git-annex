[annextimelog](https://gitlab.com/nobodyinperson/annextimelog) (`atl`) is a cli time tracker and logbook made by [[users/nobodyinperson]]. It uses git-annex to store and sync data. `atl` has a loosely similar usage to [timewarrior](https://timewarrior.net/) but improves on many of its pain points:

- tracking of simultaneous events
- conflict-free syncing
- more powerful tagging system
- more powerful search
- more output formats (JSON, hledger timeclock, ...)
- a more sophisticated event specification language

annextimelog is also an experiment how useable git-annex is as a backend for syncable application data storage. While first sounding silly, it works very well.
