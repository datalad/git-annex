I like the idea of `copy --from-anywhere --to=remote` and just 
use the lowest cost remote (when not in local repo). Like `git-annex get`
and `git-annex copy --to=here`.

Hmm, if there's a remote that is too expensive to want to use in such a
copy, it would be possible to use `-c remote.foo.annex-ignore=true`
to make it avoid using that remote. As can also be done in the case of
`git-annex get`, although that was not documented well.

I've implemented --from-anywhere..
