So that leaves only the question of what it should do when
content is present locally but not on the --from remote.

Another reason for the current behavior is to be symmetric with `git-annex
move --from foo --to bar`. It would be surprising, I think, if that
populated bar with files that are not present in foo, but are in the local
repository!

So I'm inclined to not change the documented behavior. If you want to
populate a remote with files that are either in the local repo or in a
--from remote, you can just run `git-annex copy` twice after all.

(Or there could be a new option like `git-annex copy --to bar --from foo --or-from-here`)
