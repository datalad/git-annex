That is intentional, because a git-lfs remote can have multiple urls that
can access it, and different users of the remote might want to use
different urls.

It's also documented to work that way, the same as the directory
special remote documents that you have to provide directory= each time it's
enabled.

But, now that git-annex supports sameas remotes, it would be possible to
have one special remote for each different url to a given git-lfs remote,
and have git-annex know they're the same repository. The user can then
enableremote whichever one they want.

See [[todo/git-lfs_special_remote_simpler_setup]] for where I hope this
will lead.

Closing this bug report as redundant with that todo item, and not actually a
bug since it is documented to behave the way it currently behaves.
