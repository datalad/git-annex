Implemented that. But..

As implemented, there's nothing to make the chunk size get stored in the
chunk log for a key, after it accesses its content using the configured
chunk size.

So, changing the chunk= of the remote can prevent accessing content that
was accessible before. Of course, avoiding that is why chunk sizes are
logged in the first place.

Seems like maybe fsck --from should fix the chunk log? I think
fsck would always need to be used, to fix up the location log, before any
other commands rely on the data being in the special remote, so it seems
fine to only fix the chunk log there.

But, also a bit unclear how fsck would find out when it needs to do this.
It only needs to when the remote's configured chunk size is not
listed in the chunk log. But that's also common after changing the chunk
size of a remote. So it would have to mess around with checking the
presence of chunk keys itself, which would be extra work and also ugly
to implement.

I'm leaving this todo^Wbug open for now due to this.
