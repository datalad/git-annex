Note that what you are trying to do will only work if the special remote
is not encrypted.

As well as your use case, which seems very unusual, I think one other use
case would be if a clone uploaded to the special remote, but never synced
out its git-annex branch before being lost, and fsck --from
remote is being run in another clone to reconstruct it. Currently it
won't try chunks as none are recorded.

Speculatively trying the current remote's chunk config would handle the
majority of cases, though wouldn't help if the other clone had adjusted the
special remote's chunk size too.

There's some overhead, but it can check it last, and not check it if
it's in the list of known chunks, so the overhead would only usually 
be paid if the content git-annex expected to be present had gone missing,
which I think is rare enough to not care about.

(Also, this can only be done when the size of the key is known, so not
eg addurl --relaxed keys.)
