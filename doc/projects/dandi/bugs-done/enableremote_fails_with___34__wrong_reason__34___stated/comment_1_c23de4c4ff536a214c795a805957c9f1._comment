I wonder if it even makes sense for git-annex-shell to replicate this git
security check, or would it be better for it to instruct git to trust the
repository, so it can be used on it?

git's CVE-2022-24765 involves a malicious creation of a .git repository
above the victim's cwd, with a .git/config that causes things like eg shell
prompts that run git to execute attacker-controlled commands.

git-annex-shell commands all take the directory that the repository is
in, and uses that repository. So it doesn't traverse above looking for
other .git directories.

And, `git clone` will happily clone a remote repsository that's owned 
by another user, including over ssh. And pull and push etc work with such a
remote. So git-annex-shell should too.

(For that matter, other git-annex-shell commands do work, it's only the
command that reads the git config that fails to work.)
