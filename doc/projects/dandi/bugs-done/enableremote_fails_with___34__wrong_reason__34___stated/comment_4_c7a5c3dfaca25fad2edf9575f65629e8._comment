Another related case is when git has been configured with
safe.bareRepository=explicit and the remote (either ssh or local)
is a bare repo. git-annex-shell will fail with the same misleading message,
and for a local repo, git-annex will also display the same misleading
message.

I think it also ought to override safe.bareRepository for such remotes,
because eg git pull works with such remotes. The point of 
safe.bareRepository=explicit is not to prevent using bare remotes, but to
prevent things like shell prompts to accidentially use bare repos that are
eg, committed by a malicious attacker to a git repository, to avoid using
git configs that allow running arbitrary code.
