Thank you Joey!  indeed most likely a \"too fancy\" of a file system.

On [https://www.beegfs.io/release/beegfs_6/Changelog.txt](https://www.beegfs.io/release/beegfs_6/Changelog.txt) I found 


```
== Changes in 6.11 (release date: 2017-05-26) ==

General Changes:

* client: Add option sysRenameEbusyAsXdev to return EXDEV instead of EBUSY if
  rename() is called on open files. (Tools like \"mv\" can handle EXDEV as return
  value.)
```

do you think EXDEV would be worked out Ok if that is the culprit? (meanwhile I will let the beegfs users know as well - may be they could try)
