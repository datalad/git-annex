       EBUSY  The rename fails because oldpath or new‐
              path  is  a  directory that is in use by
              some process (perhaps as current working
              directory,  or as root directory, or be‐
              cause it was open for reading) or is  in
              use  by the system (for example as mount
              point), while the system considers  this
              an  error.   (Note  that there is no re‐
              quirement to return EBUSY in such cases—
              there  is  nothing  wrong with doing the
              rename anyway—but it is allowed  to  re‐
              turn  EBUSY  if the system cannot other‐
              wise handle such situations.)

".git/annex/tmp/URL-s3--file&c%%%mnt%beegfs%yoh%tmp%.t%tmprepo193%myurl"
is not a directory, it is a file. So, rename seems to have no business failing
in this way. Probably the FS is buggy.
