I think it worked wonderfully

<details>
<summary>here is my script I have tried</summary> 

```shell
#!/bin/bash

export PS4='> '
set -x
set -eu
cd \"$(mktemp -d ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/dl-XXXXXXX)\"

mkdir d-in d-repo 
echo content >| d-in/file 

function dance() {
    git annex import master --from d-in
    # but we need to merge it
    git merge d-in/master
    ls -l
    grep -e . *
}

( 
cd d-repo 
git init
git annex init 
git annex initremote d-in type=directory directory=../d-in exporttree=yes importtree=yes encryption=none

ls -l ../d-in

for r in 1 2; do 
   echo \"Run $r\";  
   dance
done 

echo \"more\" >> ../d-in/file
echo \"new\" > ../d-in/newfile
dance

rm ../d-in/file
dance

)

```
</details>

and it seemed to do the right job!  I have not tried to add some `.gitattributes` into that branch it imports into to tell some files to go to git, but I hope it would just work, and if not -- I will come back!  feel welcome to close this issue.

Cheers
