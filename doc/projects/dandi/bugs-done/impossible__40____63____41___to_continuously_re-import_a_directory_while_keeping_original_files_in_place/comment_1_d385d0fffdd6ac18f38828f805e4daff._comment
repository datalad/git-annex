I think that you can accomplish what you want by making the directory
you're importing from be a directory special remote with exporttree=yes
importtree=yes and use the new `git annex import master --from remote`

If that does not do what you want, I'd prefer to look at making it be able
to do so. I hope to eventually remove the legacy git-annex import from
directory, since we have this new more general interface.
