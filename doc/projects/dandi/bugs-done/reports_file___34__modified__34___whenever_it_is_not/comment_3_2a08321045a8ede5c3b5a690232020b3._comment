the workaround you suggest elsewhere for \"cosmetic\" problem works here too

```
(dandisets) dandi@drogon:/mnt/backup/dandi/dandisets/000026$ git status
On branch draft
Your branch is up to date with 'github/draft'.

Changes not staged for commit:
  (use \"git add <file>...\" to update what will be committed)
  (use \"git restore <file>...\" to discard changes in working directory)
        modified:   .dandi/assets.json

no changes added to commit (use \"git add\" and/or \"git commit -a\")
(dandisets) dandi@drogon:/mnt/backup/dandi/dandisets/000026$ git update-index -q --refresh .dandi/assets.json
(dandisets) dandi@drogon:/mnt/backup/dandi/dandisets/000026$ git status
On branch draft
Your branch is up to date with 'github/draft'.

nothing to commit, working tree clean

```

but since we are relying on output from `status`, it is not just a \"cosmetic\" issue. IMHO if such `update-index` is needed, it should have been done by git-annex automagically somehow/sometime.
