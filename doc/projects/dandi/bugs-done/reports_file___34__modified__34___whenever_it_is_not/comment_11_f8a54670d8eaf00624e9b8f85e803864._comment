Yeah, a whole git-annex test run with stalldetection set would have found
this bug. Which seems a bit heavy-weight for the test suite to try as a
separate pass by default. But then again, stalldetection does significantly
change how git-annex operates since it has to fork off child processes that
it can kill when they stall.
