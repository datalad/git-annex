So you can reproduce this? I am pretty sure it's not as simple as a drop
followed by a get, so more information about reproducing it seems crucial.

I assume you are *not* seeing the "This is only a cosmetic problem affecting git status"
message?

I expect that running `git update-index --refresh .dandi/assets.json`  
will fix git status. Can you confirm?

The only way I know of that this can happen without the message is if a
drop or a get is still running, or gets interrupted. One of the last things
git-annex before exiting is restage all the unlocked files that it has
updated.

Short of that, it seems like it would have to be a bug that prevents
restagePointerFile from working. Which might not be a bug in git-annex,
if the problem involves git's handling of timestamps in the index, for
example. (Which is known to have some odd behaviors.)

(git-annex could be improved to do the
restaging later when interrupted and possibly after such a bug.
But there's no way to make it recover in `git status`, because
git doesn't run it in this situation.)
