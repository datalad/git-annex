`git-annex import` does not do any sanitization, and that could be
considered inconsistent, particularly when importing from a remote like S3.

A difference with that is, it creates a remote tracking branch for the
imported files. (That happens to avoid "../" path traversal because git
generally avoids it.) Maybe the real difference is, import from a special
remote is completely analagous to fetching from a git remote. So it feels
different to me than adding an url does. 

If I sync with a S3 bucket and it turns out it imported a escape sequence
file, well I could have looked at the bucket first, or imported and
reviewed the branch before merging it. And if I was syncing with a git
remote the same thing could happen. So it feels like I should have no
expectation git-annex would protect me. Whereis, if I add an url and the
web server uses an obscure-ish http header to surprise me with a similar
malicious filename, I had no way before hand to know that would happen, and
so it does feel like git-annex should protect me.

(Although if git did prevent that, git-annex should too, and I'd be
fine with git preventing that.)
