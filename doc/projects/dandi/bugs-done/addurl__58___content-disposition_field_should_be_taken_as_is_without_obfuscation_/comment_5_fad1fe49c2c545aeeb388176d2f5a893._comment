I agree that it may as well allow non-leading '-'. But, if you are relying
on getting the unsanitized filename generally, you should use
--preserve-filename

Web browsers do do some santization, particulary of '/'.
Chrome removes leading "." as well. Often files are downloaded
without the user confirming it. I suspect there is enough insecurity
in that area that someone could make a living injecting bitcoin miners into
dotfiles.
