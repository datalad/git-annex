Implemented git-annex addurl --preserve-filename, which will do what you
want.

Leaving this bug open because I only implemented it for web urls, not yet
for torrents and other special remotes that have their own url scheme.
The sanitization for those is currently done at a lower level than addurl,
and so that will take a bit more work to implement.

(importfeed does not, I think, need to implement this option, because
the filenames are based on information from the rss feed, and it's
perfectly fine to sanitize eg a podcast episode title to get a reasonable
filename.)
