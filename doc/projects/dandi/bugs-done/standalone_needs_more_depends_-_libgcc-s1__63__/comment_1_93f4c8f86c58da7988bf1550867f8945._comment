I'm a bit surprised git-annex is using `pthread_cancel`, since `strings`
does not show it contains that symbol. Perhaps one of the other pthread
symbols it uses ends up calling that.

It does seem though from the message that it's git-annex and not a program
it runs that is core dumping on this. Also I checked, and the rclone you 
installed is a statically linked binary so I would not expect it to use
`libgcc_s.so`. And  And git-annex-remote-rclone is a bash script, and bash
doesn't use pthreads.

(I do think that, in general, using the git-annex standalone tarball and
then trying to run additional programs besides git-annex inside it is not
going to always work well. Standalone interposes its own versions of libraries,
which may not work with the other programs. There is already a todo about that, 
[[todo/restore_original_environment_when_running_external_special_remotes_from_standalone_git-annex__63__]].)

I've added `libgcc_s.so.1` to the standalone build.
