It still seems easy to demonstrate that git does not ask for creds on 404:

	joey@darkstar:~> git clone http://google.com/this-url-does-not-exist
	Cloning into 'this-url-does-not-exist'...
	fatal: repository 'http://google.com/this-url-does-not-exist/' not found

So I need you to show me what makes you think that git does such a strange
thing, before I can take seriously a request to replicate that behavior in
git-annex. Because the only possible reason I would implement such an
insane thing is if git has lost its collective mind and so I needed to
follow into the abyss.

If the actual issue is that gogs has implemented support for git-annex,
but that it sends 404 when git-annex requests config from a
private repo, rather than 401, it seems to me the place to fix that is in
gogs.
