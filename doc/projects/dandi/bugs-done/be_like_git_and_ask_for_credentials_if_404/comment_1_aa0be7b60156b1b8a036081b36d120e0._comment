The git source code does not appear to behave
like that, see http.c `normalize_curl_result`, which reauths on 401, but 
not on 404. If you think git behaves like this, you need to show an example
where it clearly accesses an url that is 404 and goes on to authenticate.

Seems to me that these hosting sites may simply not be exposing foo.git/config
to http. Git does not request that file over http. Such a hosting site would
probably also not expose foo.git/annex/ over http, so git-annex would not be
able to use it anyway. To support git-annex, it would need to
expose both, and then git-annex's handling of 401 should work fine for
authentication.
