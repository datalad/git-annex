THANK YOU Joey.  That is indeed quite odd (\"security through obscurity\") behavior from github (note: github returns 401 even if that repo does not exist, so it is at least consistent in not revealing presence/absence of private repos at a url). Feel welcome to close this issue since I guess nothing should indeed be done on git-annex side, and ideally `gin` portal just returns 401 in such cases
