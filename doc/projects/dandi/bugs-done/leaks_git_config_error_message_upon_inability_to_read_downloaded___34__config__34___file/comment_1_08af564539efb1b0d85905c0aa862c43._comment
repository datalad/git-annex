I haven't tested, but I can see the situation where a specific repository URL could be handled by external special remote (such as datalad, downloaders of which do handle obscure setups such as this one without 403/404 but rather forwarding to login page) which would provide authenticated access to the URL.  Would annex even try that config URL via external special remotes?
