Is it reproducible with a particular url? Does it only happen with -J?

Version would also be good to know. There were recent relevant 
changes eg [[!commit 4f42292b13dc5a6664eeb19b5c9d48991eaef292]].

I've spent a while hunting for a code path where it fails without
displaying a warning, and have not found one. Since the code in addurl
is structured as return Nothing and hopefully display a warning
beforehand, rather than as throw an error, it's certianly possible that
happens.
