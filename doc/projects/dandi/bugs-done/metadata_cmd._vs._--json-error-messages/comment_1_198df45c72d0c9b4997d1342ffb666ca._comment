For consistency with other --batch, I've made it reply with a blank line
when the input is not an annexed file.

Do note that --json-error-messages cannot cram every possible kind of error
message into a json object. In particular, errors that occur at startup,
and not when acting on a particular file or key, do not fit into the json
schema.
