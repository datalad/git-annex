May be would be of help: here datalad-archives spits out TRANSFER-SUCCESSes really fast since it takes it little time to just copy a little file... so it feels to me that issue is in some race condition within git-annex.  If I add 100ms delay before returning TRANSFER-SUCCESS from the special remote - number of failures goes down to 0-2 instead of 5ish. With 200ms delay seems to get no failures whatsoever.
