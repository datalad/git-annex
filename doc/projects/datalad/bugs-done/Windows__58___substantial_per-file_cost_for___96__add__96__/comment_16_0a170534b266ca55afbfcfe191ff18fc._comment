`git add x` takes less than 0.1 seconds run on the github windows CI in a
git-annex repo.

      - name: profile
        run: |
          git init profile
          cd profile
          PATH=..:$PATH ../git-annex.exe init
          echo foo > x
          date
          PATH=..:$PATH git add x
          date

Output:

	ok
	(recording state in git...)
	Tue Sep 28 21:51:46 CUT 2021
	warning: LF will be replaced by CRLF in x.
	The file will have its original line endings in your working directory
	Tue Sep 28 21:51:46 CUT 2021

So, whatever made it slow for @mih is not a problem here, and I guess
not where @adina ran it either.
