Each `git add` has to run a new `git annex smudge`
process. `git commit` will often run it as well.
This is discussed in detail in
[[todo/git_smudge_clean_interface_suboptiomal]].

According to
<https://github.com/datalad/datalad/issues/5994#issuecomment-923744895>
git-annex 8.20201127 had the same performance that you are seeing
with the current version. So it cannot be any changes in the past year
that impacted git-annex performance.

But <https://github.com/datalad/datalad/issues/5317> seems like it would
have been using around the same version of git-annex, and the timing there
was much faster. Unfortunatly the issue does not say what version
of git-annex was used, but it seems likely it would have been around
8.20201127 since that was released 2 months prior.

So are the timings in those issues comparable, or is it an apples/oranges
comparison with different hardware or OS version?

And if the timings between those issues are not comparable, what exactly
is this new issue comparing with when it says the peformance has worsened?
