I noticed in the strace that smudge --clean ran git cat-file 2
more times than necessary. Also was able to avoid updating the git-annex
branch, which eliminates several calls to git (depending on the number of
remotes). On Linux, this made it 25% faster. Might be more on Windows.

Rest of the strace looks clean, nothing else stands out as unnecessary.
