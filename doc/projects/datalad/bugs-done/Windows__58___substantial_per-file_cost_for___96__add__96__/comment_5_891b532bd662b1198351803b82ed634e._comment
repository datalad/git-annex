Thank you for verifying this is not a recent speed reversion.

You could use `git -c filter.annex.clean= add smallfile`
to avoid the overhead of the smudge filter.
Using `git annex add --force-small` or `git annex add` with an
annex.largefiles config will also avoid it.

ghc 8.12 has a new IO manager for windows, which
I think is likely to be faster. (It avoids the win32 API.) I would
want to look at that before other windows-specific optimisations.
The windows build is still using lts-16.27 (ghc 8.8.3), there is not
yet an lts release with ghc 8.12.

I don't know if there are really any windows-specific optimisations to
be had in the smudge code other than such low-level stuff.
