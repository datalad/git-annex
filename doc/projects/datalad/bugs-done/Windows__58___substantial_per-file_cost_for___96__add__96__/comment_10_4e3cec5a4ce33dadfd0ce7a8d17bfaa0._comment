Since my profiling above shows windows is as fast as linux (though
probably on faster hardware), one thing I am wondering is if antivirus
could be slowing it down. I know AV on windows can slow down things like
writing to files, because it blocks closing the file until it finishes
scanning. Maybe the github windows CI does not run AV, but your windows
does, mih?
