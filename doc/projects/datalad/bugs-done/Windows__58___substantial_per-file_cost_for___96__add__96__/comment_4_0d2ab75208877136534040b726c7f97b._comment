> I'm still curious if there's an older version of git-annex that was faster (after it stopped using direct mode in v7). If I've understood correctly, you don't seem to be saying that there is.

Here is some data that seems to support this view.

I dug up another windows box on the higher performance end

- windows 11 (not 10!) build 10.0.22000
- intel 6-core xeon E-2136 @ 3.3ghz
- NVMe drive

All stats done with

- git 2.32.0.windows.2

I am reporting two values each, the first for git annex 8.20210715-g7334893d4 and the second for 7.20191107-g8ea269ef7 (the oldest windows build that I could find). Consequently, the first measurement is for a v8 repo, the second for a v7 repo (but no direct mode).

init

- git init: 0.1s / 0.1s
- git annex init: 3.2s / 3.2s

after creating a 3-byte text file:

- git add file: 1.0s / 0.9s
- git commit file -m msg: 1.8s / 1.8s

after creating two new 3-byte test files:

- git add .: 1.9s / 1.7s
- git commit -m msg: 0.9s / 0.9s

(NB: the `add` increase is caused by unique keys, adding a bunch of identical files is the same as adding one file)

after creating eight more 3-byte text files:

- git add .: 6.5s / 6.8s
- git commit -m msg: 0.9s / 0.9s

now adding a 280 MB binary file

- git add binfiile: 9.8s / 9.9s
- git commit -m msg: 1.2s / 1.2s

no changes

- git commit --amend -m msg: 1.2s / 1.2s




So there is pretty much no change, and in particular no change attributable to the last ~2 years of git-annex evolution.

However, what remains is that a substantially more capable windows workstation (internal NVMe, faster CPU) comes nowhere near the performance of my 6 year old Debian laptop with an external USB3 drive -- despite having to go through the same smudge filter complications.

I would be grateful, if you could have a look at the windows implementation of `smudge --clean`. Please let me know what kind of contribution could help to push such an effort. Thanks!
