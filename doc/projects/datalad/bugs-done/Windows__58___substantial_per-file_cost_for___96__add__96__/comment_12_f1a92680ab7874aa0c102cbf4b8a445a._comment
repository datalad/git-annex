@adina.wagner wonderful, thanks for the second windows profile..

You need to run `git-annex init` first, unsure if you did. And 
you need to create the file `x`, containing eg "foo", and pipe
that file to `git-annex smudge --clean x`

I think your profile reflects it being stuck waiting
for stdin for some time, with the `GHC.IO.Handle.FD` at the top.
Otherwise, it would probably look more
like the one I did on window, since createProcess is near the
top. It would be good to verify that.
