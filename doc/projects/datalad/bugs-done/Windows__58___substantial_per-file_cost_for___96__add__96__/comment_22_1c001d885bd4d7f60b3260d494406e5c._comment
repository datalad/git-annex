Enabling filter.annex.process in new repositories would unfortunately
break using that repository with an older version of git-annex before that
was added to it. So it seems that `git-annex init` cannot do it for
annex.version 8 and will need to wait for v9.

Of course, if you are sure users of a repository will not be using an old
version of git-annex, it's fine to enable it.

I'm going to close this bug now, since [[todo/v9_changes]] is open to get it
enabled by default in v9.
