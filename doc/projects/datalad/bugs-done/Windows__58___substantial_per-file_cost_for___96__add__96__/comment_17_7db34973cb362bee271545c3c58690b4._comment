The new `git-annex filter-process` should improve this speed a lot.
It avoids a new process being started for each file that is added.

git config filter.annex.process 'git-annex filter-process'

That may become the default in v9, or possibly in new v8 repositories.

There is a tradeoff, since `git add` of a large file to the annex gets
slower when it's enabled. Only about 5% in my benchmarks on linux, but
maybe more on windows, I don't know.
