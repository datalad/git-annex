I don't trust this latest profile, because cmdname is a 
a field of a data structure. There's no code there to take 15% of
runtime, it's basically following a pointer.
I think probably the profiler got confused there.

Anyway, `git-annex smudge --clean x < x` is running as fast in that profile
as it does on linux, and is certainly nowhere near the 1.9s runtime of `git add`
that this bug report is about. I wonder if it also runs that fast for @mih?

Possibly something else is making git add slow.
