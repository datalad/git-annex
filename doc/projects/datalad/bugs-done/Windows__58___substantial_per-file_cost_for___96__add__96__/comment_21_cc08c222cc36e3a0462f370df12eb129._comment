@mih I've been pondering enabling filter.annex.process by default in new
repositories in Windows or generally. (Enabling it in existing repositories
kind of needs a new major version so an upgrade can set it, although introducing
repository minor versions is also a possibility.)

Enabling it earlier in datalad is fine by me, more experience with it being
used would be good.

It would also be useful to get some benchmarks of `git add` when 
large files are added to the annex (eg `git -c annex.largefiles=anything
add`). As I said, that suffers around 5% on performance on Linux, at least
when the files are small enough to still mostly fit in disk cache (1 gb on
a 4 gb system with some web browsers etc running). It may be
that Windows will pay a higher price. I don't have real Windows machines
to run such a benchmark on myself. Please post any such benchmarks
to [[todo/incremental_hashing_for_add]].
