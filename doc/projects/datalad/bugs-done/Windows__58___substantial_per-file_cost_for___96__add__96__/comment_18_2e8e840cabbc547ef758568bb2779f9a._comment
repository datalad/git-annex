Sorry for being silent for so long. I just got a contemporary machine with windows, such that hardware age should no longer be a concern for any performance comparison.

I did not yet find the time to re-assess this issue in full, but I tried the new filter-process setting with a simple `datalad create` (this only adds a few tiny files, but nevertheless took long, and was the original motivation for this issue). Enabling the new setting reduces the runtime by 25% (from 4.5s to 3.5s on average).
