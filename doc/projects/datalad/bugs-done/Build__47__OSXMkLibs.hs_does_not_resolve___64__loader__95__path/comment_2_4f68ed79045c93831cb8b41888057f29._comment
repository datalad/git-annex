install_name_tool: warning: changes being made to the file will invalidate the code signature in: tmp/build-dmg/git-annex.app/Contents/MacOS/bundle/R

This makes me doubtful that, even if the `@loader_path` problem gets resolved
and it builds, it will actually work. It seems likely that if a library is
signed, modifying it to have an invalid signature would make the OS refuse to
use it.

The OSX build used for releases is still using an older OSX and does not have
either problem. I do notice there is a similar workaround in Build/OSXMkLibs.h
for `@executable_path`; it skips such libraries. So skipping `@loader_path`
in the same place would probably build, but would it work?

Since git-annex can be installed from homebrew, I don't know if it's worth
trying to keep the standalone app working in the face of such problems.
Is there a use case for the .dmg file that this failing build is producing?

One approach would be to stop bundling system libraries, so the .dmg
perhaps is tied to a specific version of OSX. I've added a way to build
the dmg that way, make osxapp USE_SYSTEM_LIBS=1
