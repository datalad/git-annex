FTR: unfortunately not a complete workaround for us since the 'test' step is done in a clean environment (not build one), where we just install .dmg.  That results in git-annex not being able to find those dynamic libraries it had in build environment

```
Run git annex version
dyld: Library not loaded: /usr/local/opt/libmagic/lib/libmagic.1.dylib
  Referenced from: /Applications/git-annex.app/Contents/MacOS/bundle/git-annex
  Reason: image not found
error: git-annex died of signal 6
Error: Process completed with exit code 134.
```
