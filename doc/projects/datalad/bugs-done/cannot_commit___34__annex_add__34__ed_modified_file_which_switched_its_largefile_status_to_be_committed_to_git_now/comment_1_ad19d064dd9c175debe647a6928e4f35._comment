I take this as not being a bug about the partial commit
blocking (as explained in
[[!commit adc5ca70a8095a389273e7c286cb32de6873a5a3]]), which is working
around a git behavior and so can't be fixed other than by going to v6.

Instead, I think this is a bug about git annex add of an unlocked file
not converting it to a in-git file when annex.largefiles says it ought
to. If it did that it would not run into the partial commit blocking
at all. And, the observersion about git commit -a committing to the annex
not to git points at the same problem.
