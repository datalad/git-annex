In v6, `git add` rather than `git annex add` will also add it to the annex,
given annex.largefiles setting. Of course, `git annex add` can also be used
in v6 mode too. And `-n` is a flag to `git commit`, not `git add`.

Let's please not entangle this bug with that other bug. Unless your goal is
that I merge them. Bear in mind that I consider the other bug a snake pit,
and probably should have closed it as utterly useless some time ago.a

(Maybe that was uncharitable, but the other bug seems pretty well blocked
on a complete reimplementation of v6 mode leading to a v6 mode that is not
experimental, and entangling this bug into that does not seem wise.)
