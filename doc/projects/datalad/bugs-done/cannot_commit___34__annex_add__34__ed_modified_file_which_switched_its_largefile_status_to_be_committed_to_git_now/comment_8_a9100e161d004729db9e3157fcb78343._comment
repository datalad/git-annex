That other bug is closed now, and 
let to [[!commit 10138056dc240ad4265a4c473a32d4c715bbb629]].

So in v6, when annex.largefiles is not configured for a file,
git add of a modification to the file will store it however the file was
stored before. But when annex.largefiles is configured, it overrides that
default.

That didn't change the behavior of git-annex add, but we could consider
doing so. Although I don't know if it's technically possible to support
that behavior in v5 mode, due to the difficulties discussed in comment #3
above.
