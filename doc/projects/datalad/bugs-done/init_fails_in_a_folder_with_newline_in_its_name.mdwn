### Please describe the problem.

git-annex: fd:19: Data.ByteString.hGetLine: end of file

❯ git annex version
git-annex version: 10.20230214+git26-g8f2829e646-1~ndall+1
```

as `git` doesn't mind, and now annex batched commands support `-z` already for filenames with newlines in them, I think git-annex should tolerate repository folders with newlines in them too.
