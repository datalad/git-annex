I can reproduce it in a windows VM running
`git-annex test --quickcheck-replay=742853`

These quickcheck tests test random input so not flaky exactly.

Does not happen with that seed on linux, so it probably involves something
encoding specific. An area where the windows port is known to have
extensive problems.

([[!commit 1b8026b2cbc8df0274082c5f08a8b4f8ca47c5c9]] was similar, 
although that was MetaField and this appears to be MetaValue.)
