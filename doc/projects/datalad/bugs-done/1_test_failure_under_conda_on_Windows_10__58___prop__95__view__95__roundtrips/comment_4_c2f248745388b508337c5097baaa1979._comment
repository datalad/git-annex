Not sure if this is really the same bug, though certainly related. These
quickcheck tests are fuzz tests, they can find numerous bugs, that's kind of
the point of them. In any case, posting to a closed bug report risks your
followup being lost and deprioritises it.

The problem this new failure shows is that toViewPath is failing to escape the
final character in the path in some cases. Which is not a windows-specific
bug at all really, it could also happen with a metadata value such as "foo/"
being set on linux. Fixed that bug.

Which shows the point of these quickcheck fuzz tests: To be able to catch
lots of different bugs with a single test case.
