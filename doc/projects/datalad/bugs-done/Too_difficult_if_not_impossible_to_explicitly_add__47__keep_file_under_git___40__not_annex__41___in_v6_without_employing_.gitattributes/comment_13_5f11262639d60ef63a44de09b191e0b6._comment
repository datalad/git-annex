However, that leaves the case where .gitattributes configures
annex.largefiles, but that's been overridden for a file to add it to git,
and then the repo is cloned and initted with --version=6 (or upgraded).

Turns out that calling git status before enabling the smudge filter
prevents git from getting confused about the file being modified in this
case.

In the fresh clone, git has not populated the index with stat info
yet, and so it later runs the clean filter on the file, and that
respects the largefiles configuration, so the way the file is
stored in git is not taken into account.

Worked around this by adding a `git status` call to the v6
initialization/upgrade.
