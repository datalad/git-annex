Hmm, I think if annex.largefiles is configured, it should be honored. So,
the ways to convert documented on
<https://git-annex.branchable.com/tips/largefiles/> will work
with only a minor modification.

If annex.largefiles is not configured, it can check if the file was annexed
or not before, and maintain the status quo.

At least to start with I am only going to do it in the clean filter, so
`git annex add` behavior won't change, it default to annexing. It may make
sense to make `git annex add` consistent with `git add`, but that would
also need to affect v5 repositories, probably, and I don't want to entangle
a v6 bug fix with a v5 behavior change. Also, the risk of a
`git annex add` with the wrong annex.largefiles temp setting
is much smaller than the risk of forgetting to temp set annex.largefiles
when running `git commit -a`. Also, I seem to remember another todo item
discussing making this change to `git annex add` and would need to revisit
the thinking in that.

Note that a .gitattributes file might only configure largefiles for eg,
"*.c" and not for other files, thus implicitly accepting the default
largefiles for the rest. Should then `Makefile` be treated as having
largefiles configured or not? I lean toward treating it as not configured,
because then when the user temporarily overrides largefiles to add `Makefile`
to git, a modification won't accidentially go to the annex.
