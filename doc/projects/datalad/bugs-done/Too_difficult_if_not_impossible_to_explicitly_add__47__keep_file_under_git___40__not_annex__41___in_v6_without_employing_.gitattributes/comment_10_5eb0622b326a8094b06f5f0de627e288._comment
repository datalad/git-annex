Ben, I can reproduce that, but the file appearing modified in git status 
is a known  problem documented in [[todo/smudge]]. It's one
of the primary reasons that v6 mode remains experiemental.

While `git commit -a` in that clone does cause the file to be converted
from git to annex, touching the file and committing has the same effect. If
you want to juggle annexed and non-annexed files in a v6 repository without
letting annex.largefiles tell git-annex what to do, you have to manually
tell it what to do every time the file is staged. When you `git commit -a`,
you stage the file and so you need to include `-c annex.largefiles=nothing`
to keep it from transitioning to the annex.

It think it might make sense to get v6 working to the point that it's
non-experimental before worrying about such a marginal edge case as this.
