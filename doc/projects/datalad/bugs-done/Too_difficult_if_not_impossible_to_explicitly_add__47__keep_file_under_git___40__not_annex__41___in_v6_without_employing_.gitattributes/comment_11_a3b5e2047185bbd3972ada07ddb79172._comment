Actually the "some" in-git file showing as modified in status is not the
same as the git-annex get/drop showing modified in status problem. I've
fixed the latter and the former still happens.

What's happening is, git runs the clean filter, I think because this
is a fresh clone and it's not cleaned it yet. That looks at
annex.largefiles (lack of) configuration and concludes this file belongs in
the annex, so it ingests it. Rest follows the same as what I described in 
comment #2.

So yeah, that's a real problem, you clone a repo and there are suddenly
changes that mess up the painstakingly set up in-annex/in-git division.
(Note that it does not need to involve an upgrade.)

Only fix I can imagine is my old idea:

I suppose we could get around that problem with a new git-annex command
that converts a non-annexed file to an annexed file. Without a command,
this would also work: mv the file to a temp name, followed by git-annex add,
and then git mv back.
