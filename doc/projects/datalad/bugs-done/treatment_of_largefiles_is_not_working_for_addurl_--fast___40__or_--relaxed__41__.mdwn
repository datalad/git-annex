### Please describe the problem.

As described [elsewhere](http://git-annex.branchable.com/todo/make_addurl_respect_annex.largefiles_option/#comment-817c4d5c215ddc0ec7bc5c4c05dff091) but since that one is closed -- making a dedicated one

unfortunately addurl doesn't care about large files if --fast (or --relaxed, although that one I guess I can understand ):

[[!format sh """

$ chmod a+w -R /tmp/123; rm -rf /tmp/123; mkdir /tmp/123; cd /tmp/123; git init; git annex init;
Initialized empty Git repository in /tmp/123/.git/
init  ok
(recording state in git...)

$ git -c annex.largefiles=exclude=*.txt annex addurl --file=test.txt --fast \"http://www.onerussian.com/tmp/banner.png\"
addurl test.txt ok
(recording state in git...)

$ ls -l test.txt
lrwxrwxrwx 1 yoh yoh 132 Jan 13 18:44 test.txt -> .git/annex/objects/KW/kj/URL-s25319--http&c%%www.onerussian.com%tmp%banner.png/URL-s25319--http&c%%www.onerussian.com%tmp%banner.png

"""]]

it does consider largefiles for if addurl without  --fast, or --relaxed
