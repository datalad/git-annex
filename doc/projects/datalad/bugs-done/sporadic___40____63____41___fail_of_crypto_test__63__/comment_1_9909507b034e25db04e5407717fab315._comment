noticed something related to only these runs seems to me -- an odd/confusing message:

```
cron-20220405/build-ubuntu.yaml-646-67bae4b2-failed/4_test-annex (nfs-home, ubuntu-latest).txt:2022-04-05T03:10:55.6974698Z   Test subprocesses exited with unexpected exit codes: [ExitSuccess,ExitSuccess,ExitSuccess,ExitSuccess,ExitSuccess,ExitSuccess,ExitSuccess,ExitSuccess,ExitSuccess,ExitSuccess,ExitSuccess,ExitSuccess,ExitSuccess]
```

didn't do count -- may be it is \"unexpected\" in that there is 1 missing ExitSuccess? or what is unexpected otherwise?  A cleaner report would be appreciated.
