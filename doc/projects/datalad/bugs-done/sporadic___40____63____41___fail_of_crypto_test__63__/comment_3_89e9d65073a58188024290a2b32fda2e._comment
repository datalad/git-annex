Noticed this:
	
	Test subprocesses exited with unexpected exit codes: [ExitSuccess,ExitSuccess,ExitSuccess,ExitSuccess,ExitSuccess,ExitSuccess,ExitSuccess,ExitSuccess,ExitSuccess,ExitSuccess,ExitSuccess,ExitSuccess,ExitSuccess,ExitFailure 1,ExitSuccess,ExitSuccess,ExitSuccess,ExitSuccess,ExitSuccess,ExitSuccess]

In this test run: <https://github.com/datalad/git-annex/runs/6251550145?check_suite_focus=true>

There was a test failure indeed there, which was another bug that
is now fixed. But notice the `ExitFailure 1` in the list of exit codes.

The code around handing exit codes has changed from before, and still had a bug,
because a list with `ExitFailure 1` will cause that message, incorrectly.
(Now fixed that.)

But, this seems to show that it's no longer hiding the actual problem
exit code when a test fails, which it was somehow apparently doing before.
So I think this bug can be closed as fully fixed now.
