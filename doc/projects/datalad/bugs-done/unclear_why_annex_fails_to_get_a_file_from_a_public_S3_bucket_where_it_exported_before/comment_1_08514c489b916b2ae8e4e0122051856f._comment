	joey@darkstar:~/tmp/ds001419>git show git-annex:remote.log | grep openneuro.org
	336309c0-d7f8-430e-bd2b-4bdc61e587cb bucket=openneuro.org datacenter=US encryption=none exporttree=yes fileprefix=ds001419/ host=s3.amazonaws.com name=s3-PUBLIC partsize=1GiB port=80 public=yes publicurl=yes storageclass=STANDARD type=S3 timestamp=1537895418.565736858s

publicurl=yes means that the bucket's url is "yes".

Since constructing an URI object from that invalid url fails, the url
downloader fails early and this avoids the debug output that would normally be
shown too when downloading an url by recent versions of git-annex.

This also explains probably why whereis doesn't list any urls.
