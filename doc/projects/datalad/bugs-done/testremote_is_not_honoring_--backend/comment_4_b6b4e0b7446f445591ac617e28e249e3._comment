Sorry for the long silence. Coming back to this issue I find the behavior changed, but not sufficiently to get the test suite to run in full on windows.

I ran `git annex testremote --fast` on Windows `msys_nt-10.0-17763` with git-annex 10.20230227-ga206cdddb4 and git 2.38.1.windows.1

Right now, I cannot say whether this is pointing to a problem in my implementation or still to something in git-annex. However, the same implementation passes the test suite on linux.

Sidenote: I am not sure of you have access to a windows system for debugging. If this is needed or helpful, please let me know.

Thanks!
