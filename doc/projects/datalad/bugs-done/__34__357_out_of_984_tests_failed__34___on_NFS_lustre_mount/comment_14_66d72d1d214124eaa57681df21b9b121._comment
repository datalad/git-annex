It seems likely to me that this NFS server is just broken. Why would a
well-designed NFS server behave this way, rather than letting a chmod
override the xattr that was set earlier?

I considered filing a bug report on coreutils or something about cp
preserving the NFS xattr leading to this problem, but since it seems likely
to be the NFS server on the NAS that is at fault, didn't think that would
be productive. 

If you did manage to reproduce that behavior with a regular
linux NFS server, it seems like it would be a grounds for a bug on some
part of linux..
