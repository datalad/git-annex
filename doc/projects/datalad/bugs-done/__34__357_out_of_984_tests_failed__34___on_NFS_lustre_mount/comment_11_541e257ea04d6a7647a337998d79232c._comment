I've made the change to use that option. I think this should clear the test
suite.

I see that Isilon is a NAS, so some proprietary and broken NFS server
apparently. Kind of explains why cp -a would do this, because I found
threads about cp -a preserving NFS xattrs, and people wanted it to,
presumably for other reasons on less broken NFS servers.

This does raise the question of what might happen if someone copies
a file themselves with cp -a on this NFS and then git-annex adds the copy.
Probably git-annex would then be unable to remove the write bit
from the annex object file. 

I also worried about ACLS, but it seems like ACLs do not have this
problem, because chmod a-w causes the write ACL that was set to be
effectively unset:

	joey@darkstar:~>chmod -w foo
	joey@darkstar:~>setfacl -m g:nogroup:rw foo
	joey@darkstar:~>ls -l foo
	-r--rw-r--+ 1 joey joey 0 Aug 27 12:53 foo
	nobody@darkstar:/home/joey$ echo test >> foo
	joey@darkstar:~>chmod a-w foo
	joey@darkstar:~>ls -l foo
	-r--rw-r--+ 1 joey joey 0 Aug 27 12:53 foo
	nobody@darkstar:/home/joey$ echo test >> foo
	bash: foo: Permission denied
	joey@darkstar:~>getfacl foo
	# file: foo
	# owner: joey
	# group: joey
	user::r--
	group::r--
	group:nogroup:rw-		#effective:r--
	mask::r--
	other::r--

I've verified that git-annex add also clears the write ACL.
