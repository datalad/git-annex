The "retrieveKeyFile resume from 0%" test
starts by writing an empty file with default permissions.
It then does the download storing to that file.

The permission denied is happening when trying to open that file
later, to write to it. So this seems like a umask or some other
kind of permissions problem. Maybe filesystem related in some way,
if the filesystem is somehow not honoring permissions, but that would
not be my first or second guess.

The other 2 failures shown do chain on from that
initial failure, since that test does some things that the
later tests depend on. Looking through the log, there are several other
test failures that also seem due to permissions, that all look like this,
or probably chain from this:

	  add:  FAIL (4.08s)
	    ./Test/Framework.hs:324:
	    unable to modify sha1foo

And that error message happens when it's checking that the file
permissions include the write bit.

So, your next step should be something like:

	umask
	touch foo
	ls -l foo
	echo foo >> foo

I tried with `umask 0222` (new files lack any write bit) but it failed a lot
earlier, while setting up the test suite. Which seems ok itself given how
restricted and weird that umask is. If the test suite overrode the umask, it
would not notice if some actual reasonable umask caused problems. But I'm
getting ahead of confirmation that it is a umask problem.
