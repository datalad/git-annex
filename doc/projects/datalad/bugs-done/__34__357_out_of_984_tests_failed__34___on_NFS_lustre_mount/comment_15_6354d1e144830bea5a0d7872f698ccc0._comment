FWIW, I've tested a debianstadalone build of `8.20210803+git153-g63c2cfd47-1~ndall+1` on that system, and besides 3 fails due to no `--kill` in elderly system wide gpgconf (apparently debian bundle does not come with one) -- it is all clean! (although took nearly a full work day to complete on that filesystem: `3 out of 984 tests failed (18157.38s)`)
