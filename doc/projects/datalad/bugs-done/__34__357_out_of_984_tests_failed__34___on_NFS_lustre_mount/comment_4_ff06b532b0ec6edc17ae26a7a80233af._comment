Somehow the write bit is not being set. Since the umask is ok, the next
most likely thing seems to be NFS either not setting it, or temporarily
forgetting it's set, or the file somehow being created owned by a different
user.

Could run: `git-annex test --keep-failures` and then when it gets
to one of the "unable to modify foo" failures, it will print out the path
to the repository that it failed in, and you can "ls -l" the path,
which should include the "foo" file.
