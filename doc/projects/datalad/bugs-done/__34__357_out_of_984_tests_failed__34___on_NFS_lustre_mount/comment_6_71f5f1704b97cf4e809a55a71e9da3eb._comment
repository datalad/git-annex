So confirmed to be actual missing write bits.

I think that the next step is going to be to dig through a `strace -f -s 1024`, 
of the "resume from 0" file that has the permission denied problem, 
and of the ".t/tmprepo5/foo" file that is somehow not writable.

Then I can compare with a strace where it does not fail, to see
if it's doing something different.
