### Please describe the problem.

Ideally annex should detect all "paranormal" cases such as running on NFS mounted partition, but according to [https://git-annex.branchable.com/bugs/huge_multiple_copies_of___39__.nfs__42____39___and___39__.panfs__42____39___being_created/](https://git-annex.branchable.com/bugs/huge_multiple_copies_of___39__.nfs__42____39___and___39__.panfs__42____39___being_created/).  Happily ignorant we were running annex (5.20151116-g76139a9) on NFS mounted partition until we filled up 2TB of allocated to us space with .nfs* files.  Well -- apparently according to above we should have tried pidlock... trying now but doesn't work :-/

BTW running move in our old now somewhat screwed up annex, results in a differently expressed error: [http://www.onerussian.com/tmp/2016-02-29.png](http://www.onerussian.com/tmp/2016-02-29.png)
