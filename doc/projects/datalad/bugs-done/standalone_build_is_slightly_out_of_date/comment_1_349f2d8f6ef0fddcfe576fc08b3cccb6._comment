That's 6 commits back from the release tag for 6.20180913.
The only code change missed is 
[[!commit a7f0b99a3334fbc73e3cb53f37f5a065ee14b135]],
which does not affect this build because this build bundles a newer version
of git than the one that commit is dealing with.

Without changing git-annex's build infrastructure to something that builds
on released tags, a minor skew like this is to be expected, since I just
ship the latest daily autobuilds with the release.
