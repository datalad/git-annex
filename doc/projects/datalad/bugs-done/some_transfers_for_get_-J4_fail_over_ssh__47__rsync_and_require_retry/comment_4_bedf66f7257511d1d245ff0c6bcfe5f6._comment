Whatever caused rsync to fail like this, git-annex no longer even uses
rsync in gets from git remotes, unless the remote has a git-annex-shell
older than 6.20180316. Ie, debian oldstable.

So it seems unlikely that whatever the problem was is still relevant.
There is not enough information here to say anything more. I'm gonna close
this, but do repopen it if it comes back.
