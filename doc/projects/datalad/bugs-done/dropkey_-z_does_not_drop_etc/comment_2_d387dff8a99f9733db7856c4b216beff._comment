However, after successfully dropping all the keys with `--print0`, there
is then this oddity:

	git-annex: Batch input parse failure: bad key

That's a bug in nul splitting when there's a trailing nul. Oops. I've
fixed that.

Also while I reproduced the rest of the behavior, I didn't see this part:

	commitBuffer: resource vanished 

I'm not sure which command that comes from. Probably I think the findkeys,
if its entire output was not consumed for some reason.
