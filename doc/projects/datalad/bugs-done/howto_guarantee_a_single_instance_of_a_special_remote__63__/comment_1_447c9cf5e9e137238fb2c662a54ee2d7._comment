When I try this with ssh remotes, which should act the same as external
special remotes as far as git-annex get behavior is concerned,
git-annex get moves on to the next remote that has the file when the first
one fails.

I think the difference might come down to the handling of the failed
PREPARE. That throws an exception, so terminates the get action for that
file.

Indeed, there are quite a few `giveup` in Remote/External.hs, and while
some of them are reasonable exceptions to throw, it needs an audit for ones
that throw an exception when there's a better way to indicate failure like
return False.
