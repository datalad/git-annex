The async extension to the protocol guarantees only a single process will
be run. The remote might be asked to start several operations
concurrently, but if it wants to queue them sequentially, that should be
fine.

While it might be a bit of a round about way to get this functionality,
since the extension complicates the protocol a bit, I'm inclined to feel
it's enough, and not add this other extension, 
at least without some more compelling use case.
