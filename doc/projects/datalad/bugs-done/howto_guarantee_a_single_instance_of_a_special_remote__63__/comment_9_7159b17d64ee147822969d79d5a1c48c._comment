Sorry for being anal with my questions and not just trying it out... but by `The async extension to the protocol guarantees only a single process will be run.` which of the following scenarios do you mean

- a. there will be no parallel workers if `--jobs N` is specified (thus a single process for an external remote)
- b. there are parallel workers, and a single instance of an external special remote will be ran and either 
   - b.1. only one worker would be able to talk to it
   - b.2. parallel workers will talk to the same async external special remote

or may be some other c. or b.3  ?
