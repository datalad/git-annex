Fairly sure it's something to do with the chunk log. The tests with no
chunks succeed, so the subsequent failures could be due to it failing to
see information about chunks used to store the key when it then tries to
retrieve it.

Aha: It's using Annex.eval, so it does stuff, and throws away the changed
state. So, after writing to the journal, when journalIgnorable = False,
it will then forget that, and will try to read from the branch, ignoring
the journal.

I checked all Annex.eval, and all the rest have the pattern 
Annex.eval =<< Annex.new. This is the only one that *reuses*
an old state across multiple Annex.eval. And it's not like the commit that
triggered this made Annex.eval more dangerous; that were never a good thing
to do and probably only didn't break on some other state being lost before
due to luck.
