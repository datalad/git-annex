I've just added annex.pidlock to git-annex. Configure that to true, and it
will use one top-level pid lock file, rather than these posix locks. Might
work better on NFS.

annex.pidlock is enabled automatically if probing detects that posix locks
cannot be made at all. However, if the NFS lets posix locks be made, just
with the poor behavior described here, the probing can't detect that and so
you'd need to enable it manually.
