Hmm, but the special remote can add urls to the whereis output, indeed it
is doing so in your example. So if the repository has the special remote
enabled it seems it ought to need it to be in working order.

External special remote programs are only spun up on demand, so the only
way to get to this crash is when it's actually being used for something,
AFAICS.
