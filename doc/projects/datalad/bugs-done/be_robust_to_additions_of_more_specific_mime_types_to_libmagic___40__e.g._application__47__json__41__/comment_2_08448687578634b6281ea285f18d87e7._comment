Yes, mimeencoding=binary is intended for those cases where you just want a
robust (presumably) text/binary division.

The "any mimetype matches" approach seems like it could break things too.
Consider:

	(not mimetype=text/plain and (mimetype=text/* or mimetype=application/json)) or mimetype=AI/buggy

Currently a shell script is found to be only text/x-shellscript,
so it would match the above. If git-annex were changed to consider
all reported mime types, the shell script, being also text/plain
would not match.

And then, once the mime database solves the halting problem and helpfully
starts flagging shell scripts as AI/buggy (all shell scripts are presumably
buggy so maybe that AI has an easy job), the behavior on the above example
would change for a third time, back to matching.
