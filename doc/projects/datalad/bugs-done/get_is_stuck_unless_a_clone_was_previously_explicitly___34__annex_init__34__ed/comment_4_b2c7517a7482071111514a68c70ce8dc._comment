This is the same class of bug as
[[!commit 82448bdf39bbe2b4fb6e0bac0735b845d52e189a]] fixed.

Subsequent to that fix, I audited for other bugs in this class
and tried to fix them too 
in [[!commit 96f6aa39dda335bf9aa25ed8a67756e31bd307c2]].
What that commit missed was that runsGitAnnexChildProcess only
affects running git commands, while actually in all 3 places touched by
that commit, git-annex runs other, non-git commands that result in git-annex
being run. So all 3 of those can still deadlock like this, and actually
that commit made it worse by making them always deadlock, rather than only
theoretically deadlock in some case where some other part of git-annex
happened to have taken the pid lock at the same time.

(Not really deadlock, I think, but wait for the annex.pidlocktimeout 
and then fail after 5 minutes.)
