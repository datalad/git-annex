A variant of this where an annexed unlocked file is added first,
then the file is touched, and then some other file is added
with -c annex.largefiles=nothing does result in the clean filter sending
the whole annexed file content back to git, rather than keeping it annexed.
For whatever reason, git does not store that content in .git/objects or
update the index for that file though, so it doesn't show up as a change.

So *apparently* that variant is only potentially an expensive cat of a
large annexed file, and does not need to be dealt with. Unless git
sometimes behaves otherwise.
