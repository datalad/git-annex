That statement was based on me being able to trigger a stall locally
in the same test on my Buster system.  The changes from datalad's pr
5151 resolved the hang on my end, as well as the hang from the
stripped down demo I added here.

However, with the changes from pr 5151 merged, it turns out the the
stall on the Ubuntu 18.04 CI is still there [1].  So, it's unclear
what's going on.  Perhaps 7245a9ed5 isn't even what triggered the hang
on the CI, though the stall seems to have first appeared 14 days ago
on a build using 7e24b2587 [2], so the timing is at least consistent
with 7245a9ed5 being the culprit.
