Seems the problem with hWaitForInput happens when running it concurrently
with hGetLine on the same handle. When I run it sequentially, it does seem
to work. Ok.. I was able to implement hGetLineUntilExitOrEOF that seems to
work.

I've converted it to use that, and the test case for this bug is fixed.
Also, the sleep based workaround
in [[!commit aa492bc65904a19f22ffdfc20d7a5e7052e2f54d]] is removed,
and it uses hGetLineUntilExitOrEOF instead.

However, I still want to do the audit of other things that pipe stderr.
Some of them don't do line based input, so will need a different function
than hGetLineUntilExitOrEOF. Leaving this bug open until that audit is
done.
