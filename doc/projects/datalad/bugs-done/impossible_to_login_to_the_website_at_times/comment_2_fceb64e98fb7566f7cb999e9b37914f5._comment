happened to me again on firefox, where I first went to http://git-annex.branchable.com/bugs/ to file a new report, was directed to login, entered credentials, got error message.  I have then removed cookies, went in a new tab to the bugs, this bug, and then was able to login.
So it is cookies related, but IMHO not a user fault
