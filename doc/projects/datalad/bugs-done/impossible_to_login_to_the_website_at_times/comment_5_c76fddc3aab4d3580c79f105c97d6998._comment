OK. I think I have figured out the issue (at least in my case). I guess that I had logged into https://git-annex.branchable.com, then tried to visit the non-secure URL http://git-annex.branchable.com this is when I got the error.

Taking a look at the cookie I send when visiting https://git-annex.branchable.com I see that it has the secure flag set. Which I think means that my browser will refuse to send this cookie when I visit the http://git-annex.branchable.com and will refuse to receive another cookie (since its the same domain).

If I clear my cookies and login via http://git-annex.branchable.com, the cookie does not have the secure flag set.

This means that ikiwiki is serving cookies with different flags for http vs https. Probably related to this feature? <https://ikiwiki.info/todo/use_secure_cookies_for_ssl_logins/>. Anyhow it seems this isn't quite working as desired. I think it is possible to serve two different cookies (one for http and one for https) but ikiwiki does not appear to be doing that.
