Hmm, I wonder if I was aware that any externals used GETCONFIG with things
like name. Seems I might have heard about it at one point and forgotten?
Reading the external protocol, it does say it's anything passed to
initremote.

I've fixed this. Release should happen by tomorrow.

(I've also backported the fix to the 7.x branch.)
