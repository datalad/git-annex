The sqlite open files is a red herring: That happened only when
using a remote in a local directory. Anyway, I've fixed that.

The open files I'm seeing now in my artifical
test case (two local repos with 1000 unlocked files, git-annex get between them, lsof
-Ki run after that's moved 500 files, while the git-annex process is suspended):

	no -J	48
	-J2	104
	-J5	185
	-J32	964

Which seems fine, 28 file handles per -J increment.

If you have something worse than that, show me the lsof.
