Implemented the cat-file pool. Capped at 2 cat-files of each distinct type,
so it will start a max of 8 no matter the -J level.

(Although cat-file can also be run in those repositories so there will be
more then.)

While testing, I noticed git-anenx drop -Jn starts n git check-attr
processes, so the same thing ought to be done with them. Leaving this bug open
for that, but I do think that the problem you reported should be fixed now.
