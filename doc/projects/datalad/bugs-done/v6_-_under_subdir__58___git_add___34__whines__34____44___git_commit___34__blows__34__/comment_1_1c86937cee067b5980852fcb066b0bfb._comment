HA -- it is compatibility issue with git somewhere.  
I had system wide 1:2.13.0~rc1+next.20170430-1~nd90+1  installation of git, and that was the reason.  Similar blows with 1:2.11.0-3+nd1~nd90+1, but works fine with 1:2.19.0~rc2-1 .
At least that explains how we did not run into it while testing in DataLad:

1. we use git bundled with git-annex when git annex standalone is installed
2. We use \"git annex add\" and not \"git add\" directly even in v6 mode repos

But it brings the point of possibly needing to test with a regular debian build of git annex more  which would use system-wide git. Also that may be git annex should test git version used and blow with informative message whenever git is too old?
