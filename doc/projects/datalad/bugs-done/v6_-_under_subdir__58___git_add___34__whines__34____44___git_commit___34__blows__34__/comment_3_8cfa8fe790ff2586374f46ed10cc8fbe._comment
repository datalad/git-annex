Ah yes, I was remembering this workaround in git-annex:

	* v6: Work around git bug that runs smudge/clean filters at the top of the
	  repository while passing them a relative GIT_WORK_TREE that may point
	  outside of the repository, by using GIT_PREFIX to get back to the
	  subdirectory where a relative GIT_WORK_TREE is valid.

Perhaps that broke with some older versions of git.
[[!commit e50ed4ba48f93cf0addb3638a4a9605a10f17976]]
has the gory details, which includes a git bug.

A good way to debug this is to set:

	git config filter.annex.clean 'bash -c "set | grep GIT_ >&2; pwd >&2; git-annex smudge --clean %f"'

Then when git runs the clean filter it will display the git environment variables.
