ok, if instead I do use more fragile version where I do adjust `A:` ACLs instead of just adding the `D:`

<details>
<summary>here are the two commands to freeze/thaw</summary> 

```shell

nfs4_getfacl \"$@\" | sed -e 's,:rwadxtTnN,:rxtn,g' | nfs4_setfacl -S- \"$@\"


nfs4_getfacl \"$@\" | sed -e 's,:rxtn,:rwadxtTnN,g' | nfs4_setfacl -S- \"$@\"


```
</details>

then  I do get `ls -l` reporting that write bit is not set, and `git annex` seems to be happy then... heh.  So I guess some recipe like this could be used , but I still would prefer to avoid needing in-place changes of such \"detailed\" permissions listings in those ACLs.
