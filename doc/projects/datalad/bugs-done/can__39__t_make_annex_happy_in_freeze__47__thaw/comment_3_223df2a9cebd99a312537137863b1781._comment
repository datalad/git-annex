Looks like, while init does run the freeze hook in its test,
as well as trying to remove the write bits (which it always does, freeze
hook or no freeze hook), it still checks if the file's write permissions
got removed.

I think that, in order to support filesystems where chmod -w has no effect,
init should skip looking at write perms when there is a freeze hook. It can
still check that freezing prevents writing to a file.

Hmm, init uses checkContentWritePerm to see if the write permission is
removed. That is also used by fsck, and when ingesting a file. So even if
it were fixed in init, those would still be problems. This really needs to
be fixed in checkContentWritePerm.
