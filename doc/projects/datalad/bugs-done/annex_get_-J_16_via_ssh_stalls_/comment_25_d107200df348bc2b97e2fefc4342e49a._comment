> I've seen the test fail that way, where apparently all gets from the remote repo are failing, on the autobuilders once or twice, but not reproducably...

Unfortunately this time I was not as fortunate to reliably reproduce it (yet) :-(  for me I believe it happened for the first time ever although I could be wrong.
How do you know which test(s) fail and how to restart only a failing test (e.g. by name?) -- I find it difficult to parse logged output to figure out test names/boundaries since intermixed with git output etc which also includes error messages on conflicts etc.
