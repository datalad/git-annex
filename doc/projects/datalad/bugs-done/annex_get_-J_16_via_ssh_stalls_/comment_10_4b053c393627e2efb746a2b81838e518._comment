First, you have not disabled sshcaching, because the value to disable it is
not "no" but "false". So please try again with sshcaching disabled..

	Oct  4 16:25:28 localhost sshd[11700]: Received disconnect from 129.XXX.XXX.XXX port 40080:11: disconnected by user

Looks like something on the client side or in the middle is closing the TCP
connection, and I think not in a clean shutdown way, but hard.

I'm fairly sure the git-annex is not stopping the ssh process it used to open
that connection though. The "hGetChar: illegal operation" is because it's still
trying to read from ssh after it exited. So it seems we need to find out why
the ssh process on the client side is exiting (assuning the same thing happens
with sshcaching disabled). strace?

You mentioned NFS.. Which repo is on NFS, the client or the server?
