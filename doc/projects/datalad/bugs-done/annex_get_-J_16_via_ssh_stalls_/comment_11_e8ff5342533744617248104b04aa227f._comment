`=false` instead of `=no` seems to make no difference:

> `... strace?`

I've provided a URL to strace log in an email from 3 Oct 2018 (msg id 20181003182901.GM3684@hopa.kiewit.dartmouth.edu).  Now will collect one more with the `=false` and follow up to that email with url to this fresh trace (do not want to share them publicly happen some sensitive information is recorded/leaks)

Server.  I've emailed mount options in a private communication on Fri, 5 Oct 2018 (message id 20181005201504.GH3978@hopa.kiewit.dartmouth.edu)
