Interestingly, the P2P debug in
<http://git-annex.branchable.com/bugs/annex_get_-J_16_via_ssh_stalls_/#comment-34b66436c1a2f2d9479f948655375bb5>
shows two ssh processes started, but then git-annex sends "VERSION 1" three
times. And the remote only replies to two of those.

Could that indicate two threads are somehow talking to the same ssh?
I've instrumented --debug with more information to find out, so 
please try again with [[!commit fcca7adaffe86673dade3790f80e22ee426b51e7]].
