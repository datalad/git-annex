> All this debug output means nothing to me, what operation is it stalling on?

Do you mean that command I have pasted in the beginning `git annex get -J 16 --debug --json-progress .`? if something else, I cannot add beyond that command and `--debug` output.

Ha, good question... seems to be not?:

[[!format sh \"\"\"

Cloning into 'QA'...

$> cd QA

$> find -lname */SHA256E-s1633--1bc7a100b82cd31d084aae5b25b8d90af128324d10d92cfc9e2196d28829d375.tsv

\"\"\"]]
the only thing is that I have interrupted some previous stalled `get` invocations so may be it is somehow related?
