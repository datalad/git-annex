It seems to be stalled waiting for data to come in from the pipe from ssh.
Both the protocol debug and the emailed strace look like that.

I think it's quite likely that this is something in ssh being unhappy with
a large number of connections. ssh also seems to be closing some of the
connections while git-annex is still using them.

It would be worth disabling annex.sshcaching to at least eliminate that
part of ssh.

It would probably make sense to look at the ssh server's logs and see if
it's throttling connections.

FWIW, I tried a git-annex get -J64 from localhost using ssh and it worked
without any problems.
