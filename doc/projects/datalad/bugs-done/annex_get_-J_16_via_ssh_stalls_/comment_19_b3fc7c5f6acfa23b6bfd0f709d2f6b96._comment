I've seen the test fail that way, where apparently all gets from the remote
repo are failing, on the autobuilders once or twice, but not reproducably,
so have not been able to track it down yet.

(I was running the test suite hundreds of times overnight
in a loop to reproduce and fix other intermittent test failures
just before the v7 release, and never reproduced that failure pattern.)

If you can reproduce that test failure we can work on debugging 
it on a different bug report.

Anyway, since it replied to DATA for that key, the fix in
[[!commit 0b053b96119c1a2d6c2d03ba7f98f032e89b8b66]] almost certianly can't
be for the same problem as this bug.
