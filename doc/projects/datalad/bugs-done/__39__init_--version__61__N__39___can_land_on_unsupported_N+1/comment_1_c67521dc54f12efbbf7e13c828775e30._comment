Your patch is perfectly fine haskell code.

But, looking at it, the problem is deeper than init --version.
Running git-annex in a v3 repo produces a v5 repo,
then running git-annex again produces a v6 repo,
then v7, then v8.

So the problem is really that autoUpgradeableVersions
should map everything to latestVersion. At least currently,
since all versions should be upgraded to v8.

(Really it could just be a list of versions that all
are assumed to upgrade to latestVersion, but I left it a map
in case at some point there are two concurrent version
tracks without an autoupgrade between them.)

Anyway, attach a git format-patch next time so I can git am it. :)
