Easy enough to exclude them from export, that's done.

But the other side of the coin is, importing back from there will generate
a remote-tracking branch without the submodule, and merging it will result
in a tree that does not include the submodule, as if it were deleted.

So, importing needs to somehow add back submodules, 
unless the submodule location has been overwritten with a file on the remote.
