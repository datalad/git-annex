Let's not diagnose a concurrency problem prematurely.

I've run many concurrent gets and never seen masses of failures, or indeed any
failures without either an error message explaining why it failed, or something
obviously wrong (like the drive not being mounted).

The json output is making it harder than necessary to understand what's going on.
It seems you should be easily able to replicate the same problem without --json.
