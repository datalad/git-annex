2a8fdfc7d (Display a warning message when asked to operate on a file
inside a directory that's a symbolic link to elsewhere, 2020-05-11)
made `git annex add` error like `git add` does rather than silently
doing nothing in a scenario like below.

[[!format sh """
# <repo>
# |-- a
# |   `-- f0
# `-- alink -> a
cd "$(mktemp -d "${TMPDIR:-/tmp}"/gx-link-XXXXXXX)"
git init && git annex init
mkdir a
ln -sT a alink
echo 0 >alink/f0
git annex add alink/f0
"""]]

Unlike git, however, git-annex's warning also applies when the
symbolic link is upstream of the repository and git-annex is passed an
absolute path.

[[!format sh """
# .
# |-- a
# |   `-- repo
# |       `-- f0
# `-- alink -> a
cd "$(mktemp -d "${TMPDIR:-/tmp}"/gx-link-XXXXXXX)"
mkdir a
ln -sT a alink
git init alink/repo
(
    cd alink/repo
    git annex init
    echo 0 >f0
    git annex add "$(pwd)"/f0
)
"""]]

```
[...]
git-annex: /tmp/gx-link-Wxqnzo8/alink/repo/f0 is beyond a symbolic link
add f0
ok
(recording state in git...)
```

The file does appear to be annexed and added to the index despite the
warning:

```
$ git diff --cached
diff --git a/f0 b/f0
new file mode 120000
index 0000000..7a725b9

```

Looking at `Seek.workTreeItems'`, my first thought was that the above
scenario should not error: `relPathCwdToFile` should turn the absolute
path into `f0` when it compares it against the current working
directory, `/tmp/gx-link-Wxqnzo8/alink/repo/`.  However, it looks like
`System.Directory.getCurrentDirectory` returns a resolved path for the
current working directory, so `relPathCwdToFile` turns the absolute
path into `../../alink/repo/f0`, which gets flagged by the
`viasymlink` check.

This error message is of course easy enough to work around on the
caller's side, but since it looks like an unintended consequence of
2a8fdfc7d, the change in behavior seems worth mentioning.
