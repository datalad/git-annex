Another way this could be dealt with is to move the sqlite databases to
a local filesystem.

Since git-annex only ever uses them for caching information from git, it
can rebuild them, so even a tempfs would work. And it would also be ok if
two git-annex processes accessing the same repo used different sqlite
databases, since they would both build up the same information.
(Even if they were on different computers using a network filesystem.)

This could be done with a git config. And perhaps get `git-annex init`
to somehow probe for this problem and set the git config. Although, what
path would it set it to?

(Note that gitAnnexKeysDbIndexCache would also need to be moved since it
contains information about the content of a sqlite database.)
