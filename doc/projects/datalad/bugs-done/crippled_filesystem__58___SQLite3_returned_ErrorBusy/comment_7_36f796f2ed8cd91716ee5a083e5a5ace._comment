I notice that `git annex init` is not able to detect that posix locks are not
working (I assume they are not), so it doesn't enable pid locking. You
should run: `git config annex.pidlock true`

That could be improved: The current probe only tries to set an
exclusive lock, but does not verify that the exclusive lock has any effect.
But I'm a bit wary about all the ways verifying the lock could go wrong
given that the posix locks are violating posix. Trying to take the lock
nonblocking might block forever or any other undefined behavior.

It does seem that init ought to test if sqlite can be used, and
fail early otherwise. Better to learn about the problem before you start
using the repository.
