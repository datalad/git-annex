It looks more like a locking problem than a permission problem.

Anyway, you've certainly shown that sqlite is not able to work well on that
filesystem. 

I forgot was that git-annex uses WAL mode for the database,
and that will change how sqlite does locking. Can you please try this
on a new database file:

	sqlite3 /media/mydisk/tmp/db.new
	PRAGMA journal_mode=WAL;
	create table foo (name varchar);
	insert into foo (name) values ("joey")
	.exit
