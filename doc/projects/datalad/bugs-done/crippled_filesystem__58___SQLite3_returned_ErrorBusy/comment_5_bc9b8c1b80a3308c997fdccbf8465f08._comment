I've found several discussions about Sqlite on CIFS.

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42722855/sqlite-3-on-windows-share-cifs-access-from-ubuntu-nobrl-risk

That also had all write actions fail with "locked".
It suggests mounting the CIFS filesystem with the "nobrl" mount option.
Another thread suggested instead the "nolock" mount option.

Those may be worth trying, although I'd make sure that

1. annex.pidlock is set to true in the repository's git config.
As long as it is, disabling locking at the database level is not unsafe,
since only one git-annex process will be able to use the database.

2. You only ever use git-annex on one computer at a time in a given
repository on this CIFS drive.
