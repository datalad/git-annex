I've implemented probing by `git-annex init`, and it will display
this message to help the user get it configured:

	init  
	  Detected a filesystem where Sqlite does not work.
	
	  (sqlite worker thread crashed: user error (SQLite3 returned ErrorBusy while attempting to perform close(synthetic)(after successful open)))
	
	  To work around this problem, you can set annex.dbdir to a directory on another filesystem.
	
	  For example: git config annex.dbdir $HOME/cache/git-annex
	
	git-annex: Not initialized.

Going to close the bug since I think this is the best that it can be handled.
