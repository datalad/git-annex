It's easy to have multiple versions of git-annex installed. Especially
when a repository is shared amoung users, who may install different
versions for their own reasons.

I am not happy either about this weakening of safety guarantees that indirect
mode repositories otherwise have. It seems at least worth a big fat
warning.

I don't feel comfortable changing locking without a major repository
version change, which would be a Big Deal.

Anyhow the file mode and directory mode are both needed to protect annexed
files. Making the file read-only will not prevent a lot of things
renaming over top of it. (Including vim!)
