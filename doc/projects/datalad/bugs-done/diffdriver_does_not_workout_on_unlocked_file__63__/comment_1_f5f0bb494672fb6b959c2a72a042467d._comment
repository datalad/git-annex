Let's see, I have a file foo that was added, locked, and committed.
I then unlock foo, and modify it. Then I run

	GIT_EXTERNAL_DIFF='git-annex diffdriver -- my-diff --' git diff HEAD

And my-diff is a shell script that prints "$@". So I see:

	foo .git/annex/objects/W8/Zw/SHA256E-s30--9e179ece66f95419f996974c1e478294d6d6e8ea3eee2e6694d1d2fba5d82704/SHA256E-s30--9e179ece66f95419f996974c1e478294d6d6e8ea3eee2e6694d1d2fba5d82704 ebf7004afbf3838eaad7db6af8b77eb21eb1f810 120000 foo 0000000000000000000000000000000000000000 100644

$2 is the old content of the file, which git-annex diffdriver has correctly
fixed up to be the annex object file. $5 is the new version of the file
which git-annex has not touched, but it's "foo" in the working tree, which is right.

So that's ok, what about the other way around. Start with foo being unlocked,
commit that, then modify it, and add it locked. Now I see:

	foo /home/joey/tmp/5klQtl_foo 1a822e679e46982e0119f0ea725aaaffc6954f4b 100644 .git/annex/objects/wm/ZV/SHA256E-s8--ca7eb6f8a60a1abaddc1df52662184d6e7b33feca3cb5165343321dc35aeda17/SHA256E-s8--ca7eb6f8a60a1abaddc1df52662184d6e7b33feca3cb5165343321dc35aeda17 3ba78f367ca1a5b5bf6a4054a117d5d9a013073a 120000

Here git-annex diffdriver has correctly fixed up $5, but $2 is left as-is,
and if I have it cat that tmp file, it's "/annex/objects/SHA..."; the git-annex
link used for the locked file.

Ok, now I understand. :)
