Seems that it's only merging from remotes/origin/synced/master, not
remotes/origin/master. When `git annex sync` is used in the first
repository, that works, but not when `git commit` is used.

And it's due to being in direct mode because the annex/direct/master
branch is checked out, so it tries to merge from
remotes/origin/direct/master, which doesn't exist.

This does not seem to be a reversion, but a long-ago oversight.
