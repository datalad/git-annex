fixed a problem where git-annex init entered an adjusted branch
unexpectedly.

Entering an adjusted branch involves creating a master branch at init time,
because it has to have a branch existing in order to adjust it.

So, these bugs appear to have the same cause. I'll close this dup.

But, note that the same thing could happen if git-annex init were run on a
crippled filesystem, so it may be your test needs to deal with
such a new-born master branch.
