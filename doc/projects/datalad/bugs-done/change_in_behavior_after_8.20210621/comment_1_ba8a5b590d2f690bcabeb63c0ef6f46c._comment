In the linked issue, it is apparently bisected to 
[[!commit 4b1b9d7a83f0da71665658e6234e699e182cbddc]] which added
annex.freezecontent-command.

But unless you're setting that config, I don't see it changing behavior,
and if you are setting that config, it kind of follows that the behavior
change is due to whatever you set it to?
