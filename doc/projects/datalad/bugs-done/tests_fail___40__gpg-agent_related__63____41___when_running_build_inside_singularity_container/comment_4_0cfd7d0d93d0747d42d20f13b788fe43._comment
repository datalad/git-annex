I guess your command there would need to be run in a directory /home/runner/work/datalad-extensions
to replicate the path I saw earlier.

I did try it, but the singulatriy pull is failing with "While pulling shub
image: download did not succeed: 400 Bad Request".

Running it in some directory like /tmp avoiding the problem
more or less confirms my hypothesis that it's a socket path length
problem. Both /tmp/build and /home/yoh/build are much shorter than
/home/runner/work/datalad-extensions/datalad-extensions/build.
