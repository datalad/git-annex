Thank you Joey!
TL;DR: If you don't manage to reproduce it with the call below -- let's consider the issue doesn't exist ;) at least I found a workaround.

if you would like to try, after `apt-get install singularity-container`:
 
```
git clone git://github.com/datalad/datalad-extensions -b enh-git-annex && cd datalad-extensions && scripts/ci/build_git_annex build
```
(it might ask for a passkey to your gpg at some point - building signed pkgs) -- it might or might not fail for you!

Ghosts: it fails if I just run `scripts/ci/build_git_annex build` in my original local git repository. If, instead of `build/` I am providing some path outside of current directory (i.e. not just `build`) when I am under $HOME -- it seems to work.  So I started to build out under /tmp/git-annex and github actions seems to pass now!: https://github.com/datalad/datalad-extensions/runs/547292760?check_suite_focus=true

But it also passes for me when I do above like under `/tmp/` , or when I provide build directory still somewhere in my home, e.g. `~/build`.
I think it is some singularity bind mounts madness somehow interfering.
