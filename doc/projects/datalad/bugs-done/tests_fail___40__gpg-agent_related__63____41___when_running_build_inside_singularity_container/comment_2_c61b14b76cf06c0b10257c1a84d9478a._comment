Tried to reproduce it here running in a directory with the same lenth, but
no failures. It could have to do with the old version of gpg-agent.

(I don't see how gpg inside the container could talk to gpg-agent outside
the container at all, unless the container shares a filesystem, and even
then, gpg inside the container is being run with a nonstandard home
directory, so it will not try to talk to a gpg-agent socket in the usual
home directory.)

I have a patch that makes the path to the socket file relative, but can't
verify if it will fix the problem. I've applied it anyway.
