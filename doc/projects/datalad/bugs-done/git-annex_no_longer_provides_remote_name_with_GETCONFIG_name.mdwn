### Please describe the problem.

A special remote implementation that needs to look up further config based on the remote name no longer works, because a recent change prevents `GETCONFIG name` to return the remote name while `git annex initremote` is driving the special remote implementation.


### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?

It used to work with 7.20191230 and no longer does with 8.20200226, test on Debian and Ubuntu.

### Please provide any additional information below.

### Have you had any luck using git-annex before? (Sometimes we get tired of reading bug reports all day and a lil' positive end note does wonders)

There is no day that ends without me being grateful for git-annex ;-)
