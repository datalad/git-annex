These strange options forcing use of unusual ssh sockets stick out.

You don't indicate what kind of remote is being enabled. --debug output
is often useful.

The travis log is kind of enormous to take in, when all I want to know is
the type of the remote, and maybe a --debug output. Grepping it seemed
to suggest that target2 might be a regular git remote that has been fed
into initremote, but I'm not sure?
