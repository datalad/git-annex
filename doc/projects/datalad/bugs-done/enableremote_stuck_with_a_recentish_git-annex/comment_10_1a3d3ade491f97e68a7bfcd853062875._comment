I am sorry! I rushed pasting I guess and didn't spot that pasted the wrong one.  Instead of `8.20200226+git16-ge156a2b74-1~ndall+1` I meant `7.20190819+git2-g908476a9b-1~ndall+1` which [we have in neurodebian ATM](http://neuro.debian.net/pkgs/git-annex-standalone.html?highlight=standalone). `8.20200226+git16-ge156a2b74-1~ndall+1`  is a bad one!
