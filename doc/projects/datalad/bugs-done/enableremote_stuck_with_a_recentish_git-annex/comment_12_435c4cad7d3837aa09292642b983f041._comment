It seems to me that the process tree you pasted there comes from 
the host where git-annex is running, and not the host that it sshes
to in order to run git-annex-shell.

What I was suggesting is, if ssh $host git-annex-shell seems to be hanging,
it then makes sense to go look at $host and see if git-annex-shell is
running there, or has already run there (eg looking at
the ssh log). That bisects the problem space to one side or the other.
