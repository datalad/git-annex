Re ControlPersist=yes, git-annex runs ssh -O stop on a socket file on exit,
unless some other git-annex process is also using that socket. So they don't
hangaround stale. By passing options to make ssh use other sockets, 
you bypass that.

I do see in https://github.com/datalad/datalad/pull/4265
that you seem to have reproduced the hang without running git-annex at all?
Is that right? Seems to say not a git-annex bug. Perhaps some innocuous
change in behavior by git-annex, that tickles whatever the real problem is.
