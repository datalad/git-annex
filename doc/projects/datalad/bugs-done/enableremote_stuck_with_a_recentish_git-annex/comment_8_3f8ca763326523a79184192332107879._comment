> What git-annex version is it that does not exhibit the problem?

I know for sure that `8.20200226+git16-ge156a2b74-1~ndall+1` doesn't -- that is the one we are still distributing in neurodebian. In the past we tested other intermediate versions (like  7.20191114+git43-ge29663773) which also didn't exhibit it AT THAT TIME (different datalad, and possibly different git which gets bundled).

I will try to do that later.
