Since this is a regular git remote, all enableremote
does is the usual uuid probing. And that's where it hangs,
sshing to the remote to run git-annex-shell configlist.

One thing I notice is that you went to some trouble to pass 
with -c annex-ssh-options for target1. I assume for some important reason,
probably having to do with making ssh work in this environment.
But this remote is target2, so it doesn't use those options when it sshes
to it.
