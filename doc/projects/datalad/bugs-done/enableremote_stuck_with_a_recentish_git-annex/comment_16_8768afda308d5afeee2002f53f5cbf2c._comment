overall - yes. It still might be just our \"Runner\" issue.  I am not 100% sure in that since a reimplementation (WitlessRunner, used now in many places of the master version) which shouldn't have similar drawbacks, and should not stall -- it did stall as well and we didn't dig yet deeper.  Another \"anecdotal\" observation was that I saw the \"python -m nose\" which runs our tests to not exit cleanly, waiting for some process to be done, or until I Ctrl-C it... didn't analyze that situation either.
I will try to find some time to dig into this deeper and/or bisect (isn't easy/fun since didn't manage to reproduce locally yet).  Thank you for the details and comments about sockets -- I am yet to fully analyze that situation as well.  I just know that I do have some hanging around and they might have been initiated by a git-annex process which we start pointing to some not-yet initiated socket.
