Neither git rev 6316072f0 nor 86b18966f is present in my git-annex git repo,
which makes it kind of hard to look at the diff between whatever versions
of git-annex you're running. Are you building out of a patched git
repository?

My guess is [[!commit bea0ad220a68138dc0a43d0c86bb2353ecf92d2c]]
since it involves both directory reading and unsafeInterleaveIO.

Indeed, it looks like that could defer a readDirStream due to
unsafeInterleaveIO to outside the open/close bracket. And I suppose reading
from a closed file handle might conceivably segfault.

Looks like that would affect bare repositories, or using --all.
I don't think it would affect those commands in a non-bare repository.
Ah, I see youre whereis is indeed in a bare repository, and your drop
used --all, so my analysis seems right.

Fixed by backing out the problematic part of the commit.
