> Is the test suite running as root? Looks like probably yes. 

FWIW, it is a `runner` user  [ref](https://github.com/datalad/git-annex/pull/76/checks?check_run_id=3486443350#step:8:1) (did in a temp [PR](https://github.com/datalad/git-annex/pull/76)) who is not `root` but is part of the `admin` group thus with super privileges indeed (that is why I guess we can also use `hdiutil` directly to mount that crippled FS).
