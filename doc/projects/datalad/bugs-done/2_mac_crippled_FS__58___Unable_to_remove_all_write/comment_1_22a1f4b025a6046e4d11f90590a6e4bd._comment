Seems that mounting that way on OSX results in a FS where files are always mode
777 and the permissions cannot be changed.

When I tried using git-annex on such a FS, I saw:

	datalads-imac:x joey$ git annex init
	init
	  Detected a filesystem without fifo support.
	
	  Disabling ssh connection caching.
	
	  Filesystem allows writing to files whose write bit is not set.
	
	  Detected a crippled filesystem.

And it skips the new permissions check when on a crippled filesystem.

But in that that test run, it seems it is failing to detect a crippled
filesystem. Both because of the failure and also the test suite does
not even run the "v8 unlocked" tests when it detects a crippled filesystem.

Is the test suite running as root? Looks like probably yes. Running as
root prevents detecting the issue that made it use a crippled FS above. And it
seems that, when a FAT fs is mounted on OSX that way, symlinks actually work
(!!!) so the other crippled FS tests also don't notice a problem.

So, the fix should be for init to also test if it can remove the write
bits from a file, and it should try that test even when root.
