The problem is that withKeyOptions' runbranchkeys finds keys,
and matchLockStatus with a MatchingKey is always False. The former would
need to check if the file in the branch is unlocked or not and add that to
the data for use by the latter.

Looks like it can be done without adding any additional overhead,
but currently catKey reads the git ref and uses parseLinkTargetOrPointer
which handles both indiscriminitely, so that would also need to be changed.

This goes beyond find, the same basic problem is that
`git-annex whereis --unlocked --all` does not display anything,
while without the --unlocked it does. Probably it should not be allowed
to combine --unlocked and --locked with --all or --key, because that does
not actually make any sense. Also --all with
--include/--exclude/--want-get/--want-drop/--mimetype/--mimeencoding.
