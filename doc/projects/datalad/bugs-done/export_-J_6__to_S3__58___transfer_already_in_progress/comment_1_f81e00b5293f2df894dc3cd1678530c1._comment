Answer first: Re-running export will skip over things that it knows
it already exported before, so should be efficient.

Yes, it seems this is the same as the old issue where 2 files with the same
key being sent to a remote concurrently failed like this. Fixed back then by
skipping the second, redundant transfer. But in this case, since there are
2 files on the remote, the data needs to be sent twice. So it probably just
shouldn't guard against redundant transfers when exporting. Or if it does,
it should use the ExportLocation, not the Key as what coulds as redundant..
I will have to look at this later though.
