Tried going back to c04b2af3e1a8316e7cf640046ad0aa68826650ed,
which is before the separation of perform and cleanup stages.
The same code was in onlyActionOn back then. And the test case does not
crash.

So, that gives a good commit to start a bisection. Which will probably
find the bug was introduced in the separation of perform and cleanup stages,
because that added a lot of STM complexity.

(Have to cherry-pick 018b5b81736a321f3eb9762a2afb7124e19dbdf9
onto those old commits to make them build with current libraries.)
