Reproduced.

After building git-annex with the DebugLocks flag, I got this:

	debugLocks, called at ./Annex/Transfer.hs:248:18 in main:Annex.Transfer
	debugLocks, called at ./CmdLine/Action.hs:263:26 in main:CmdLine.Action

Which points to pickRemote and ensureOnlyActionOn. But pickRemote
does no STM actions when there's only 1 remote, so it must really be
the latter.

Also, I notice that when 5 files to get are provided, it crashes, but with
less than 5, it succeeds. 
Even this trivial case crashes: `git annex get -J1 1 2`
