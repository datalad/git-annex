Actually, the format of pointer files allows
additional content to be present after the key and a newline.

That is to allow for future expansion. Note that git-lfs does the same and
IIRC puts something additional in there, perhaps including a comment like
"This file's content is not present; this is only a pointer."

So, appending to the link file keeps it a working link,
 just a link with more crap at the end:

	joey@darkstar:/tmp/aaaa>echo "more crap" >> g
	joey@darkstar:/tmp/aaaa>cat g
	/annex/objects/SHA256E-s14135--d1e433edea357dde79276fcfd63bacb93f2c2b4bf869ab976ee83a66e5506e16
	more crap
	joey@darkstar:/tmp/aaaa>git-annex whereis g
	whereis g (1 copy)
	  	00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001 -- web
	
	  web: http://google.com/
	ok

So how is this data loss? The annexed content is still available;
git-annex get will still work. The content you appended to 
the link file didn't go where you intended it to, but it is checked
into git too.

If git-annex warned about this when smudging a file, it would still 
get added to git; it can't prevent that. And the warning would mess
with any intentional use of this.
