If it errored, git would ignore the failure and still add the file
content to git.

One thing that could be done is to come up with some kind of format for the
lines after the annex link in the pointer file, to be used in whatever
future expansion might happen. Then it could warn if there is data there
not matching that format. And then add the file to the annex, to at least
keep that data out of the git repository.
