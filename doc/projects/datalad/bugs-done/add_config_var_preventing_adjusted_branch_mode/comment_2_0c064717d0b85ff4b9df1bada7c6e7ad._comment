It might be worth preventing `git-annex init` when in an existing, already
initalized repo from entering an adjusted branch. But re-running `git-annex
init` generally re-does initialization, except for generating a new UUID
and description. If a repo has been moved to a crippled filesystem,
I think it would be reasonable for a user to expect re-running git-annex
init will react to that. (Which can also involve setting annex.pidlock or
disabling annex.sshcaching.)
