git-annex does not enter adjusted branch mode except on `git-annex
init` or when you explcitly tell it to. The only exception to this that I
can find is that upgrading from a v5 repository that was in direct mode
will enter an adjusted branch.

Switching back from an adjusted branch to master is a simple `git
checkout`.

These two facts do not argue for a separate config setting IMHO.
