here my \"concern\" was freeze/thawing procedure. I am yet to get to the bottom of \"variance\" of how differently different ACL paths behave (some exploration from this friday is [here](https://github.com/dbic/handbook/issues/20)). And what I am afraid is that at some point, something would \"trigger\" git-annex to decide that path here is crippled now -- go to adjusted branches mode. If you say it cannot happen, it is ok - I will become more brave ;-)
