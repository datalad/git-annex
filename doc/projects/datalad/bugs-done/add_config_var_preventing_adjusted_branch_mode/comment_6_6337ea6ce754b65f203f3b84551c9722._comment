Note that this bug is closed, and it would need to be moved out of
this archive to be reopened.

Anyway, I agree that if the freeze/thaw hook is configured, but fails,
it would make sense for crippled filesystem probing to tell the user to
fix their configuration, and abort initialization, rather than
unnecessarily entering an adjusted branch. I have implemented that now.

As far as situations where the hook is configured at first but later
is not configured, `git-annex fsck` re-runs the hook to freeze content.
So that is not dissimilar from other situations where permissions prevent 
proper freezing, which fsck also fixes.
