Ok, figured it out.. reverseAdjustedTree uses a `propchanges`
function that looks at the diff from adjusted branch to basis,
and substitutes the new sha for the old one. So that's
how the sha get changed.

My analysis was otherwise correct, I think. And your patch is fine, now
that I understand that. Applying it as-is.
