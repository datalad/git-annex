FWIW, we actually only recently did the opposite -- [added inode](https://github.com/datalad/datalad/pull/5276) into consideration on our (datalad end) while monitoring for changes to `.git/config` files: `git` seems to rewrite those files (so inode changes)  which provided us a nice consistent indication and avoided crippled systems workarounds. Otherwise we were hitting all kinds of weird/hard to debug corner cases.
