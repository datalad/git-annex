Reproduced on fat with the current version. (You didn't say what your
filesystem was however.)

Seems quite possibly related to the recent change in
[[!commit 73df633a6215faa093e4a7524c6d328aa988aed1]]. Since that 
made the inode not be considered when importing, and since FAT has very
low resolution timestamps (1s), repeated modifications of a file that don't
change its size could not be noticed when repeatedly importing.

But hmm, the test suite already guards against such a thing by making sure,
when writing a new value to a file, that the modification time is different
than before.
