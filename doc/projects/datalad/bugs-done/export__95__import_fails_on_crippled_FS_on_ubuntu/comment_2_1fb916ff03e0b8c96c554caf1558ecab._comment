Confirmed that a sleep at the right place in the test suite avoids the
failure. Unsure yet why the test suite's existing mtime managing didn't manage
to. 

I do think this should be fixed in the test suite; it's acceptable
that, if using a FS like FAT that doesn't support high-rest mtimes,
git-annex not deal with high-frequency modifications. The same behavior
could already have happened on FAT when it was including the inode,
if the modifications were done w/o overwriting changing the inode.
