The diff shows `git annex whereis` used to send CLAIMURL to the external,
and no longer does.

Reproduction recipe using git-annex-remote-ipfs:

	git annex initremote ipfs type=external externaltype=ipfs encryption=none
	date > somefile
	git annex add somefile
	git annex addurl --debug --relaxed ipfs:dummy --file somefile

Which results in `git annex whereis somefile` saying it's present in ipfs,
but not listing the ipfs url for it. And again, whereis does not sent
CLAIMURL.

And, in log.web, I see why:

	+1513013502.312530881s 1 ipfs:dummy

That is not an OtherDownloader url, it's lacking the ":" prefix.

This seems to be particular to the addurl --relaxed --file code path;
letting addurl add a new file does result in an OtherDownloader url
being recorded.

I guess the reason the test suite then fails is, the url it removes is not
the one git-annex recorded, and so git-annex still thinks it's at the wrongly
recorded url, and so dropping succeeds.
