ok, tested with 6.20171208+gitg01f78e877-1~ndall+1 -- --fast mode issue is indeed resolved.  Thanks!
Failing tests now only relate to our special remote (datalad-archives) which interfaces urls, so I thought it might relate... I will try to distill more info tomorrow unless you beat me to it figuring out where that regression could be (upon quick look didn't spot any yt: anywhere, so probably another issue)
