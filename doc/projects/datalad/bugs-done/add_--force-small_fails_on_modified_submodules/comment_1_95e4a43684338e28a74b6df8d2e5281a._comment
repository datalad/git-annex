Really well done, thank you. Applied both.

About the only thing I have to add is, I wonder if it would be better for 
--force-small to just temporarily disable the clean filter and always
use git add. Seems that might be less likely to run into this kind of
breakage. OTOH, it looks like you've found all the possible bugs in it
already... So I suppose I'll wait until the next bug is found in it to
think about doing that. ;-)
