passing public=yes to initremote does not make git-annex use anonymous http
to access a S3 remote, if you have S3 credentials in the environment. I
don't remember if I tried to repro it w/o S3 credentials or not, but either
way the bug is not clear about how git-annex was trying to access the
remote when it failed.
