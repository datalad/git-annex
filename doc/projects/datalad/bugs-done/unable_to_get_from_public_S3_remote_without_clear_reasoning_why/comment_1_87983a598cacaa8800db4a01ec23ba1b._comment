It kind of looks like this S3 remote is being used without login
credentials. That's not clear, because you could have environment variables
set or creds cached, or not.

Since it's "public: yes", it would fall back to the public url code path to
get the file when there are no creds.

There are a lot of ways that could fail. Eg, perhaps no publicurl has been
configured for the remote. But in that case (and many other cases),
an exception should be thrown and displayed.

I think I need to know how to reproduce this to get any further.
