Not sure what you meant by \"need to know how to reproduce this to get any further\" since a full example was provided, and to reproduce \"this\" problem, commands could have been cut/paste'ed.
Now, with all the changes to git-annex, and that dataset (may be next time I would do some kind of fast-export on them or host a dedicated clone), it would indeed be hard if not impossible to reproduce, and I do not observe it with git annex `7.20200219+git135-g34d726cba-1~ndall+1` so I will mark it as done
