You should always enable pidlock on NFS.

AFAIK, there has been no particular change to git-annex that prevents .nfs
files from causing problems when git-annex uses posix file locking.
There might have been some change in the behavior of a nfs server, eg
it might delete the .nfs file *eventually*, but only after git-annex
has tried, and failed, to delete the non-empty key directory. Seems like
the kind of thing that network latency etc could make nondeterministic.

There are already at least two other open bug reports wishing that
git-annex somehow discover when a repo is on NFS and enable pidlock.
<https://git-annex.branchable.com/bugs/huge_multiple_copies_of___39__.nfs__42____39___and___39__.panfs__42____39___being_created/>
<https://git-annex.branchable.com/bugs/git-annex__58___content_is_locked__while_trying_to_move_under_NFS_and_pidlock/>

(The second of those is really about something else, but it's been waiting
on a fix being confirmed for 3 years, so the only useful part of it is I
guess the last message in the thread, which discusses the difficulty of
detecting NFS.)

So I'm inclined to merge this bug report with the first of those.
