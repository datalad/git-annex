Sure, some minor change in git-annex could tickle non-deterministic
behavior, eg something to do with timing of when it deletes the file 
vs the later closing of the file that drops the lock.

That regression made git-annex init fail when NFS doesn't have posix lock
support enabled. It can detect that, and enables pidlock, but it can't
detect NFS when it is pretending to support posix locks.
