git-annex does not these days treat lack of of hard link support as a crippled
filesystem. It just falls back to copying files where it would make hard
links.

encfs is coming up crippled because it ignores lack of write bits on files;
writing to a mode 444 file on an encfs filesystem by the owner of the file
is allowed. 

That breaks an important safeguard that git-annex relies on;
for example this would work in a non-direct mode repository on an encfs
filesystem, even though file permissions don't allow writing to annexed
file contents:

	joey@darkstar:/tmp/encfs/d> echo corrupt > bar

So, you're really better off using direct mode on encfs.

encfs has tons of other problems that make it not work well with
git-annex, and generally insecure. I heartily recommend you reconsider
using it.
