/etc/xdg/autostart/git-annex.desktop is part of the git-annex Debian
package, but it's a conffile, so if dpkg reinstalls it after it was deleted
that would be a dpkg bug. Anyway, it's not a file written by git-annex
except during make install with no PREFIX.

I'm going to close this as it's very old and my earlier comment seems
valid.
