This may depend on the version of gpg in use. With latest version, I see:

	 374404 ?        Ss     0:00 gpg-agent --homedir /home/joey/src/git-annex/.t/tmprepo85/../gpgtmp/1 --use-standard-socket --daemon
	 374411 ?        Ss     0:01 gpg-agent --homedir /home/joey/src/git-annex/.t/tmprepo85/../gpgtmp/2 --use-standard-socket --daemon

12 of these build up by the end of the test suite. But here when the test suite
exits, they all terminate.

Presumably they have a deleted file they're holding open, which causes NFS to
break in the ususal NFS way. Here they have an inotify handle, and some kind of
socket. Based on the .nfs filename, which I think usually includes the name of
the deleted file but here does not, I suspect it might be for the directory
itself, and so due to the inotify handle.

Ah, I think I see.. When I delete the directory, gpg-agent notices
and exits.

`gpgconf --kill all` can be used to stop them, so I've made the test
suide do that after using gpg.
