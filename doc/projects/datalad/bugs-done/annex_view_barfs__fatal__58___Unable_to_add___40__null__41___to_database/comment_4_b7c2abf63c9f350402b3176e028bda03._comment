It's caused by git submodules with names starting with dots. Not at all
related to the recent null pointer dereference bug in git-annex.

The .heudiconv/ directory is a submodule and git ls-files lists it; the view
generation code assumes it's a dotfile and asks git to hash it.

	joey@darkstar:~/tmp/1038_hyperface.x>git hash-object -w --stdin-paths --no-filters
	.heudiconv
	fatal: Unable to add (null) to database

Views only include dotfiles to make .gitattributes etc work, and they don't
include submodules normally, but they do include dot-dirs too; indeed I see
this repository uses that with a .datalad/ that gets included in the view.
Perhaps .heudiconv/ is a similar dot-dir. Seems that such submodule
dot-dirs ought to be included in the view.
