That change would lead to buggy behavior, because git-annex would then not
stage the journal files, and the optimisation prevents it reading the
journal files, so it would operate with out of date information.

The right fix, I think is to avoid making a commit, and instead only stage
the journal files into the annex index. 

But probably only when annex.alwayscommit=false and still commit when it's
true, because leaving staged changes in the annex index without
committing them risks git gc deleting the objects used, which is a
documented gotcha with annex.alwayscommit=false but not something users
should otherwise need to worry about.
