Update: Completed and merged!

Current list of items that need to be fixed before this is mergeable:

- (fixed) When there is a transition in one of the remote git-annex branches
  that has not yet been applied to the local or other git-annex branches.
  Transitions are not handled.
- (fixed) `git-annex log` runs git log on the git-annex branch, and so
  it will not be able to show information coming from the other, not yet
  merged branches. Fixed by making it error out in that situation.
- (fixed) Annex.Branch.files only looks at files in the git-annex branch and not
  unmerged branches. This affects git-annex info output when displaying
  info for a remote or a uuid. Fixed by making info display "not available"
  in that situation. Not ideal, it is a small difference in output compared
  to when the repository is not read-only.
- (fixed) Annex.Branch.hs.overBranchFileContents ditto. Affects --all and
  also importfeed (but importfeed cannot work in a read-only repo
  anyway). Fixed by making --all throw an error when there are unmerged
  branches.
- (fixed) CmdLine.Seek.seekFilteredKeys when precaching location logs.
  Note use of Annex.Branch.fullname. Fixed by avoiding precaching
  when there are unmerged git-annex branches. This fix will make some
  things slower in a read-only repo.
- (skip) Database.ContentIdentifier.needsUpdateFromLog and updateFromLog access
  the branch manually and would not see unmerged branches. But updateFromLog
  writes to the db so won't run in a readonly repo anyway, and so it seems
  this can be skipped.
- (skip) `--in=repository@{date}` uses loggedLocationsHistorical which uses
  Annex.Branch.getHistorical, which does not look at unmerged branches.
  But perhaps this is ok.. This uses the reflog, so when used to query
  eg files that were present in the past, it means ones that the local
  git-annex branch thought were present; other git-annex branches
  may have had a different opinion but it will not show those.
  And another way to look at it, the result for this will be the same
  before and after merging those branches.
