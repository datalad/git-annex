@jkniiv that may somehow be windows-specific, if opening a sqlite database
on windows in order to only query it needs write access.

I did try this on linux with an unlocked file and it did not crash, but the
file was already present in the database. I also tried with the keysdb
deleted, and it still worked. I'm sure that there are situations though
where the database is not updated where it will try to populate it before
querying it, which will fail when it cannot write.

It would be worth filing new bug reports for such issues. Although
when write access is unavoidable, I might just have to close them.
