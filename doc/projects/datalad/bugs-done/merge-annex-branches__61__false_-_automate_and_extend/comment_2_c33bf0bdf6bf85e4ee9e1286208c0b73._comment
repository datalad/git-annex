I have not been able to reproduce the 
`git -c annex.merge-annex-branches=false annex wanted here`
problem. You apparently have annex.pidlock set since
"locktmp" is used when doing pid locks, but despite setting that and having
an unmerged remote git-annex branch, this is as close as I can get:

	nobody@darkstar:/tmp/yyy$ git-annex wanted here
	git-annex: /tmp/yyy/.git/annex: openTempFile template locktmp: permission denied (Permission denied)
	wanted: 1 failed
	nobody@darkstar:/tmp/yyy$ git -c annex.merge-annex-branches=false annex wanted here

	nobody@darkstar:/tmp/yyy$

Anyway, this is an entirely different problem and should be in its own bug
report, once you determine how to reproduce it..
