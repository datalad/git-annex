The next release is going to escape and quote filenames that contain
special characters similarly to how git does. (But json will not be affected due
to already being escaped.)

This will affect filenames output in error messages. So if you are
parsing error messages or non-json output with filenames that contain
characters that need to be escaped, you will need to deal with the
change.

See [[todo/terminal_escapes_in_filenames]] for the full details of this
change.

One thing I noticed about your example is that git-annex add doesn't display
that particular filename the same as git add does:

	joey@darkstar:~/tmp/xxx>git-annex add 'gl\orious'
	git-annex: "gl\\orious" not found
	joey@darkstar:~/tmp/xxx>git add 'gl\orious'
	fatal: pathspec 'gl\orious' did not match any files

But, that is an inconsistency in git itself. More commonly it uses the same
display as git-annex for this filename:

	joey@darkstar:~/tmp/xxx>touch 'gl\orious'
	joey@darkstar:~/tmp/xxx>git add 'gl\orious'
	joey@darkstar:~/tmp/xxx>git diff --cached
	diff --git "a/gl\\orious" "b/gl\\orious"
	new file mode 100644
	index 0000000..e69de29

So I don't think there's a problem with git-annex's behavior here. With
that said, we can talk about adding something to make back-compatability
easy for you, or whatever. An config like core.quotePath but that also
affects special characters, not just unicode, for example.
