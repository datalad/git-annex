[[todo/api_for_telling_when_nonexistant_or_non_git_files_passed]] is
implemented now.

In datalad, all you should need to do now is check for a json object with
`errorid:"FileNotFound"` and the `file` field is the name of the file.

Note that the parser for error messages like "did not match any file(s)
known to git" from `git ls-files --error-unmatch` will still be needed in
datalad.

I'm going to leave this open as a git-annex release blocker until the
necessary changes get made to datalad.
