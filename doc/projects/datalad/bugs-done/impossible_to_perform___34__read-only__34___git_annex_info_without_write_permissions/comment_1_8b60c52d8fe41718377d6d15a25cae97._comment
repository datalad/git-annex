The mergedrefs directory is used while building the commit to merge
git-annex branches. So even if it was written someplace else, that commit
would fail.

I think this may be happening even when there are no
git-annex refs to merge in, due to the transition code
in Annex.Branch.updateTo that temporarily calls addMergedRefs
in the "null tomerge" case. That was added in 2016, and is flagged as able
to be safely removed. I've removed it.

However, when there actually is a git-annex branch to merge, if a
hypothetical readonly mode avoided doing so, it would necessarily see a
different state of the git-annex branch than would be seen in non-readonly
mode. That behavior difference could be fairly confusing potentially..
