Hmm, it seems to me that when git-annex runs git diff, it passes
--no-ext-diff, which ought to disable any external diff drivers.

Ah, so this is really about the .gitattributes textconv,
which enables the same thing in a different way that 
the other option doesn't disable. 
Ok, I'll add --no-textconv as well.
