I can certianly reproduce this if I manually get the keys database
into a state where it has the wrong inode recorded for the object file.

I have not found a way to make that happen using git-annex, but I'm
guessing it might involve annex.thin being set, and almost certianly
involves unlocked files. Some sequence of events is happening in
the git repo that later prevents getting content from it, even though
the content is still there.

It kind of looks like Command.Lock might neglect to update the keys
database when it repopulates the annex object from an unmodified associated
file in the case where it was hard linked to another, unlocked file and so
got modified. I have not quite managed to make that reproduce it though.

But that's just guessing and the real situation could be something
different. Someone needs to figure out how to reproduce this,
until then I'm probably stuck.

(Enough other things could break due to this kind of database inconsistency
that simply removing the check when transferring the file would only paper
over the problem.)
