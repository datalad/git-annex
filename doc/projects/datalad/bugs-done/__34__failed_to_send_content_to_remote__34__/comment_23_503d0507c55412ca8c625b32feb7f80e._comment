There are probably multiple causes. v8 upgrade does seem likely to be the
main one, but I see that adswa seems to have found a way to reproduce it from
scratch:
<https://github.com/datalad/datalad/issues/5750#issuecomment-888819347>
It's looking like perhaps inode instability in their case, due to use
of a networked filesystem in a cluster.

I have done some detailed auditing, and I'm pretty sure git-annex doesn't
just forget to record the inode in some case. Well, except for potentially
one case involving git-annex lock and annex.thin, which I fixed but was not
able to actually quite get to reproduce the problem. 

(I did find a some potential races, that would cause other problems but not
this one, so the auditing was good for something..)
