I don't think a strace will tell me anything now.

Is this the same repository that this issue was regarding?
<https://github.com/datalad/datalad/issues/5613>
If not, that does seem like the same problem so perhaps we could learn
something from that repository.

Was this repository upgraded from git-annex repository format 7 to 8?
If so, I see one way this could have happened. That upgrade regenerates
the keys db, but does not add inode caches for annex objects.
