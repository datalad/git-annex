Hm, the mtime of the target of `software_releases/openbsd/68/amd64/install68.img` is later than the time of my last comment:

I can't imagine what would have touched it in the meantime, but there it is. So, I suspect your theory about the mtime changing is right. (I double-checked that git annex fsck is still happy with the file today.)

Next time I see this behaviour, I'll try running your updated code to confirm the cause, and also try to figure out what's touching the file.
