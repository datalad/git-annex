I've taken a close look at the error handling in the relevant code path.
Normally when there's an exception it gets displayed. It is possible
for the transfer to fail without displaying anything and without throwing an
exception. When I synthesize such a failure, I see the same
output you described.

One way that could happen is if git-annex thinks the file got
modified while it was being sent. If the file was unlocked, and was touched
by something else while the copy was running, it would be enough to make
git-annex think that, even though the content is still good. I've made
it display a reason for the failure in that case.

The only other way I found was if the hash fails to verify, which seems
already ruled out in your case, but it did result in the same hard to understand
output, so I've fixed that too.

It would be good to know if one of these changes has fixed it for you.
The autobuild for linux should be updated within an hour.
While the scenario with the file having been touched seems unlikely to
happen repeatedly with different files, it does otherwise match your
circumstances and seems like the most likely fit.
