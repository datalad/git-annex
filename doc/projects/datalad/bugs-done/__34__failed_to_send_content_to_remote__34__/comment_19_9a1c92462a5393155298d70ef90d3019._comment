I've made it fall back to checking the file's content when the inode cache
is somehow stale. I expect this will solve the problem. But, I would still
like to know how to reproduce the problem, because if something is making
the inode cache go stale, this fallback check will need to hash the file,
which could make git-annex significantly more expensive.
