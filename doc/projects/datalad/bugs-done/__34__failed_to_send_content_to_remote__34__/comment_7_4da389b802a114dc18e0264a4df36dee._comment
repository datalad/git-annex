I'm having the same problem with the latest git-annex from Debian bullseye (`8.20210223-2`). I have a flaky hardware clock on this computer, which NTP regularly adjusts by a few seconds (!):

    jui 17 21:56:27 curie ntpd[1042]: adjusting local clock by -2.525655s
    jui 17 21:57:30 curie ntpd[1042]: adjusting local clock by -2.546923s
    jui 17 22:01:51 curie ntpd[1042]: adjusting local clock by -2.537140s

so maybe that's what's going on? i understand that having a working clock is kind of ... expected of computers nowadays (!) but maybe that could be the source of this problem...
