@mih so the new version's output confirms my suspicion that git-annex
sees a change in the stat information of the file (mtime, size, inode)
from before it started the transfer to when it finished.

I could imagine eg, that somehow the filesystem is not preserving stable
inode numbers, and so the inode might appear different, without anything
having actually changed.

It also seems possible that git-annex might somehow fail to stat the file
either before or afterwards. In either case that would result in the same
message. Maybe there's some way that the file gets deleted at the same time
it's being transferred. Maybe the stat call fails for some other reason.

A strace of git-annex seems like the next step, if you can reproduce this
somewhat reliably. I suggest a `strace -v`, which will display the full
results of the stat() calls. The stats of the object file done before
and after are the only part of the strace that we should need.
