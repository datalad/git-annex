I agree, fsck should notice and correct this problem. The current fix
papers over the problem it in a way that will prevent users noticing it.
Fsck being noisy about it will help avoid sweeping it under the rug and
forgetting about it. Implemented that.

The performance impact here is relatively small. Aside from
whenever this problem occurs, the extra checksumming will only happen when
files are unlocked and the object file is modified. So annex.thin
would need to be set and a file modified in a way that affects the object
file. Several other parts of git-annex also checksum in that situation;
that's a perf price you pay for using annex.thin. When this problem does
occur, it will only checksum the object file once, and then will get its
inode information cached.
