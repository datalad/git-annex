You grepped for stats of a file in `tmp` directory but those stats are not
relevant to this problem. Since you ran git-annex get, it should be statting
the annex object file in the remote repository, which I assume is another git
repo on the same computer. (Otherwise it would not be able to fail this way
AFAICS.) It's the stat of that file that's relevant.

I've added some debugging now, so --debug with a fresh git-annex build
should explain what's going on with the stats. 
Use -c annex.debugfilter=Annex.InodeSentinal,Annex.Content 
to limit debug output to the relevant ones.
