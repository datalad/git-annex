If it helps: I see a progress indicator go from 0% to 100% four times when I run the copy command. The \"failed to send content to remote\" messages appear after the second and fourth times.

Also, I was able to copy that reddit dataset file (from my original comment) to this remote (`elbow`) today. So I guess it is not a property of the particular file on the source repository?
