From the --deubg you provided, the important part is that rsync is
succeeding to copy the file, but then git-annex for some reason thinks it
failed, or has some other problem. Eg, if the annexed object was corrupt,
it could copy it with rsync and then fail to verify the copy.

Your git-annex version is a year out of date, so you should upgrade. The
code that is failing has definitely been changed a lot in the meantime,
though not that I can remember to fix a bug like this.
