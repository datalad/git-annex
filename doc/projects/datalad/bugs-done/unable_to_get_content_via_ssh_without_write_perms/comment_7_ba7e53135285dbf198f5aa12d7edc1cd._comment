I'm going to close this, since I was able to replicate and fix one of the
errors, and was not able to replicate the other one. If the other one
still happens, follow up with the output of the current version of
git-annex, as I've requested 3 times now.

There is a test case now that tests the same thing, too. It has passed
on all the builders. (Except windows. I've learned git-annex cannot support
readonly repos on Windows, because it has to be able to create lock files
there.)

(There are still situations where git-annex needs to write to a repo in order to
use it. The main one is if the it needs to upgrade the repo. I think
failing in that specific situation is ok, and it fails with an informative
error message IIRC. It's also possible there's some other situation of some
kind where the readonly repo is in a state where git-annex wants to write
to it, but if there is, I can fix it when the situation comes to light.)
