That issue I encountered using [reproducer](https://git.kitenet.net/index.cgi/git-annex.git/tree/doc/bugs/unable_to_get_content_via_ssh_without_write_perms/comment_5_9e4b82d27ddbb42d74f10a85635590e7._comment) (without ssh; sorry for broken markdown formatting, but can't edit a comment) still reproduces locally (no NFS) using originally reported 8.20210803+git133-ga7cf5abf3 if I reinstall that version, but it does not reproduce using recent 8.20210803+git167-g608593fec , so I guess it was addressed too.
