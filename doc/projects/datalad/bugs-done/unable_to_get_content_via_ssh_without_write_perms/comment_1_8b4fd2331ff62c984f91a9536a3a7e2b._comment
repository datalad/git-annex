This did used to work, see [[todo/read-only_removable_drives]] which ended
with it working in 2016.

There is a way to do it that's certian to work: Make a ssh key that logs
into the host as the user who owns the repository, and lock that ssh key
down to run git-annex-shell with `GIT_ANNEX_SHELL_READONLY=1
GIT_ANNEX_SHELL_LIMITED=1`

Still this should be investigated. Since one failure is certianly due to
the keys database update, it seems likely that's what's changed.
