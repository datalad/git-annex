keysdb error was a reversion in [[!commit f46e4c9b7c]], which reversed some
logic and made database reads be treated as database writes, so it failed
on permission denied, rather than the right behavior of returning
DbUnavailable when it cannot read or the database does not exist yet. 

Fixed that. It seems to work for me now, both get and drop, and over ssh or
direct access to the readonly repository.

I have not been able to reproduce the other error involving
opening a temp file. All I can tell from the message is that it's writing
to some file in .git/annex via a temp file in the same directory, but
I don't know what file it is trying to write. I've made a change that
will include more information in that error message. So either update
your build of git-annex, or find a better reproduction recipe for that..
