This error message is not specific to a particular file in the repository, so if
git-annex get outputs it, it doesn't help for the error message to be
wrapped up in json. The actual purpose of --json-error messages is being
able to correlate a failure to eg, get a particular file with an error
message related to that action. Not in avoiding all possible stderr.

The actual bug here is that it dumps git config to stderr at all.

----

The extra newlines are output to stdout, so not a problem WRT stderr.
