So, this bug is mistitled, it's not about locking, but about looking.

Or more clearly, something about file paths that end up pointing to a home directory.

	fatal: Not a git repository: '../../../home/bids/.git' git-annex-shell: Not a git-annex or gcrypt repository.

	Unable to run git-annex-shell on remote .

The second message used to be output by the code path warming up the ssh
connection to handle concurrency. That code path has since changed, and no
longer tries to run git-annex-shell there.

And, notice the "remote ." -- that means that 
`Git.repoDescribe (gitConfigRepo (remoteGitConfig gc))` produced "."

And the git-annex shell command was similarly passed a directory
of `Git.repoPath $ gitConfigRepo $ remoteGitConfig gc`

So, it was running "git-annex-shell ." which got converted to an absolute path by git-annex-shell
when CWD was $HOME, and then re-relevatized.

Clearly that code was pretty broken, apparently more than I knew at the time
I fixed it. I do think it's fixed though, by [[!commit 3dd43df9c2748df355314cd07b2bb8ebd30be69e]].
