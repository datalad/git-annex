This looks like a serious regression in 8.x. It is not an intentional part
of the annex.dotfiles change. I have confirmed the last 7.x release did not
have the behavior.

(Notice that annex.dotfiles is not used in the repo where the problem
occurs. The regression was probably introduced by the annex.dotfiles
changes, but the dotfile could just as well have been added by git-annex v5
with git-annex add --include-dotfiles and the result committed to git would
be the same.)

A simpler test case is to unlock the dotfile in the first repo, then
all that needs to be run in its clone is `git annex get`.
