Analysis: Command.Smudge.shouldAnnex was changed
in [[!commit 3cd375723658398a4b15ff8ec19e562ec4622488]] to check, for dotfiles,
if annex.dotfiles is set. If not, it always returns False, so the file
always gets added to git when it's smudged.

After getting a file, git-annex tells git to update its index, which
smudges the file. Of course, there are also plenty of other things that can
cause a file to be smudged.

Bad. Fix is very easy, luckily. It just needs to, rather than returning
False, checking if the file was annexed, same as is done for non-dotfiles.
