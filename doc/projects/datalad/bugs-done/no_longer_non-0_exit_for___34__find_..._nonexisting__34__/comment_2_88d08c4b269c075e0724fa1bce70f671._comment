Also, the docs for annex.skipunknown say that a command should exit nonzero
if all files in a directory are not checked into git, but it does not
behave that way either. It seems that it needs to propagate a nonzero exit
status of git-ls-files at least for that, if not for also the handling of
files that do not exist.
