I guess you expected annex.queuesize to be set to 1.
However, that would mean every single file that addurl adds
needs the whole git index file to be rewritten so other commands can
immediately know about it. Which could be very slow, which is why that is
not the default.

What you can do is use `git annex addurl --batch --json` and observe the
key that it reports it's added. Then pass that key into `git annex metadata --batch --json`
to add metadata to the key, which will work before the file ever gets
added to the git index, and much more efficiently than relying on the
index.

(Pretty sure this has came up before and that I suggested the same thing
then.)
