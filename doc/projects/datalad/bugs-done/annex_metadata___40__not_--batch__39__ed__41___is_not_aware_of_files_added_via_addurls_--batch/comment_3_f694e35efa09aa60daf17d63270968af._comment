Implemented annex.skipunknown git config, that will make it error out when
given a file that git doesn't know about.

Not default yet, will be in a couple of years.
[[todo/complete_annex.skipunknown_transition_in_2022]]

As to git-annex skipping non-annexed files, I'm leaning toward keeping it
the way it is, and it's not really the subject of this bug report, except
maybe that it's not entirely consistent with the annex.skipunknown
behavior for non-git files. If users complain about it, I'll consider it
again.
