For future reference, I was able to run the test suite by cloning datalad,
and settup up the virtualenv like in the README, except then running "pip
install ." in the datalad directory.

I reproduced the datalad test failure. Then I wrapped git-annex with a
script that logs the paramters it was run with. It seems the test is 
running git-annex addurl, not git-annex add at all. So maybe that commit
broke addurl?
