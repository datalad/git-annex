Just to note, the standalone build currently ends up being used for [many conda installs](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/git-annex/files), so any fixes for it would be great.

Is there a list somewhere of currently known issues affecting the standalone build but not the standard build?  This would be useful in helping people decide between a more recent standalone build or an older standard one.
