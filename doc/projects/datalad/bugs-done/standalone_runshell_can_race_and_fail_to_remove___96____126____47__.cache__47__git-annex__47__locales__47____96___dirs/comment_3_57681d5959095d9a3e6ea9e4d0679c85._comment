I thought you were mostly using git-annex-standalone.deb @yoh,
and that, I think sets `GIT_ANNEX_PACKAGE_INSTALL` which prevents doing
anything with locales.

It does a minumum amount of work every time to get the locales
available, which is necessary because the user might have deleted the cache
since a previous run. If the cached files are available, it does not do
anything expensive. Clearing the old cache, which is what happened to fail
here, needs to be done at some point, and only happens once per old cache
directory, so I see no way to improve performance of that.

Anyway, something needs to be done to make runshell's updating of this
stuff idempotent, clearly.
