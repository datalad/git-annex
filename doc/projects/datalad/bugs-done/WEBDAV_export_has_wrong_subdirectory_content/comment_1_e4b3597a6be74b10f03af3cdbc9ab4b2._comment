Unless this only happens on the one webdav server, my guess is
it involves the kind of weird way DAV handles collections.

In particular, the content is being written to a temp file,
which is in the webdav root, and then it runs:

	inLocation src $ moveContentM (B8.fromString newurl)

where src = the webdav root. It may be that ignores the path in newurl and
just puts it into the same collection.
