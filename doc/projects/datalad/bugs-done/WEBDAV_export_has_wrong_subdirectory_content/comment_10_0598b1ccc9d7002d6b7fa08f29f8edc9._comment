Sorry, forgot about that.

I `git mv`'ed a file from the root into a subdirectory, and re-exported. It fails:

DAV failure: Status {statusCode = 500, statusMessage = \"Internal Server Error\"} \"<html><body><h1>Server Error</h1></body></html>\" HTTP request: \"MOVE\" \"/dltest20/some%20space/git-annex-webdav-tmp-MD5E-s4--ba1f2511fc30423bdbb183fe33f3dd0f\"

On the server-side the file is removed from the root, but the target directory only has the tmp files.
