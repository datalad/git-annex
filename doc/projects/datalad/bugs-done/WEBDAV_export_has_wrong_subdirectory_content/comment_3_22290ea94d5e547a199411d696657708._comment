If the problem does involve moving between collections, it could
avoid the problem by storing the temp file into the subdirectory in the first
place, and only renaming it to its final name once transferred. 

I've implemented that and committed it along with this comment,
and it works tested against box.com again, can you try it with
the 4shared server?
