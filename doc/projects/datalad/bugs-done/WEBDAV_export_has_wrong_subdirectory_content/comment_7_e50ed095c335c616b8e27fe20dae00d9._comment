I think I see another way that the same webdav server misbehavior could
happen, since there is also a rename. When a file is in the top of the
repo, is exported to webdav, then is moved into a subdirectory, and the
export run again, it will rename it to avoid re-uploading.

mid, can you check if the 4shared server breaks in that situation?

(I notice there's a special case in that code path already for the box.com
webdav server (see [[!commit bf48ba4ef7aeb69d5efca7c04068ff7752f57f3f]])
which apparently also had problems with renames. Although as I noted
upthread, I didn't see the problem reported in this bug report when I
tested it against box.com.)
