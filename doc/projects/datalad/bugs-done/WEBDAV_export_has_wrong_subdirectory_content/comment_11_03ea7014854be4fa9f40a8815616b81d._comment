Ok, failed kind of like I expected, although I have to say the filenames
don't entirely make sense to me.
("git-annex-webdav-tmp" is not used in filenames when renaming an exported
file, only when storing it in the first place)

So what seems to make sense for git-annex to do when renaming an exported
file is: Try to rename, and if it fails, delete the source and the
destination -- since it has no idea what may have been left in either place
-- and then fall back to uploading the file again instead. I have
implemented that.
