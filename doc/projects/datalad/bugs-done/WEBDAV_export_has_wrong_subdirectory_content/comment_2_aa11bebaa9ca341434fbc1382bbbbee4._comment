Well, I tried with the box.com webdav server, and did not reproduce the
problem there; exported files went into the proper subdirectories.

I think there's some chance that the webdav server you're trying to use is
just broken in its handling of moving from one collection to another. 
Or perhaps the webdav spec can be interpreted multiple ways and this is
falling into an edge case.

Here's --debug of it working:

	export box.com sub/t
	[2021-03-12 14:29:33.044254918] getProps sub/t
	[2021-03-12 14:29:35.56315446] putContent git-annex-webdav-tmp-SHA256E-s3--98ea6e4f216f2fb4b69fff9b3a44842c38686ca685f3f55dc48c5d3fb1107be4
	[2021-03-12 14:29:37.751164566] delContent sub/t
	[2021-03-12 14:29:38.695664147] getProps sub
	[2021-03-12 14:29:40.638445948] moveContent git-annex-webdav-tmp-SHA256E-s3--98ea6e4f216f2fb4b69fff9b3a44842c38686ca685f3f55dc48c5d3fb1107be4 https://dav.box.com/dav/git-annex/sub/t

Does it look significantly different in your case?

We unfortunately haven't an easy way to get a HTTP trace, but this shows
effectively the api calls for the DAV libary, and the moveContent looks
like it would generate a http request like this:

	MOVE /git-annex-webdav-tmp-SHA256E-s3...
	Destination: https://dav.box.com/dav/git-annex/sub/t

Which seems fine, there are similar examples in the webdav spec
of moving from one directory to another.
