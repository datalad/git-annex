I've been thinking a bit more about `annex.dotfiles` in the context of
[this forum post][0].  It seems to me that annexed dotfiles can jump
to git in a way that's surprising and worth raising as a possible bug.

Say that I have repo with `annex.dotfiles=true` in the .git/config,
and I add some dotfiles to the annex.  Then, someone clones that repo
and goes into an adjusted state (either by running `git annex adjust
--unlock` or by being on a crippled file system).  In that clone,
calling `annex get` on any of the annexed dotfiles will lead to those
files being added to the index as regular files.  (Demo included
below.)

The above issue could be resolved by the user storing
`annex.dotfiles=true` in `git-annex:config.log`, but perhaps it'd be
feasible for git-annex to guard against already annexed dotfiles
migrating to git?

Thanks in advance.
