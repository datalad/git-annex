I don't think annex.freezecontent-command will affect writing this file
though.

This seems to be how to reproduce it:

	git config sharedRepository group
	git annex init

	-rw-rw-r-- 1 joey joey 137 Jul 12 09:53 .git/annex/index
	-rw-r--r-- 1 joey joey  41 Jul 12 09:53 .git/annex/index.lck

Not identical modes here, but with an older git-annex the index.lck is 664
not 644.

Also, for some reason git-annex init with that config set complains that
"Filesystem allows writing to files whose write bit is not set."
And enters an adjusted brach. The older git-annex didn't do that either.
