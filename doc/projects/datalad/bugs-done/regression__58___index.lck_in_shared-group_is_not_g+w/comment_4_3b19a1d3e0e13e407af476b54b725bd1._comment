The bug was making init set annex.crippledfilesystem,
and once that's set, git-annex avoids setting file
perms, so then it writes index.lck it leaves it at the default permissions.

That might or might not be a problem in some case (eg if some filesystem
was detected as crippled but still supported file permissions to a point
that write bits need to be added to support core.sharedRepository = group), but 
the reversion was fixed by fixing init's behavior. So, closing this.
