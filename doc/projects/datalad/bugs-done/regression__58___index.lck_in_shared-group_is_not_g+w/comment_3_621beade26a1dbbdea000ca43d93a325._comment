Fixed the problem with git-annex init's probing. 

Oh, that's odd, fixing that also fixed the index.lck permissions.

So, the actual cause of the permissions problem is init deciding to enter
an adjusted unlocked branch. Entering the branch after init does not result
in the problem though. So still need to track down what's happening there,
since it can enter the adjusted branch for other reasons.
