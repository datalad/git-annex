How do I produce such a repo, I thought that git-annex has fixed the 
problem that made it not include the S3 versioning information?
I don't want to see a lot of repos being created with that information
missing.

----

Anyway, the S3 version is is a red herring, the failure is actually
caused by the export db not getting populated from the git-annex branch
before some threads try to use it. Remote.Helper.ExportImport has a
updateexportdb that lets one thread update the db, but other threads
don't block waiting for it. Easily fixed.
