> How do I produce such a repo, I thought that git-annex has fixed the problem that made it not include the S3 versioning information? I don't want to see a lot of repos being created with that information missing.

Sorry if I was not clear.  Those repositories were produced in 2018 when available/used version of git annex was not yet \"fixed\".  Newer datasets, have .rmet files, e.g. just checked https://github.com/OpenNeuroDatasets/ds002596 (full of .rmet files in git-annex branch ;))

>  Easily fixed.

Thanks. FTR in 7.20200219-129-ge52034150
