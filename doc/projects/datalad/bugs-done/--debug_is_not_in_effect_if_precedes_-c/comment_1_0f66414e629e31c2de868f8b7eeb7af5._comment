-c uses adjustGitRepo which calls changeGitRepo, which
re-extracts the GitConfig. --debug uses changeGitConfig which 
sets annexDebug in the GitConfig, which does not survive the changeGitRepo.

There might be a broader problem here, as changeGitRepo is also
called by setConfig in many parts of the code. I think it narrowly
escapes being a problem, because by the time a command is started,
it's already enabled debug output, and so the GitConfig being reloaded
doesn't disable debugging.

Other calls to changeGitConfig could also be a problem, if followed by
an adjustGitRepo which loses those changes. There are only a few others,
look probably ok, but this would be an easy gotcha to hit later.

So changeGitConfig needs to make a config change that persists across
changeGitRepo.

Done.
