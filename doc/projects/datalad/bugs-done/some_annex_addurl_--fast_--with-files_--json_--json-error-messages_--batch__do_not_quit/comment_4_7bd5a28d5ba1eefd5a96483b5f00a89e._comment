the mystery is that to our knowledge we do close the stdin (and stdout) of [git-annex process right before](https://github.com/datalad/datalad/blob/master/datalad/cmd.py#L1339), so pipe should have not remained open, unless something else may be somehow keeps it open...  And I cannot reproduce the bug ATM neither locally or on smaug where I did prepare you the reproduced case!

Indeed though I agree that pretty much any timeout could not generally be \"sufficient\".  That is why we need to figure out what is happening/why some times batched processes do not quit.  Either the later \"reproducer\" was exactly the same situation as in the original reported (where it was a few out of 1000s of batched processes) -- I do not know.  may be there are multiple issues.
