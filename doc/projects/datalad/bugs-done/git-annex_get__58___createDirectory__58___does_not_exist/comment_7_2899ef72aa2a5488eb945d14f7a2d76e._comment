Agreed, what you show in the stackoverflow post can only be an OSX bug.

Using a relative path for the current repository does avoid using long
absolute paths, and also has a minor benefit of letting the repository be
moved while git-annex is running and it still accessing the right files.

Neither benefit applies to the paths to remotes. I think the only
reason relative paths are being used for them is that the same code
is used to operate on them as on the local repository.

I've made some changes that will make it use absolute paths when the
remote has an absolute path.
