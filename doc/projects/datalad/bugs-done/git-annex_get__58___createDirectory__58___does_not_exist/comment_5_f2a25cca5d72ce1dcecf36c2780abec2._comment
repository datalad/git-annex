I can't see how git-annex can work around this, unless someone finds an
explanation for the OS's behavior.

I think you've clearly shown it's not a git-annex bug, since other mkdir()
calls behave the same way. And that seems to point squarely at an OS bug.

(Unless .git/annex was itself a dangling symlink, then ls would be able to
list it, but mkdir would fail like that.)
