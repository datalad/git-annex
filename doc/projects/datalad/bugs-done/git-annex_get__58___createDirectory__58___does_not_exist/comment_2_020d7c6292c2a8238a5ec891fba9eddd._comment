Is the relative path actually valid? There may be some case involving
symlinks in the parent directories where the relative path could be wrong.
This part seems to suggest there are symlinks involved:

Of course, it's a bit surprising that a relative path is used when the path
is into an entirely different top-level directory. But without
understanding the problem I don't know if switching to using an absolute
path in that case would only happen to fix this case of the problem and not
the general case, whatever that is.
