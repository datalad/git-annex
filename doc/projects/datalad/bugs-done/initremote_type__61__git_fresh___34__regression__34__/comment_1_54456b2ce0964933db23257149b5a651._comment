the \"heart\" of the issue is that in initremote we provide URL which is without `/.git` suffix.   That used to work just fine and [our test](https://github.com/datalad/datalad/blob/HEAD/datalad/distribution/tests/test_siblings.py#L560) testing `git annex get` on the clone accomplished the mission.
