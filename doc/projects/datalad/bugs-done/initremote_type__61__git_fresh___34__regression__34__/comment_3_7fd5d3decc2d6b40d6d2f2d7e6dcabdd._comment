Thank you Joey!  I will try to gain better insight into our dance in that test of ours. I am also curious how it worked before that it doesn't work now.  FWIW with `datalad clone` we do try URL as is, and then also with `/.git` to make users' life easier and so they could just e.g. `datalad clone https://datasets.datalad.org`.
