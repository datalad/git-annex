Re detecting NFS, I'm not sure that ".nfs" files are always used for
deleted files by all NFS configurations. And, there are probably NFS
configurations that do properly support Posix locks, and others that
don't. So connecting a check for ".nfs" files with turning on
annex.pidlock seems problimatic.

If we had a good way to detect systems that don't support Posix locks,
annex.pidlock could be auto-enabled. But for some reason embedding a large
portion of a Posix test suite into git-annex does not fill me with joy.
