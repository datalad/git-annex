Using --json will have the same effect as --quiet in that commands have
to be made to not output to stdout in that mode. In the case of
downloading an url, git-annex usually uses wget, however when curl is
available in path, it uses it in quiet mode, because curl displays error
messages to stdout, whereas wget never displays error messages at all
when run in quiet mode.

So, by using --json, you're changing the command that git-annex uses to
download files from wget to curl.

But, the git-annex standalone build bundles both wget and curl, so
I'd expect that any certificates problem would affect both equally.
But I suppose wget may be better able to deal with the certs on this
system than curl, for whatever reason.

Bundling certs with git-annex seems wrong on multiple counts; it's
moving a large security boundary inside git-annex; it's lots of work;
there may be local policies on allowed certs that this would disallow.

Suggestion: Remove curl from the standalone build you're using, so
it will use the system-wide curl.
