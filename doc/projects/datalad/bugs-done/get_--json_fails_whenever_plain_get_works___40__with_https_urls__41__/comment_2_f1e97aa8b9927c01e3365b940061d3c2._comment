There is no guarantee that system would have curl installed,  e.g. I believe neither of debian docker images would have curl.  For neurodebian package I sure thing could just depend on curl.  But I am afraid those who might be using standalone git-annex in minimalistic environments would get surprised

FWIW -- removing curl from the bundled git-annex indeed helped
