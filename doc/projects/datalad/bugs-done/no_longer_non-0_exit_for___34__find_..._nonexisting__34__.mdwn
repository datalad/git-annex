### Please describe the problem.

Recent git-annex release [triggered a number of datalad test fails](https://github.com/datalad/datalad/issues/6492).

One of them is attempted to workaround in [datalad/pull/6510](https://github.com/datalad/datalad/pull/6510) is due to the fact that `annex find` did not only change its output (which seems to ignore having `--json --json-error-messages` and not providing json records with errors) but also not even exiting no longer with non-0 exit code:

```
(git-annex)lena:/tmp/testds[master]
$> git annex find --copies 0 --json --json-error-messages qwdqwd csdc
error: pathspec 'qwdqwd' did not match any file(s) known to git
error: pathspec 'csdc' did not match any file(s) known to git
Did you forget to 'git add'?

$> echo $?
0

$> git annex version
git-annex version: 10.20220222+git23-g51c528980-1~ndall+1
```
