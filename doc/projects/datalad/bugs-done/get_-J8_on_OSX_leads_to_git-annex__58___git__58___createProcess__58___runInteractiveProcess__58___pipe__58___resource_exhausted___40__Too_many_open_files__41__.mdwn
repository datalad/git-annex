Full bundle of logs with a bit older (20191230) and this newer version, and full output of `datalad wtf` is available from [http://www.onerussian.com/tmp/git-annex-J8-logs.tar.gz](http://www.onerussian.com/tmp/git-annex-J8-logs.tar.gz).

possibly related, but not yet marked done [issue I found is from 6 years ago](https://git-annex.branchable.com/bugs/Resource_exhausted/).

I have tried to replicate this on some other OSX boxes a few weeks back but I have not reproduced it, so might be specific about this one.  FWIW `ulimit` reported "unlimited"

I will try to get a chance to troubleshoot it more to provide possibly more details whenever I get access to it again.  Meanwhile just informing, and would welcome additional instructions on what to look at (besides adding `--debug` and running lsof in a loop in parallel) to troubleshoot it.
