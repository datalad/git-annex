Well, I ran the reproducer script, substituting a git-annex tarball with
the fix (and adding an output of the exit code and dropping the --debug),
and the end was:

	get f0 (from r...) 
	SHA256E-s2--9a271f2a916b0b6ee6cecb2426f0b3206ef074578be55d9bc94f6f3fe3ab86aa2 
	100%    1.95kB/s    0:00:00 (xfr#1, to-chk=0/1)
	(checksum...) ok
	(recording state in git...)
	0

So, I guess this patch is ok, at least with the git-annex I've built.
(Using haskell from debian unstable.) It seems possible that some older
ghc, async, etc might have handled that AsyncCancelled differently and
resulted in the behavior you're seeing.

Also tried with https://downloads.kitenet.net/git-annex/autobuild/i386-ancient/git-annex-standalone-i386-ancient.tar.gz
and it's ok too.
