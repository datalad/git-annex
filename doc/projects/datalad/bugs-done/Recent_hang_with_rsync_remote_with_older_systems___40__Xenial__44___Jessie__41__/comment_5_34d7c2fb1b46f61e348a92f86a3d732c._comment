Fair enough.

> or that the hang is not fully deterministic.

Perhaps.  I haven't hit any divergent results yet, but that of course
doesn't mean that much.

In my view, it'd be okay to close this issue, as well as [the other
Xenial/old system stall][0].  These are related to SSH-based stalls
that DataLad is hitting on Travis, and it would of course be nice to
resolve them, but it probably isn't worth investing much more time in.
And on DataLad's end, we should probably upgrade our CI's distribution
from Xenial to Bionic anyway.

That being said, if you think of specific debugging information that
might be useful for me to provide or if you want access to the Xenial
qcow2 image (a bloated 25G :/), please let me know.

Thanks for your feedback on this issue and the other one.
