Okay, short summary:

  * The demo script above no longer hangs as of 4c9ad1de4
    (optimisation: stream keys through git cat-file --buffer,
    2020-07-10).

  * Going to the parent of 4c9ad1de4 (1df9e72), the hang is still
    there.

  * The first patch advances the output by one line but still hangs,
    with the line at the time of the hang being \"process done
    ExitSuccess\".

  * The second patch removes the hang (again, this is from the parent
    of 4c9ad1de4).

---

The above is all based on working in a Xenial VM, building from source
with stack.  The Docker-based approach above provides a reproducer,
but it depends on the autobuild downloads.  It'd need quite a bit more
work to have the full stack setup there.  However, running the above
script without Docker caching, I've confirmed the most recent
autobuild, which has 4c9ad1de4, no longer hangs.

It seems at least plausible that 4c9ad1de4 affected the stall because
it looks to deal with git-annex-get.  However, perhaps that's just
resolving the issue for this particular case, and it still makes sense
to apply the second the patch?
