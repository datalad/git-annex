@yarik no, it needs to check all files. Consider what happens when `foo` is
an annexed link to key K, which is not present, and you copy 
`.git/annex/objects/../K` from some other repo and run `git annex add K`
(or reinject, or get, it's all the same) -- `foo` now points to the content
of K. The same needs to also hold true for unlocked files, and so it has to
check if `foo` is an unlocked pointer to K and populate the file with the
content. Repeat for all the other 9999 files..
