Thank you Joey for all the OPTs. 
Looking at it again: the significant impact seems to be OSX builds specific: Linux and Windows builds did get just a bit slower (if at all).  So may be situation is not that dire ;-)  Two possibilities:

- Even though coincidences like this are unlikely, it is possible that OSX VMs on Github actions got slower? 
- may be the RFing is somehow effecting OSX specifically?

I will try to do some timings locally.  Also I should finally get those logs (and built packages) into some more convenient form using [tinuous](https://github.com/con/tinuous/) John has been developing -- would allow for easy greps instead of all these jumping through CIs etc.
