I can't think of anything OSX specific in the recent changes.

I have added debugging of when reconcileStaged wakes up and possibly
wastes some time, eg:

	joey@darkstar:~/tmp/big> git config annex.debug true
	joey@darkstar:~/tmp/big> git config annex.debugfilter Database.Keys
	joey@darkstar:~/tmp/big> git-annex init
	init  
	[2021-06-08 11:52:11.854202926] (Database.Keys) reconcileStaged start
	(scanning for annexed files...)
	[2021-06-08 11:52:44.092620256] (Database.Keys) reconcileStaged end
	ok

All the new work happens in between those two debugs[1], so you could check if
the time sink is there or elsewhere.

(Note that the last release takes 2 seconds longer for that init than
it does now..)

[1] With the exception of a single call to `git write-tree`, but that
should be very fast.
