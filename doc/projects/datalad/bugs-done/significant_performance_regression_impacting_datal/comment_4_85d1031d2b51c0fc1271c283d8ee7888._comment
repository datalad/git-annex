Turns out `git-annex init` got a lot slower than it had to, it was doing
the same kind of scan twice. I think that probably explains much of the
slowdown you saw. (Although it still needs to do somewhat more work than
before, but also does it more efficiently than before.)

Also I've optimised the update scan's use of git, around a 20% speedup,
although I don't know if your test case speed was impacted much by that
scan anyway.
