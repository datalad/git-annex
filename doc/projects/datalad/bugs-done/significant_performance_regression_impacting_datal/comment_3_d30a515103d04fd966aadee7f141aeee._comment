Also worth saying: When I have a choice between a bug fix and a performance
change, I kind of have to pick the bug fix.
[[bugs/indeterminite_preferred_content_state_for_duplicated_file]] was a

remove include= and exclude= from the preferred content expression syntax,
which would prevent a lot of current uses of preferred content.
