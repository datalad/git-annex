For completeness 

> Looking at the CI log, I don't see any past runs that took 1h 46min. A month ago they were taking 2h 6min. 

I was looking at OSX ones. And the timing was for the one right before slow down: It was [this one](https://github.com/datalad/git-annex/actions/runs/873390021), but even [previous one](https://github.com/datalad/git-annex/actions/runs/869970007) was 1h40min

> Let's see if the changes I'm pushing now drop it back to that.

🤞
