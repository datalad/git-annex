FWIW, without having a clear idea on code logic/data structures, it smells a bit like somewhere may be it could be `any` vs current `all` operation/check (in case of `add` at least) if needed just to test if there is already a path with a given key, and assuming that DB doesn't require a full rewrite of all `path` entries if a new path added for the key.
