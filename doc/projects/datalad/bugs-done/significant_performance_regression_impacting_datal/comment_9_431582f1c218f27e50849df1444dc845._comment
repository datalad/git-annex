I do not see 1h40min anywhere on the page you linked. It says
2h 6m at the top. Oh I see, you are clicking around to get to
https://github.com/datalad/git-annex/runs/2661363385?check_suite_focus=true,
and that number is in there next to "Run datalad tests".

My improvements yesterday did not improve your test suite time any. But
they certainly sped it up a *lot* in my benchmarks. So I think what you
think is taking more time, eg the scanning at init, does not really have
much to do with whatever is really taking more time. And if your test suite
is mostly not cloning repos but is initializing new empty repos, then the
scanning at init was and still is effectively a noop, it will not have
gotten more expensive.

It might be that the incremental updating git-annex now does when it sees
changes to the index is making your test suite run a bit longer. But twice
as long? That is not a very expensive process.

Also notice that the git-annex test part of the CI job used to take
15m54s and is now taking 17m29s. That's doing some cloning and some adding
of files etc, and it didn't double in run time.

I did find another nice optimisation this morning
[[!commit c831a562f550e6ff93e081f555eced3a8a0d524f]], so we can see if that
improves things in the next run.

I suspect you're going to have to look at specific parts of your test suite
and/or the CI system to identify what's slower though.
