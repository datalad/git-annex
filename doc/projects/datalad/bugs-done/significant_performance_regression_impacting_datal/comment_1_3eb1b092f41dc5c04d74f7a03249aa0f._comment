Oh, fresh runs datalad tests fail because I guess you implemented that \"don't display message unless takes awhile\" I spotted in one of the comments but didn't have a chance to follow up - I guess from now on we weren't be able to test us passing through messages from git annex (unless there is some setting where were could disable that feature during tests).

That is unrelated to this issue of slow down though
