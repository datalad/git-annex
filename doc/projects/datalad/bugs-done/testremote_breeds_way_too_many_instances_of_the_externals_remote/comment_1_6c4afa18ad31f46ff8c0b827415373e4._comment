There should be 4-8, because it does make that many remote
variants, each with a different config.

But, each individual test case is starting a process.

This is a reversion from around [[!commit 9fa940569c7941ad794637017ae5296e657c7f8d]].
To make git-annex test be able to use testremote, that deferred generating
Remote objects to inside the TestTree.. So it generates them when running
each test case.

Other remotes that allocate other resources will also allocate too many,
not cache http connections in testremote, etc.

The test suite was also affected in its use of testremote, but only
tested a directory special remote so I think avoided any bad behavior.

Fixed.
