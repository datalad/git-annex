> I also wonder if there could be some unittest added to test that annex stays "lean" (in terms of child processes) while using external remotes.

Normally it will only start one per thread, testremote is unique in
generating variants of a remote.

It would be good to somehow catch situations where a lot of child processes
get spawned in general, like the earlier -J8 starting too many
git helper processes. But I don't know how a test suite could detect or
judge that.

Some of the work done for
[[todo/more_extensive_retries_to_mask_transient_failures]]
avoids potential situations where part of git-annex could leak a process
during exception handling. Continuing work on that will probably improve
things further.
