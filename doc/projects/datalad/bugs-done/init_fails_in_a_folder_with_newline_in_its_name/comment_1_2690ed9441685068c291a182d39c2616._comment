Unfortunately, `git hash-object --stdin-paths` does not support
-z or anything like that. It is a newline based protocol.

Ok, made git-annex fall back to running git hash-object once
per file when the filenames contain newlines to work around that.

BTW, another problem I noticed is that the repository decription
written to uuid.log contains a newline, which prevents parsing that line of
the log correctly. This can also be seen by passing a value
with a newline to `git-annex describe`. It would also happen in the
case with the newline directory if it didn't fail earlier.

Also fixed this, though, with a one-way escaping, 
see [[!commit 38e9ea8497bb2ab058e5bd46a666857789c0a84d]].
