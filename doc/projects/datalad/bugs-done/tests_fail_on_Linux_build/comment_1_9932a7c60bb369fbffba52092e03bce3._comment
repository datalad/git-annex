[[!commit d44fb89d4f4d3120a34a192025ee901c064cab00]] fixed a problem
with the same underlying cause.
Also, [[!commit d44fb89d4f4d3120a34a192025ee901c064cab00]]

Like those, this certianly cannot affect actual use of git-annex
as the string QuickCheck has magiced up is normally unable to be produced
by any input when LANG=C, and is not a problem in unicode locales.

Probably there ought to be a newtype wrapper around FilePath with a more
sane Arbitrary instance, since the default haskell one has this problem.
Limiting to ascii only is probably fine. It would be good to use that in
every quickcheck property, so we can stop tripping over these.

(Also worth noting: As soon as everything gets converted to RawFilePath
entirely, this entire class of problems goes away (and git-annex gets
faster too).)

(I wonder if it's also just a bug in QuickCheck, but it's hard to see how
it could both do any testing of unicode and work in LANG=C given that
Arbitrary is pure and has no way of knowing the locale.)
