oh, just now realized that `git-annex.exe` is in **exactly** the same `C:\Program Files (x86)\Git\usr\bin` as `cp` etc -- so specifying specific path of where `git-annex.exe` installed (I bet the process would know which dir it is coming from) to `cp` and all those tools for a windows build could potentially make those installations more robust overall.
