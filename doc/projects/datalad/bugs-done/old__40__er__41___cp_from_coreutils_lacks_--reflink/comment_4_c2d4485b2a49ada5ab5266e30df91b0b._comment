I installed git for windows in a fresh windows 10
VM. Then I installed git-annex from the git-annex for windows installer. 
Then I ran git-annex add, which ran cp --reflink successfully.

But you didn't say how you installed git-annex on windows, did you?
I guess, since you're building it yourself, you put it into path somewhere
else. So it seems to me, it's the up to you to make its path include the
same cp you built it against. 

Or just build the windows installer too, and install your git-annex build
using that.
