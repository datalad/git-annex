If whatever is putting itself at the front of PATH, I think it would
also risk breaking any part of git that expects to run another part of it
by path. Including any git commands that use the bundled cp or other
unix commands.

Perhaps the problem is that you're mixing two different package systems?
If there's going to be a datalad package, there should also be a git-annex
package, and then it can be built to use the right cp options for its
distibution.
