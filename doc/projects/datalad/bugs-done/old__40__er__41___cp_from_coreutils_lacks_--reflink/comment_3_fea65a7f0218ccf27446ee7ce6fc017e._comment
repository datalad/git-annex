I'm not going to make git-annex probe everything at run time. The
user can find more ways to break their environment than I can probe for,
and sheer code complexity, and runtime complexity, and debug complexity, 
and run time would all be affected.

The way git-annex is installed into git for windows's path is supposed to both
make "git annex" work and also put it in the same directory that git for
windows installs curl and cp. IIRC on windows a program automatically
looks in its directory along with the path, so that makes them available
to git-annex. There are probably configurations that make some other path
be used in preference, or perhaps something changed in git for windows's
locations of these things, although the path you show sounds like the same
one I'd expect git-annex.exe to be in. I do know that used to work.

--reflink seems unlikely to do anything useful on windows
even if the option is supported, so it could just be defaulted to not
supported on windows. -a/-p/--preserve-timestamps are more important and
also probed at build time.
