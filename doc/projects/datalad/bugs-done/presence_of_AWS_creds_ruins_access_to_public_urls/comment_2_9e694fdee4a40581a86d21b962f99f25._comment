Ok, I've made autoenable not take creds from the environment, which will
avoid the problem.

If there are any external special remotes that might behave similarly,
it would need an extension to the external special remote protocol to
support them. Currently `INITREMOTE` is sent during auto-enable, and so
the protocol would need to have `ENABLEREMOTE` and `AUTOENBLEREMOTE` added
to it. Since that would need an extension and I don't know if any externals
actually look at env vars etc at (auto)enable time, I've skipped doing it
for now.
