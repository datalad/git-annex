Yes, it's a behavior change. But the old behavior meant users had to set
env vars when doing something that has nothing to do with enabling remotes,
which is not a reasonable thing to expect users to do.

If you relied on autoenabling of remotes that need creds to enable, you
will need to change to explicitly enabling them.
