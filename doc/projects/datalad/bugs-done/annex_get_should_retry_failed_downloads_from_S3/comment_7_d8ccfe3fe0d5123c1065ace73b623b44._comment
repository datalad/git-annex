Unfortunately the more I dig into pid locking, the more deep problems I'm
finding..

When the pid lock's LockHandle is dropped, it drops the pid lock, and that
happens even if there is another LockHandle for the pid lock, which is
possble since it's a shared lock. So the pid lock may go away despite
a thread is still operating as if it is present. I think probably the pid
lock needs to stop using the LockPool and use a single LockHandle, which is
ref counted.

`getLockStatus` and `checkSaneLock` look at the status of the pid lock,
but not yet at the fine-grained STM lock status. And as implemented,
I think they never worked at all, since they check for posix locks on the
pid lock file.
