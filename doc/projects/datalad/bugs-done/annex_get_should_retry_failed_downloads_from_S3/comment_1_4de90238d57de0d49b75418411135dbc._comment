It seems that every failure in that log is preceeded by "transfer already
in progress, or unable to take transfer lock".

It does not make sense to retry in such a case because the transfer will
probably still be in progress so the retry would fail.

So I don't think this really involves retrying (which certianly supports
S3). The question is why are several transfers failing this way.
My suspicion would be something to do with pid locking.

And indeed, I can reproduce the same behavior in a local repo getting from
another local repo, once I set annex.pidlock.
