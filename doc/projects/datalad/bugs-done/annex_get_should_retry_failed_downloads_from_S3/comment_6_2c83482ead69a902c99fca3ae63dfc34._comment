I noticed that there is a FD leak when pidlock is enabled.
About 1 file in 10 that is processed,
there is a handle to ".git/annex/pidlock.lck" that is left open.
This is not a regression caused by my fix above, bug is in older git-annex
too.

Also, I have the fine-grained locking implemented in the pidlockfinegrained
branch now, but am waiting to merge it for testing and to resolve the above
problem first.
