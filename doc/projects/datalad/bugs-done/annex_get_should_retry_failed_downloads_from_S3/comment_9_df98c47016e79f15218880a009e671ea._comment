Unfortunately, [[!commit 66b2536ea0aa5c88f5b744eeace3322a8a4a10b6]]
broke shared locking when pid locks are not used, causing a FD leak,
and had to be reverted. Which further breaks concurrent pid locking. 

At this point, when -J is used with pidlock, it may drop the lock but
still think it has it held internally. Comment #7 found another way that
could happen, and the conclusion is that the pid lock must migrate away
from using the lock pool.
