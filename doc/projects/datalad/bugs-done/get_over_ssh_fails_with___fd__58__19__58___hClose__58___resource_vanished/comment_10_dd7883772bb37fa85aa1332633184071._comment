Ok, reproduced by downgrading git-annex, so it is a reversion in the
fallback from p2pstdio.

It is indeed caused by [[!commit b18fb1e343e9654207fbebacf686659c75d0fb4c]],
because that adds a new ProtocolEOF value, and postAuth has a fallthrough
case that tries to then send a ERROR message back over the connection, but
by that time the pipe has closed.

So that was an easy fix. I do still wonder how a system that displays
/etc/issue or whatever to noninteractive logins could have ever worked with
rsync or git-annex. But if that system doesn't work after this fix, it's an
unrelated problem.
