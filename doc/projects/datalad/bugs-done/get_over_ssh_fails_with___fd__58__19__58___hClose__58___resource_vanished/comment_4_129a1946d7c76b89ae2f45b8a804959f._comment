Downgrading (testing on local laptop) local git-annex all the way down (didn't try intermediates yet) to 6.20170101-1+deb9u2  helped - I can fetch data from that server.

My wild guess is that it all relates to the fact that remote git-annex-shell, being outdated, has no clue about `p2pstdio` command, and local new git-annex doesn't fall back anyhow to use some other way to transfer.
