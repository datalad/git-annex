I tried configuring sshd with PrintMotd yes, that actually resulted in
double motd on interactive login, but still none on noninteractive login,
and doesn't cause this problem.

I tried making ~/.bashrc echo some stuff. That also didn't reproduce the
problem, though debug does have this:

	[2018-09-25 12:40:18.092800592] P2P > ERROR auth failed

It does not give up, but goes on to use rsync. Although rsync unsurprisingly 
also fails "protocol version mismatch -- is your shell clean?".

Still, this seems to indicate that the motd display shown in your transcripts is
at the root of the problem, although I've not fully replicated the circumstances
and will need more information to get further on this.
