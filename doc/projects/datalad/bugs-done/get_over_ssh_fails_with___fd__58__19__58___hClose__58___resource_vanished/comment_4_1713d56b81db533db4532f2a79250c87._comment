The only new change in 6.20180913 that might somehow affect this is 
[[!commit b18fb1e343e9654207fbebacf686659c75d0fb4c]]. But I don't see how
it could really.

Since ssh seems to be displaying a motd when running a noninteractive
command, I think that git-annex must be seeing that motd where it
expects to see the P2P protocol.

Although it may be that ssh -T avoids the motd display. (But unfortunately
your transcript using -T trims out exactly that part!) I didn't think ssh
normally displays motd when not running a login shell. Perhaps it's
something to do with your shell and not ssh.

git-annex will fall back to not using p2pstdio, but only if the command
exits nonzero without ssh sending anything to stdout.
