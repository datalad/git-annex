It certianly seems possible that
[[!commit 6ecd55a9fa4c64399b5ede3944bd2aa5f78cf0b1]]
could have introduced a locking problem causing such a crash, 
assuming you are running that version (can't tell from your version string
due to the git rev not being one from the git-annex repo). 

As Andrew noted, the multiple ssh password prompt issue is expected if you
are using `GIT_SSH` or `GIT_SSH_COMMAND`. From discussion in 
<https://github.com/datalad/datalad/issues/2988> it seems like you might
be?

The fact that it says 
"(transfer already in progress, or unable to take transfer lock)" strongly
suggests they you have annex.pidlock set locally. It would be good to know
about this or other configuration.

I have not had any luck reproducing the crash so far. I have tried setting
`GIT_SSH`, `GIT_ANNEX_USE_GIT_SSH`, and `annex.pidlock`.
