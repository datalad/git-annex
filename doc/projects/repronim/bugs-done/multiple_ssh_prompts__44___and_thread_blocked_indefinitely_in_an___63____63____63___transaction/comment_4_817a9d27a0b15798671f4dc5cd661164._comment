>  (can't tell from your version string due to the git rev not being one from the git-annex repo)

patch for my \"custom\" version is now (if was not before) sent out -- needs adjustment in standalone patch

> As Andrew noted, the multiple ssh password prompt issue is expected if you are using GIT_SSH or GIT_SSH_COMMAND. From discussion in https://github.com/datalad/datalad/issues/2988 it seems like you might be?

in [a comment on that issue](https://github.com/datalad/datalad/issues/2988#issuecomment-437088252) I call `git annex` directly, so I think I did not have any custom env settings set...  Moreover as I [commented further](https://github.com/datalad/datalad/issues/2988#issuecomment-437095621) nothing changed when I set `GIT_ANNEX_USE_GIT_SSH=1` which I guess should have counteracted?  
I have tried now with `6.20170815+gitg22da64d0f-1~ndall+1` -- provides a single prompt. 
Here is again output now also checking for SSH variables:
[[!format sh \"\"\"

smth like?

[[!format sh \"\"\"
[yhalchen@discovery7 QA]$ git config annex.pidlock
false
\"\"\"]]

I also no longer see that \"transfer already in progress...\" - may be I changed config since then:

[[!format sh \"\"\"
[yhalchen@discovery7 QA]$ git annex version | head -n1 ; git annex get -J2 sub-qa/
git-annex version: 7.20181105+git22-g4c7236c58-1~ndall+1
get sub-qa/ses-20161128/dwi/sub-qa_ses-20161128_acq-DTIX30Xp2Xs4_dwi.nii.gz get sub-qa/ses-20161128/dwi/sub-qa_ses-20161128_acq-DTIX30Xp2_dwi.nii.gz (from origin...)

FWIW, I have now ran `git annex test` with TMPDIR on that partition, with
[[!format sh \"\"\"
157 out of 293 tests failed (686.03s)
\"\"\"]]
as the result. [HEre is the full log](http://www.onerussian.com/tmp/annex-test-7.20181105+git22-g4c7236c58.txt) -- may be it would give you some hints.
