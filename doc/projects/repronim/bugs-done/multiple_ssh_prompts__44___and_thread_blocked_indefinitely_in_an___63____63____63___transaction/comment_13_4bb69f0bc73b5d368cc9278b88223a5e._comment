I don't think this bug will be able to be tracked down without
rebuilding git-annex one way or another.

I could use the technique in
<https://www.fpcomplete.com/blog/2018/05/pinpointing-deadlocks-in-haskell>
to instrument every possible place in git-annex that could deadlock.
This would be a lot of work, probably hundreds of lines of code changes.

It seems much easier to either find a way to reproduce the problem
outside of this one machine with the problem, or bisect it.
