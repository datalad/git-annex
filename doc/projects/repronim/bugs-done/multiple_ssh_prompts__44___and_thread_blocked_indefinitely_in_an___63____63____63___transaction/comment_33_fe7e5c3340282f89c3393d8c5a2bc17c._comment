As of 451145738267b5858132554da2367a78c145b610 git-annex depends on the
hopefully fixed concurrent-output, so if you build that version and it
works at the command line, we can know for sure.

You'll need to run `cabal update; cabal install --only-dependencies` in the
git-annex source dir to get the fixed concurrent-output installed before
building git-annex.
