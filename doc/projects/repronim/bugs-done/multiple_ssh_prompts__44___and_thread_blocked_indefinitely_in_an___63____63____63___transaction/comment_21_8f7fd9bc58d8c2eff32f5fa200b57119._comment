I've added a DebugLocks build flag to try to track down the source
of the deadlock. It's not enabled by default, so you'll need to eg modify
the Makefile to set it:

	cabal configure -fDebugLocks

Calls to `debugLocks` are scattered around in a several of the places I
suspect may be involved, around ssh prompting, transfer locks, and
general lock files. If one of them is, it will display line number
information when the deadlock happens.

It will probably take several iterations of adding more calls to
`debugLocks` to narrow in on the code that is involved in the
deadlock.
