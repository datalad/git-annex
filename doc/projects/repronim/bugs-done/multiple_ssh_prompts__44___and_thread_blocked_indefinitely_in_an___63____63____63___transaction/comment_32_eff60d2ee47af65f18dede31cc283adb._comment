Ok so we know for sure it's crashing in Message.prompt, good.

I see you mean that my commit to git-annex that avoids using
concurrent-output in some circumstances "fixed" it. I'm not sure how your
bisection environment avoids those circumstances; it does not seem to be
passing --quiet or --json to git-annex. Perhaps piping the git-annex output
causes it to decide it's not on a tty and so avoid using concurrent-output.
Perhaps it's a locale setting. Doesn't really matter..

Except, it seems we have still not verified that the actual source of the
crash in concurrent-output is really fixed. That needs building with
concurrent-output 1.10.8 and then trying to reproduce the crash
at the command line.
