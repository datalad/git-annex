so it is all destructive Ilya's comments! ;)

That is a commit right after the 6.20180926 which I chose as \"good\" since the good was the 6.20180926-gc906aaf (installed via conda  build pl5.22.2.1_0).  
So may be the problem is not in git annex per se but in its build-depends, which changed in buster (I've been building standalones with buster for a while).
I will try to do manual comparison across a number of builds from datalad.
