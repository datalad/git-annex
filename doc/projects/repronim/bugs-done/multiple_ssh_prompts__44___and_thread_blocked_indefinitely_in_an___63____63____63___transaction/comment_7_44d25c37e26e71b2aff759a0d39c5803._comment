	git-annex: thread blocked indefinitely in an STM transaction

So sshing without letting it prompt for a password has failed.
The next thing git-annex should do at that point is take a lock
to prevent concurrent prompts (which does not use STM), 
ask concurrent-output to hide any regions from the display
(which does use STM), and run ssh again to prompt. 

It's apparently crashing before it can run ssh again. (Although I'm not really
sure if it is, it's also possible it overwrote some of the debug output while
trying to hide console regions. Please capture a complete typescript.)

It could be that concurrent-output's waitDisplayChange is buggy,
with some kind of race. But this does not seem to be behaving like a race condition,
does it? It happens every time?
