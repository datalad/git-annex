FWIW 1, it was a switch from ghc 8.0.1-17+b1 because it was when (I guess) I switched from Debian stable (stretch) to testing (buster) build environment since build-dependencies were no longer satisfiable!

FWIW 2, I have now tested the build in debian unstable with ghc 8.4.3+dfsg1-4 -- the same issue with locks
