The problems at least so far appear to be related; it should be enough
to bisect the easier one to deal with.

BTW, I noticed a couple of weird things that may or may not be related.
Your repository is on NFS but annex.pidlock is not set, which I guess means
that NFS is providing working real locking, or perhaps subtly broken real
locking. And, the test suite failed with permission denied when writing a
file, which is very strange.
