My comment in the concurrent-output commit was that I didn't think git-annex
could be affected, since it can only call waitDisplayChange once at a
time. That analysis still looks right to me; Messages.prompt takes the
promptLock before calling it.

So I want to make very sure that fix did fix it, and it's not masked by
some other change to the build environment, or by the problem being more
intermittent than you thought it was. It would be good if you can
revert the concurrent-output change, reproduce, re-introduce the change,
and verify it fixes it.
