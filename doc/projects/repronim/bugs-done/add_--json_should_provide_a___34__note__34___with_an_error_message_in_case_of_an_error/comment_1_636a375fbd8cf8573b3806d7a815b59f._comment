From \"any program parsing stderr for json would somehow have to deal with this non-json that could be mixed up with it, which seems very hard\" at 
[another bug page](https://git-annex.branchable.com/bugs/git-annex-copy_--json-error-messages_does_not_write_error_messages_to_stderr_) , it sounds like parsing the output of `--json-error-messages` might not be reliable?
