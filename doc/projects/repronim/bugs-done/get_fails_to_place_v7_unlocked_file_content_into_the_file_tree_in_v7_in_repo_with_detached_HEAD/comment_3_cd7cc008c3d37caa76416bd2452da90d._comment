I notice that the keys database is not populated in the clone.

Also, the upgrade does not display "scanning for unlocked files".
And in Annex.WorkTree, we can see why:

	scanUnlockedFiles = whenM (isJust <$> inRepo Git.Branch.current) $ do
	        showSideAction "scanning for unlocked files"

There is no current git branch in this case.

That check was added in [[!commit 9b995954731e05727d77c7bff487af10da9cb4b9]]
"only do scan when there's a branch, not in freshly created new repo"

Since it does a ls-tree of HEAD, what it really ought to check for is that
HEAD is set, which it's not in a fresh new repo. Done.
