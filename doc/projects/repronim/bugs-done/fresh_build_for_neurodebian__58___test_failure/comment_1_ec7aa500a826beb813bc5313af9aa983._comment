This is the same problem I tried to deal with in 
[[!commit f27c5db5c566bdc0baae256b67df04a50027679f]].
Apparently not fully

Or at least the double run of rsync with no indication
why it thought the first one failed appears to be the same.
And IIRC I saw that sometimes without the permissions error and it still
failed.

I was having to run git-annex test in a loop for an hour or so to reproduce
it.

So, for some reason git-annex thinks the rsync failed, although it got to
100%. If that happens once, it retries automatically. The second time it
thinks rsync has failed, it sees the file didn't get any larger,
and so gives up. That makes sense, but I don't know how rsync would get 
to 100% and then apparently exit nonzero, without displaying any error
message.
