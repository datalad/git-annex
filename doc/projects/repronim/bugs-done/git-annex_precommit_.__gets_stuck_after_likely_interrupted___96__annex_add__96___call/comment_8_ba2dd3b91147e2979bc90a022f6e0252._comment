The precommit.lck is no longer used, it was not needed since v8. But
this bug does not really appear to be about that lock at all.

Pity there was no followup to my last questions. At this point I can either
close the bug report, or mark it moreinfo or something, but it seems pretty
unlikely we will get to the bottom of it.
