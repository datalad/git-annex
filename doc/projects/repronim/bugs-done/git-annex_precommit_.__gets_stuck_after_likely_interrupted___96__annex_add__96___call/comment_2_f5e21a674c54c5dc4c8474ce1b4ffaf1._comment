Removing .lck, setting `annex.pidlock=true` worked! got just one complaint from git:

[[!format sh \"\"\"
$ git commit -m 'Committing staged changes after annex process was killed
>
> Also removed stale .git/annex/*.lck and now set annex.pidlock=True for the repo'
(recording state in git...)
git-annex: .git/annex/journal/e64_e4a_MD5E-s55076--a7352bf6fd37902fc1dfb6228f2e8a53.log: removeLink: does not exist (No such file or directory)

\"\"\"]]
I found that file (via `find *  -lname *MD5E-s55076--a7352bf6fd37902fc1dfb6228f2e8a53*` FTR), it was not known to git yet, so I am now running `annex add` on it (takes awhile -- I guess repo is indeed got large + NFS) -- will report back when done/if there is more.
