Since this is NFS, does it have annex.pidlock set?

If so, an stale pid lock (.git/annex/pidlock) can cause a stall, for up to
annex.pidlockimeout seconds.

The hang points seem consistent with it preparing to commit the journal to
the git-annex branch and indeed something related to locking.
An strace would tell for sure.
