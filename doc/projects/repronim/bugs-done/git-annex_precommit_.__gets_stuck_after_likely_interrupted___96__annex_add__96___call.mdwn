### Please describe the problem.

TL;DR - it seems that obsolete `.git/annex/index.lck  .git/annex/journal.lck  .git/annex/precommit.lck` could cause a new process to hang  on `git commit` or `git annex add` without announcing any problem. git annex version installed is 7.20181211-g1cdb7a2.  But that seems to be not a complete reason - and after removing them still gets stuck


I think we initiated `git annex add` invocation over remote ssh session, and then connection eventually dropped before `git annex add` finished.  The repository is large - 47k files.
So we ended up with some files annex/staged, some just annexed (symlinks to keys), and some not yet tracked by git and in their original form.

I thought to commit first at least what we had already staged, but `git commit` pretty much hanged there for an hour.  It is an NFS mount on an HPC, so IO is not stellar but an hour with little to no CPU consumed sounds like it just got stuck.
I have checked ps and saw that it is in the `pre-commit` hook with two zombies.  Interrupted and ran manually with `--debug`:

[[!format sh """

Retrying to add everything again seems to lead to a stall as well:

looking at the list of files for 26126 process I see `.git/annex/journal.lck`  which seems to date to ` Feb 27 ` (3 weeks ago!), and altogether there are 3 lock files from that date:
`.git/annex/index.lck  .git/annex/journal.lck  .git/annex/precommit.lck`. 
FWIW, NFS mount options `type nfs4 (rw,relatime,vers=4.1,rsize=1048576,wsize=1048576,namlen=255,hard,proto=tcp,timeo=600,retrans=2,sec=sys,clientaddr=10.201.0.82,local_lock=none,addr=10.201.2.178)`

I have removed them, and then called `git commit` which seemed to proceed normally, got to report `(recording state in git...)` but then seemed to get stuck as well:

There is also two `.git/annex/misctmp/jlog*` files with one from Feb 28 and one from today.  Today's one is bigger, and used by 31901 but seems not to change for the last 15 minutes.

what could be a reason and any way to mitigate?
