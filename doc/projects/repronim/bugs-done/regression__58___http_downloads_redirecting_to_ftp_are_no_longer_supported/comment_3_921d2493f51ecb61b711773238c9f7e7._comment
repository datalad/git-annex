The netrc(5) file does use the hostname of the ftp server, so if git-annex
swapped in an IP address it resolved it would not match the netrc file. But
curl only reads the file when --netrc is used.

If annex.web-options is set to --netrc (or anything), and
annex.security.allowed-http-addresses=all, git-annex uses curl already
and the security measures are disabled.

So, git-annex could replace the ftp server hostname with the IP address
when not so configured, and nothing that currently works would break, and
this problem would be solved without needing any new configuration.
