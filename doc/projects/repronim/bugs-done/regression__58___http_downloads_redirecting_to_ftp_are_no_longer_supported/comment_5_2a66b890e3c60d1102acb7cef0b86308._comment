Yet another problem: A ftp server might have both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses,
and only one might work. So git-annex would need to run curl more
than once if substituting in IP.

Hmm.. curl has a --resolve that could be used instead of git-annex
replacing the server hostname with its IP. This allows passing both ipv6
and ipv4 addresses:

	curl --resolve *:80:[::1],127.0.0.1 http://google.com/

And it does also work for ftp and other protocols, but the protocol port
number has to be included and can't be wildcarded. In particular, if 
the ftp url is on a nonstandard port, that port has to be included,
otherwise port 21.
