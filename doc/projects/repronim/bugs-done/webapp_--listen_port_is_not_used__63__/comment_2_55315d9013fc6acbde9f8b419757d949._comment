> What's your use case for wanting to specify a port?

it was to have some static port I could keep an ssh redirect pointing to so I could investigate behavior of the remote running annex webapp.

My 1c: Since AFAIK no ADDRESS could have `:` (unless some `ssh` based \"server:/path/to/socket\" which I do not think supported) so might be better to just crash (not just have it a matter of documentation) if `:\d+` part is found to be specified?
