IPv6 would beg to differ about `:\d+` ;-)

Actually, it may be that your address:port was treated as some IPv6 mixed
IPv4, iirc something like that is a thing.

> it was to have some static port I could keep an ssh redirect pointing to so I could investigate behavior of the remote running annex webapp.

You would still need to copy over the url though to get the access key
for the webapp..
