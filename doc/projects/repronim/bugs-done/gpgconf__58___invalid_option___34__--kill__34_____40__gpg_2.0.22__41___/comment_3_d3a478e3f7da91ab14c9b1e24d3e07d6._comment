From the log:

	    crypto:                                               gpgconf: invalid option "--kill"
	gpgconf: invalid option "--kill"
	FAIL (22.13s)
	      ./Test/Framework.hs:57:
	      copy --to encrypted remote failed (transcript follows)
	      copy foo (to foo...)
	      gpg: can't connect to the agent: Invalid value passed to IPC
	      gpg: problem with the agent: No agent running

That is not really be a problem with gpgconf --kill, but a problem
talking to gpg-agent.

The same crypto test fails a couple more times in that log, like this:

	    crypto:                                               gpgconf: invalid option "--kill"
	gpgconf: invalid option "--kill"
	FAIL (12.00s)
	      ./Test/Framework.hs:57:
	      get of file failed (transcript follows)
	      get foo (not available) 
	        No other repository is known to contain the file.
	      failed
	      get: 1 failed

That is also not a problem with gpgconf --kill, it's actually due to an
earlier test failure, unrelated to this. That earlier failure was
the one [the other issue](https://git-annex.branchable.com/bugs/__34__357_out_of_984_tests_failed__34___on_NFS_lustre_mount/)
was about, which has since been fixed. So we can ignore these I think,
leaving only the one above as an unexplained failure.

"gpg: can't connect to the agent: Invalid value passed to IPC" could 
be some kind of gpg bug. I found some other instances of gpg failing that way.
One involved using --homedir (similar to the test suite's
use of GNUPGHOME) but on windows.
<https://lists.gnupg.org/pipermail/gnupg-users/2016-October/056817.html>
And here's another one, in WSL when apt runs
gpg. <https://github.com/microsoft/WSL/issues/5125>

Perhaps this is a problem with the location of the gpg agent socket in the
filesystem that git-annex test is running in. That somehow messes up not
creation of that socket, but later use of it. It seems that the earlier
self-test of the test harness did not trigger the problem though, which is
odd because it sets up a gpg private key and I'd think would use the agent
too.

In [[!commit b426ff682570d8600dc8025bbcd20aa95819a7e4]] I considered
putting the gpg directory inside the system temp dir, which would perhaps
avoid the problem here. I've made that change.

Please test a fresh build on this system again, if you can..
