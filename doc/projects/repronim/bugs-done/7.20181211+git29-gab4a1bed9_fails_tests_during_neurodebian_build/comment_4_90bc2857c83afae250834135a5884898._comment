I've fixed the problem I described above. But I don't think it was the
same problem; the neurodebian build log is not complaining about missing
files/directories.

gpg in the test suite is using a separate home directory, so it starts a
separate gpg-agent process for that. If the test suite is run on a
filesystem where gpg-agent can't work, due say to unix sockets not being
supported, that might be why it fails.
