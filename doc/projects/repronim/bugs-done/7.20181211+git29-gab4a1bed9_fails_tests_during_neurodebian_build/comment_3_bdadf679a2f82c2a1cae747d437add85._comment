Having what seems a related problem on my i386 autobuilder:

	gpg: keyblock resource '/home/builder/gitbuilder/build/.t/tmprepo89/.git/annex/othertmp/gpgtest/2/pubring.kbx': No such file or directory
	gpg: failed to create temporary file '/home/builder/gitbuilder/build/.t/tmprepo89/.git/annex/othertmp/gpgtest/2/.#lk0x57fed950.orca.13095': No such file or directory
	gpg: can't connect to the agent: No such file or directory
	gpg: problem with the agent: No agent running
	gpg: can't create `/home/builder/gitbuilder/build/.t/tmprepo89/.git/annex/othertmp/gpgtest/2/random_seed': No such file or directory
	user error (gpg ["--batch","--no-tty","--use-agent","--quiet","--trust-model","always","--batch","--passphrase-fd","28","--symmetric","--force-mdc","--no-textmode"] exited 2)
	copy: 1 failed
	FAIL (2.31s)
	Test.hs:1645:
	copy --to encrypted remote failed

Probably gpg error output has failed, but this is also failing to connect
to the agent. And it seems a file/directory gpg expects to find is not present
when it's running in the test harness.
