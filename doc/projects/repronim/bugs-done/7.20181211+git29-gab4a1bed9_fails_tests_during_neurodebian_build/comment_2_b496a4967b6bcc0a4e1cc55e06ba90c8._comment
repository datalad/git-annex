cowbuilder is used, underlying file system (dedicated to debian pkgs building) is ext4.
but is it a filesystem effect somehow or just a \"partially\" isolated environment aspect (such as those pbuilder/cowbuilder chroots)?  The message `gpg: can't connect to the agent: IPC connect call failed` suggests that may be tests pass for you locally as connecting to your gpg agent?
