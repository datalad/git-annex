I'll bet [[!commit 14971414dc263fcb8124b4cf6b14b9b7a19189af]]
somehow led to this
since the test suite now runs gpg with its home 
directory set to be inside the test repo and not in the system's temporary
directory.

But I tested that commit on filesystems down to FAT, so it seems strange it
would fail on whatever filesystem you are testing on.
