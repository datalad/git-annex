Well, a specific filesystem or mount option that the script sets up, for
example. 

Or if it's something of that kind, it's also intermittent.

This will limit the test suite to only running the that test:

	git-annex test --pattern '/move (ssh remote)/ && /Repo Tests v8 unlocked/'

I have that repeating locally in a loop, in case it's just something that
happens every 1000 test runs or something like that.

(I've patched git-annex to speed up the above command 400%.)
