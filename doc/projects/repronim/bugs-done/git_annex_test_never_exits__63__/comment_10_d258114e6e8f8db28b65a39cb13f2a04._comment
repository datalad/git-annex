The retest seemed to hang again, but I'm not sure I was testing the right
binary. Running it again.

This patch exposes when the lock is held and so illustrates the bug
reliably and quickly:

	diff --git a/Command/Smudge.hs b/Command/Smudge.hs
	index a5d8871998..cf6e2973f8 100644
	--- a/Command/Smudge.hs
	+++ b/Command/Smudge.hs
	@@ -127,7 +129,8 @@ clean'

	 	-- ^ emitpointer: Emit a pointer file for the key.
	 	-> Annex ()
	-clean' file mk passthrough discardreststdin emitpointer =

	+	calcRestageLog () (\_ _ -> ())
 		ifM (fileOutsideRepo file)
	 		( passthrough
	 		, inSmudgeCleanFilter go

With that patch, the unfixed git-annex hangs immediately. With
my fix, it does not hang, which seems to show I fixed it correctly..
