<https://github.com/haskell/process/issues/152> forwarded with a
prospective patch.

----

Normally git-annex tries to use relative paths, and if it used a relative
path to .git/annex/index, it would avoid this problem. Except perhaps
if `GIT_DIR` pointed to a different directory with unicode in its path.
A relative `GIT_INDEX_FILE` would not suffice to close this bug, but would
fix your test suite. But, git has some very strange behavior with a relative
`GIT_INDEX_FILE`, it's not necessarily treated as relative to pwd.
So I'd rather not open that can of worms.
