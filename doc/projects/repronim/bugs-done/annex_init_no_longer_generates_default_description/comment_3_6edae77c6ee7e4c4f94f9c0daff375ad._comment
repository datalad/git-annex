Thanks Kyle, that does point at the problem. In uuidDescMapLoad
it implicitly adds the UUID of the current repo, with an empty 
description if none is set. So, the added check of uuidDescMap
always finds the UUID in it already. Your uuidDescMapLoad hack
avoids this by loading the map before the current repo has a UUID.

Fixed more cleanly..
