spotted that netbase is among recommends thus is not installed while `apt-get install --no-install-recommends git-annex-standalone` .  Installed and issue is gone.

- I feel like we had that issue/discussion before, but don't you think it would be valuable to make `netbase` a Depends not just Recommends?

- Also it would be nice if there was a more logical error, info or at least debug message whenever annex fails to perform network operations, instead of just marking remote as \"non-annex\".
