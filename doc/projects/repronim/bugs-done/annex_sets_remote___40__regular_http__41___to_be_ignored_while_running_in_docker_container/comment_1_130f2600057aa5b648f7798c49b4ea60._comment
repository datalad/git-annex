It does seem to work just fine with current git-annex outside
docker.

Given the insecurity-to-weight ratio of docker and the number of hoops
I would have to jump through to run that docker command, 
it may be several days until I have time, bandwidth, and power to try
it myself.. If you want to show the debug output, that generally doesn't
hurt.

(Please include the git-annex version information in all bug reports.)
