I'm inclined to think that rmurl should not look at url claiming at all,
and should remove whichever is set of the the url and the mangled version
used for claimed urls.

I think probably unregisterurl should do the same. Currently it
does not look at claiming and only removes the url, not the mangled form. 
But registerurl does look at claiming, and may add the mangled form,
so unregister may not undo the effets of register.
