oops -- forgot indeed to add the [actual link](http://git-annex.branchable.com/todo/windows_support/#comment-c1b06cae15fbebf97d58f5e7a498b2d2) - fixed now.

> The windows installation instructions are clear that only the 32 bit build of git for windows is supported.

Windows installation instructions say actually nothing about what is \"supported\" at all. What they say is \"If you installed the 64 bit version of git, then parts of git-annex will still run, however, some features, including tools like rsync, will not work.\"  So here was I -- exploring uncharted territories by installing git-annex to see what parts will run and which wouldn't.  As I found no other report of the issue I have ran into -- I have filed a new issue instead of staying silent.  If you feel that it is something you wouldn't be interested to fix ATM -- I can live with that. But at least others who run into a similar case could find this report, and I guess it would get fixed when that roadblock with rsync gets resolved.

Cheers!
