curl -v shows the problem response

It looks like the server is sending "preload" on its own line rather
than being part of the Strict-Transport-Security header.

Just in case, I found another url that uses HSTS preload, and git-annex
can download that:

	joey@darkstar:~>curl -v -o foo https://www.torproject.org/ 2>&1 | grep preload
	< Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=15768000; preload
	joey@darkstar:~/tmp/c>git annex addurl https://www.torproject.org/
	addurl https://www.torproject.org/ 
	(to www.torproject.org_) ok

The web server is probably violating standard HTTP to some extent with that
response. Of course, it's possible to parse the response less strictly and
not fail on the malformed header. Still, fixing the web server is probably the
fastest way to fix the immediate problem (as well as make HSTS preloading
actually be used).

Issue filed on http-client, <https://github.com/snoyberg/http-client/issues/398>
with a prospective patch.

I don't see any changes to git-annex that can help with the problem, so
I'll close this bug report.
