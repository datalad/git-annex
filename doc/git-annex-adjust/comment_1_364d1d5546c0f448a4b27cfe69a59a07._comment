From git-annex-fix manual:

       Fixes up symlinks that have become broken to again point to annexed content.
       This is useful to run manually when you have been moving the symlinks around, but is done automatically when committing a change with git too.
       Also, adjusts unlocked files to be copies or hard links as configured by annex.thin.

So what is the difference between that and git-annex adjust --fix?
