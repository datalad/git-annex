`git annex fix` fixes up the symlinks before they're committed.
It's run by the pre-commit hook, so even when annexed files are
manually moved around, the symlinks that get committed are always
right.

So then, if the symlinks committed are always right,
how would `git annex adjust --fix` be useful? Well,
there are ways to check out git repositories that make
the .git directory not be in the usual place. For example,
when using submodules, git puts that directory in a different place.
And then the committed symlinks won't point to .git. So,
`git annex adjust --fix` is useful as a way to adjust the symlinks
locally, without committing any changes to them, in that kind of
situation.
