Well, I don't always word-wrap paras when re-editing them, and several
people have had their hands on the man page and may have different wrapping
settings. 

My suggestion would be, if you need to re-wrap, or generally make
whitespace changes, do it in a separate commit from other changes. 
Similarly, make spelling corrections in a separate commit from any
substance changes.

Note that you can push man page commits directly to this site via git://
protocol, so it's not going to use my time as long as there's a reasonable
commit message.

Use backticks around any command name or fragment of a command line. 
Use quotes around program output, or other values that are not command
names or switch names.
