# NAME

git-annex describe - change description of a repository

# SYNOPSIS

git annex describe repository description

# DESCRIPTION

Changes the description of a repository.

The repository to describe can be specified by git remote name or
by uuid. To change the description of the current repository, use
"here".

Repository descriptions are displayed by git-annex in various places.
They are most useful when git-annex knows about a repository, but there is
no git remote corresponding to it.
