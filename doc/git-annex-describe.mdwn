# NAME

git-annex describe - change description of a repository

# SYNOPSIS

git annex describe repository description

# DESCRIPTION

Changes the description of a repository.

The repository to describe can be specified by git remote name or
by uuid. To change the description of the current repository, use
"here".

Repository descriptions are displayed by git-annex in various places.
They are most useful when git-annex knows about a repository, but there is
no git remote corresponding to it.

# OPTIONS

* `--json`

  Enable JSON output. This is intended to be parsed by programs that use
  git-annex. Each line of output is a JSON object.

* `--json-error-messages`

  Messages that would normally be output to standard error are included in
  the JSON instead.

* Also the [[git-annex-common-options]](1) can be used.
