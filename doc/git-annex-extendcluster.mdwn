# NAME

git-annex extendcluster - add an additional gateway to a cluster

# SYNOPSIS

git-annex extendcluster gateway clustername

# DESCRIPTION

This command is used to configure a repository to serve as an additional
gateway to a cluster. It is run in that repository.

The repository this command is run in should have a remote that is a
gateway to the cluster. The `gateway` parameter is the name of that remote.
The `clustername` parameter is the name of the cluster.

The next step after running this command is to configure
any additional cluster nodes that this gateway serves to the cluster,
then run [[git-annex-updatecluster]]. See the documentation of that
command for details about configuring nodes.

After running this command in the new gateway repository, it typically
also needs to be run in the other gateway repositories as well, 
after adding the new gateway repository as a remote.
