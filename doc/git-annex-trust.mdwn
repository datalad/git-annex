# NAME

git-annex trust - trust a repository

# SYNOPSIS

git annex trust `[repository ...]`

# DESCRIPTION

Records that a repository is trusted to not unexpectedly lose
content. Use with care.

Repositories can be specified using their remote name, their
description, or their UUID. To trust the current repository, use "here".

Before trusting a repository, consider this scenario. Repository A
is trusted and B is not; both contain the same content. `git-annex drop`
is run on repository A, which checks that B still contains the content,
and so the drop proceeds. Then `git-annex drop` is run on repository B,
which trusts A to still contain the content, so the drop succeeds. Now
the content has been lost.

# OPTIONS

* `--json`

  Enable JSON output. This is intended to be parsed by programs that use
  git-annex. Each line of output is a JSON object.

* `--json-error-messages`

  Messages that would normally be output to standard error are included in
  the JSON instead.

* Also the [[git-annex-common-options]](1) can be used.
