The git-annex assistant creates a synchronised folder on each of your
OSX and Linux computers, Android devices, removable drives, NAS appliances,
and cloud services. The contents of the folder are the same everywhere.
It's very easy to use, and has all the power of git and git-annex.

## installation

The git-annex assistant comes as part of git-annex. 
See [[install]] to get it installed.

See the [[release_notes]] for an overview of the status, and upgrade
instructions.
