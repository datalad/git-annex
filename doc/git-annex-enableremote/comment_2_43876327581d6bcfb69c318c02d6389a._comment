@Sundar, good question.

`git annex enableremote` will always refuse to enable the remote if there's
a missing parameter, and prompt for the parameter. Finding the right value
is up to you. Most of the time, no additional parameters are needed, or
the parameters are fairly self-explanatory, eg login passwords for remote
services.

The difficulty with directory special remotes is that my /foo may not be
the same as your /foo, so it can't reuse the directory= that was provided
to initremote, and it's up to you to enter the right directory path.

I think this needs to come down to documentation in the repository. The
description of the remote (set by `git annex describe` 
is a reasonable place to put that, unless you have somewhere better.
