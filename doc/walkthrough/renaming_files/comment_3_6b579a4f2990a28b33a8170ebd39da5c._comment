This is basically the same as thinking that git should change the SHA1
used to refer to a file in the repository just because it was renamed.
That does not normally make sense.

Including the original extension in the git-annex key is done to avoid
confusing some poorly-behaved programs that expect to follow the symlink
and find a file with an extension. It's best to ignore the extension part
of the key, or if you like, you can change the [[backend|doc/backends]] from SHA256E to
SHA256, and then new keys won't include that extension.
