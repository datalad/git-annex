Tom, it should suffice for your colleague to pull the new
version from you, and then run `git annex unused` to find unused files.

Now, if you have other branches or tags pointing at older versions
of the data, those files will still be considered to be used, even if 
the current version doesn't use them. There's a new
`--used-refspec` option for [[git-annex unused|git-annex-unused]] that 
you can use to specify which branches to consider to be used.
