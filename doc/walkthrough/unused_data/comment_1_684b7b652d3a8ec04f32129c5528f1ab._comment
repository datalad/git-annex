Sometimes links to annexed data still exists on some branch, when it was supposed to be dropped. Here is how I found these; perhaps there is a simpler way.

    % git annex find --format '${key}\n' | sort > /tmp/known-keys
    % find .git/annex/objects -type f -exec basename {} \; | sort  > /tmp/local-keys
    % comm -23 /tmp/local-keys /tmp/known-keys

to look for what branch these are on, try 

    % git log --stat --all -S$key

for one of the keys output above. In my case it was the same remote branch keeping them all alive.


*EDIT* sort key lists to make comm work properly
