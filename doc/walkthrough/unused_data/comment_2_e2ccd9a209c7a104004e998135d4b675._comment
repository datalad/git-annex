Is there an easy solution for the following? There are two kinds of \"unused\" I would like to treat differently:

1. Kind \"really unused\": Was added once to the annex, but symlink was never committed
2. Kind \"only history\": A commit contains a symlink to the data, but no active branch

I want to preserve \"only history\", and only drop \"really unused\". What is an elegant way to do this? Thanks for your suggestions.
