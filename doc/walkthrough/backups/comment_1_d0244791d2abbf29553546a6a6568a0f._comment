Sure, git-annex prevents me from dropping files unless there are numcopies around elsewhere, but shouldn't it also ensure that numcopies cannot be set unless that requirement is already met?

Furthermore, shouldn't it ensure that when new files are added, they are automatically distributed to fulfill the requirement?
