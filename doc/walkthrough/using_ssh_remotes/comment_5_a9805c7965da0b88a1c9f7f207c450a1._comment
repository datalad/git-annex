Hi,

I guess the problem is with git-annex-shell. I tried to do 'git annex get file --from name_ssh_repo', and I got the following:

bash: git-annex-shell: command not found; failed; exit code 127

The same thing happens if I try to do 'git annex whereis'

git-annex-shell is indeed installed. How can I make my shell recognize this command?

Thanks a lot!
