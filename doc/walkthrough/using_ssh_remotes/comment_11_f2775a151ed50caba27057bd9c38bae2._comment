Thanks Matthias, I fought with this as well, this was the tip I needed to move on.  I'm using the Linux standalone, and I had 2 issues getting everything to work without getting git-annex-shell errors.

1. The autoinstalled wrapper could not be found, I had to comment the \"Ubuntu exit\" line and add the $HOME/.ssh to path to get rid of \"command not found\"
2. Had to modify the wrapper by replacing the \"$SSH_ORIGINAL_COMMAND\" by \"$@\" to get rid of \"fatal: unrecognized command ''\"
