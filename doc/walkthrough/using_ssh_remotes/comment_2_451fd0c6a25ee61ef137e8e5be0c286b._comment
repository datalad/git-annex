Hi,

I could successfully clone my ssh repo's annex to my laptop, following these instructions.
I'm also able to sync the repositories (laptop and ssh) when I commit new files in the ssh repo.

However, every time I try to get files from the ssh repo (using 'git annex get some_file'), nothing happens.
Do you know what can be happening?

Thanks!
