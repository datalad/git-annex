When `git annex get` does nothing, it's because it doesn't know a place to get the file from.

This can happen if the `git-annex` branch has not propigated from the place where the file was added.
For example, if on the laptop you had run `git pull ssh master`, that would only pull the master branch, not the git-annex branch. 

An easy way to ensure the git-annex branch is kept in sync is to run `git annex sync`
