Thanks for the quick replay!

I already did 'git annex sync', but it didn't work. The steps were: 'git clone ssh...', then 'cd annex', then 'git annex init \"laptop\"'

After that, I did a 'git annex sync', and tried to get the file, but nothing happens. That's why I found it weird.
Any other thing that might have happened?

Thanks again!
