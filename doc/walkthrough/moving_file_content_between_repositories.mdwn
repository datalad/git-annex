Often you will want to move some file contents from a repository to some
other one. For example, your laptop's disk is getting full; time to move
some files to an external disk before moving another file from a file
server to your laptop. Doing that by hand (by using `git annex get` and
`git annex drop`) is possible, but a bit of a pain. `git annex move`
makes it very easy.

	# git annex move my_cool_big_file --to usbdrive
	move my_cool_big_file (to usbdrive...) ok
	# git annex move video/hackity_hack_and_kaxxt.mov --from fileserver
	move video/hackity_hack_and_kaxxt.mov (from fileserver...)
