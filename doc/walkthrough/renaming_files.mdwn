You can use any normal git operations to move files around, or even
make copies or delete them.

Notice that, since annexed files are represented by symlinks,
the symlink will break when the file is moved into a subdirectory.
But, git-annex will fix this up for you when you commit --
it has a pre-commit hook that watches for and corrects broken symlinks.

(Note that if a repository is in direct mode, you can't run normal git
commands in it. Instead, just move the files using non-git commands, and
`git annex add` and `git annex sync`.)
