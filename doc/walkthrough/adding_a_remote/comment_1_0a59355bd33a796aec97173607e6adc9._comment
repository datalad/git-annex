After doing the above with two required copy per file, `git annex fsck` complained that I had only one copy per file even though I had created my clone, already. Once I `git pull`ed from the second repo, not getting any changes for obvious reasons, `git annex fsck` was happy. So I am not sure how my addition was incorrect. -- RichiH
