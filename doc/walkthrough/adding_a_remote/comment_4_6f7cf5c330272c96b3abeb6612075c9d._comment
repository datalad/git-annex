Good spotting on the last line, fixed.

The laptop remote is indeed redundant, but it leads to clearer views of what is going on later in the walkthrough (\"git pull laptop master\", \"(copying from laptop...)\"). And if the original clone is made from a central bare repo, this reinforces that you'll want to set up remotes for other repos on the computer.
