Another [[special_remote|special_remotes]] that git-annex can use is
a [[special_remotes/bup]] repository. Bup stores large file contents
in a git repository of its own, with deduplication. Combined with
git-annex, you can have git on both the frontend and the backend.

Here's how to create a bup remote, and describe it.

[[!template id=note text="""
Instead of specifying a remote system, you could choose to make a bup
remote that is only accessible on the current system, by passing
"buprepo=/big/mybup".
"""]]

	# git annex initremote mybup type=bup encryption=none buprepo=example.com:/big/mybup
	initremote bup (bup init)
	Initialized empty Git repository in /big/mybup/
	ok
	# git annex describe mybup "my bup repository at example.com"
	describe mybup ok

Now the remote can be used like any other remote.

	# git annex move my_cool_big_file --to mybup
	move my_cool_big_file (to mybup...)
	Receiving index from server: 1100/1100, done.
	ok

Note that, unlike other remotes, bup does not really support removing
content from its git repositories. This is a feature. :)

	# git annex move my_cool_big_file --from mybup
	move my_cool_big_file (from mybup...)
	  content cannot be removed from bup remote
	failed
	git-annex: 1 failed

See [[special_remotes/bup]] for details.
