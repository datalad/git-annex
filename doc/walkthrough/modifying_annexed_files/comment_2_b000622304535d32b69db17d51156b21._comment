ATM unlock copies original file for modifications, so that original copy remains under annex and possibly to-be-edited copy created.
But if I am \"unlock\"ing file I might simply not be interested in a previous copy and want to maintain only a single (possibly edited) new copy.
What if there was a mode where the actual file is simply moved into \"unlocked\" location for editing, thus effectively dropping the actual content from git annex.  That would allow to not inquire lengthy copying/wasting local space.  If then I would need a previous copy I would just \"get\" it again.
