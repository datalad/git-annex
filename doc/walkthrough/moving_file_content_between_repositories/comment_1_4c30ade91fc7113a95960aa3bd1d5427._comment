I may be missing something obvious, but when I copy to a remote repository, the object files are created, but no softlinks are created. When I pull everything from the remote, it pulls only files the local repo knows about already.

        A
       / \
      B   C

Moving from B to A creates no symlinks in A but the object files are moved to A. Copying back from A to B restores the object files in B and keeps them in A.

Copying from A to an empty C does not create any object files nor symlinks. Copying from C to A creates no symlinks in A but the object files are copied to A.
