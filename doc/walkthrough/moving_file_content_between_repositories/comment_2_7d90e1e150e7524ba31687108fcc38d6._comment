`git annex move` only moves content. All symlink management is handled by git, so you have to keep repositories in sync using git as you would any other repo. When you `git pull B` in A, it will get whatever symlinks were added to B.

(It can be useful to use a central bare repo and avoid needing to git pull from one repo to another, then you can just always push commits to the central repo, and pull down all changes from other repos.)
