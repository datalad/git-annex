Ah yes, I feel kinda stupid in hindsight.

As the central server is most likely a common use case, would you object if I added that to the walkthrough? If you have any best practices on how to automate a push with every copy to a bare remote? AFAIK, git does not store information about bare/non-bare remotes, but this could easily be put into .git/config by git annex.
