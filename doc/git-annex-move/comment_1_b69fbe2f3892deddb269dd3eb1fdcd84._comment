It would be awesome to be able to move (or copy) between remotes, 
eg. `git annex copy --from=remote-a --to=remote-b`

Use case: I have a repo of ~1TB, but only ~30GB free disk space on my laptop. Currently I have to manually `get` and `move` the files almost one by one to get them from one remote to the other.
