I guess you guys with the badly limited filename lenghs are using encfs or
something like that. encfs is [really shoddy](https://defuse.ca/audits/encfs.htm),
and I feel kind of like someone is complaining that the git repo can't be
checked out on MS-DOS. 
8.3 filenames are so 1985, and 128 filenames are so.. 1995?
