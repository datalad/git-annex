Trying to run this release on OSX results in an error message from Gatekeeper:

> \"git-annex\" can't be opened because it is from an unidentified developer.
> 
> Your security preferences allow installation of only apps from the Mac App Store and identified developers.

It would be nice if the binary could be signed to make Gatekeeper happy. Until then a note in the installation instructions might be useful.
