I'm trying to get local pairing working between two local machines (same switch, both connected via cat5 cables) and they're not seeing each other, though I can happily ssh from one box to the other.

In order to eliminate possible sources of problems, I tried these insecure settings:

* add a `-A INPUT -j ACCEPT` to the top of my firewall rules
* use `password` as the shared secret

but I still can't get past \"pairing in progress\" when pairing with a \"Local computer\".

Is there any way to get information as to where the two machines are failing to see one another?
