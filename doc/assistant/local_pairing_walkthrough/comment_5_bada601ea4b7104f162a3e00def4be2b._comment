I hadn't thought of ssh. So here's what I've got now:

* both laptop and desktop have `-A INPUT -d 224.0.0.251/32 -p udp --dport 55556 -j ACCEPT`
* `git annex webapp` is running as user `francois` on both machines
* laptop has `openssh-server` running on port 22 and its firewall allows desktop to connect
* desktop has `openssh-server` running on port 22 and its firewall allows the whole internal network to connect
* laptop's ssh pubkey is in francois' `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` on desktop and ssh'ing works
* deskop's ssh pubkey is **not** in francois' `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` on laptop (is that required?)
* (as mentioned before) both desktop and laptop are on the same switch and connected over CAT5
* I'm using `password` as a pairing key just to rule out any typos there

I don't see anything in the git-annex log on both of these machines. There's just a bunch of key generation stuff and then the last line is \"Pairing in progress\".
