It'll prompt you to set up a folder:

Then any changes you make to its folder will automatically be committed to
git, and synced to repositories on other computers. You can use the
interface to add repositories and control the git-annex assistant.

## starting on boot

The git-annex assistant will automatically be started when you log in to
desktop environments like Mac OS X, Gnome, XFCE, and KDE, and the menu item
shown above can be used to open the webapp. On other systems, you may need
to start it by hand.

To start the webapp, run `git annex webapp` at the command line.

To start the assistant without opening the webapp, 
you can run the command "git annex assistant --autostart". This is a
good thing to configure your system to run automatically when you log in.
