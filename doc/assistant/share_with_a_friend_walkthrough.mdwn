Want to share all the files in your repository securely with a friend?

This connects to your friend's repository using
[Tor](https://torproject.org/). Both you and your friend will need to
install [Tor](https://torproject.org/) and
[Magic Wormhole](https://github.com/warner/magic-wormhole), and then both
follow these steps to connect your repositories.

Start by opening up your git annex webapp.

`*click*`

You will probably be prompted to enter a password, to configure Tor.
(Depending on how your system is configured, this may be the root password,
or your user account's password.)

A pairing code will be generated. Tell it to your friend. Ask them
for their pairing code, and enter it in the form.

Once you've exchanged pairing codes, your repositories will be connected
over Tor. They will begin to sync files back and forth, which can take a
while since Tor is not super-fast.
