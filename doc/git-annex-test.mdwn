# NAME

git-annex test - run built-in test suite

# SYNOPSIS

git annex test

# DESCRIPTION

This runs git-annex's built-in test suite.

The test suite runs in the `.t` subdirectory of the current directory.

It can be useful to run the test suite on different filesystems,
or to verify your local installation of git-annex.

# OPTIONS
      
There are several options, provided by Haskell's tasty test
framework. Pass --help for details about those.

* `--jobs=N` `-JN`

  How many tests to run in parallel. The default is "cpus", which will
  runs one job per CPU core.

* `--keep-failures`

  When there are test failures, leave the `.t` directory populated with
  repositories that demonstate the failures, for later analysis.

* `--test-git-config name=value`

  The test suite prevents git from reading any git configuration files.
  Usually it is a good idea to run the test suite with a standard 
  git configuration. However, this option can be useful to see what
  effect a git configuration setting has on the test suite. 

  Some configuration settings will break the test suite, in ways that are
  due to a bug in git-annex. But it is possible that changing a
  configuration can find a legitimate bug in git-annex.

  One valid use of this is to change a git configuration to a value that
  is planned to be the new default in a future version of git.
