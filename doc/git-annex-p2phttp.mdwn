# NAME

git-annex-p2phttp - HTTP server for git-annex P2P protocol

# SYNOPSIS

git-annex p2phttp

# DESCRIPTION

This allows a git-annex repository to be accessed over HTTP.
It is the git-annex equivilant of git-http-backend(1), for serving
a repository over HTTP with write access for authenticated users.

# OPTIONS

* `--port=N`

  Port to listen on. Default is port 80.

* `--authenv`

  Allows users to be authenticated with a username and password.
  For security, this only allows authentication when the user connects over
  HTTPS.

  To configure the passwords, set environment variables
  like `GIT_ANNEX_P2PHTTP_PASSWORD_alice=foo123`

  The permissions of users can also be configured by setting
  environment variables like 
  `GIT_ANNEX_P2PHTTP_PERMISSIONS_alice=readonly`. The value
  can be either "readonly" or "appendonly". When this is not set,
  the default is to give the user full write access.

* `--authenv-http`

  Like `--authenv`, but allows authentication when the user connects
  over HTTP. This is not secure, since HTTP basic authentication is not
  encrypted.

* `--unauth-readonly`

  Allows unauthenticated users to read the repository, but not make
  modifications to it.

* `--unauth-appendonly`

  Allows unauthenticated users to read the repository, and store data in
  it, but not remove data from it.

* `--wideopen`

  Gives unauthenticated users full read+write access to the repository.

  Please think carefully before enabling this option.
