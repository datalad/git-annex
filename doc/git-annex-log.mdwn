# NAME

git-annex log - shows location log information

# SYNOPSIS

git annex log `[path ...]`

# DESCRIPTION

This command displays information from the history of the git-annex branch. 

Several things can prevent that information being available to display.
When [[git-annex-forget]] is used, old historical
data gets cleared from the branch. When annex.private or
remote.name.annex-private is configured, git-annex does not write
information to the branch at all. And when annex.alwayscommit is set to
false, information may not have been committed to the branch yet.

# OPTIONS

* `[path ...]`

  Displays the location log for the specified file or files, showing each
  repository they were added to ("+") and removed from ("-"). Note that
  it displays information about the file content currently at these paths,
  not for any different content that was there in earlier commits.

* matching options
  
  The [[git-annex-matching-options]](1)
  can be used to control what to act on when displaying the location log
  for specified files.

* `--all` `-A`

  Shows location log changes to all content, with the most recent changes first.
  In this mode, the names of files are not available and keys are displayed
  instead.

* `--sizesof=repository`

  Displays a history of the total size of the annexed files in a repository
  as it changed over time from the creation of the repository to the present.

  The repository can be "here" for the current repository, or the name of a
  remote, or a repository description or uuid.

  Note that keys that do not have a known size are not included in the
  total.

* `--sizes`

  This is like --sizesof, but rather than display the size of a single
  repository, it displays the sizes of all known repositories.

  The output is a CSV formatted table.

* `--totalsizes`

  This is like `--sizesof`, but it displays the total size of all
  known repositories.

* `--interval=time`

  When using `--sizesof`, `--sizes`, and `--totalsizes`, this 
  controls the minimum interval between displays of the size.
  The default is to display each recorded change to the size.

  The time is of the form "30d" or "1y".

* `--since=date`, `--after=date`, `--until=date`, `--before=date`, `--max-count=N`

  These options are passed through to `git log`, and can be used to limit
  how far back to search for location log changes.
  
  For example: `--since "1 month ago"`

  These options do not have an affect when using `--sizesof`, `--sizes`, 
  and `--totalsizes`.

* `--bytes`

  Show sizes in bytes, disabling the default nicer units.

* `--raw-date`

  Rather than the normal display of a date in the local time zone,
  displays seconds since the unix epoch.

* `--gource`

  Generates output suitable for the `gource` visualization program.
  
  This option does not have an affect when using `--sizesof`, `--sizes`, 
  and `--totalsizes`.

* `--json`

  Enable JSON output. This is intended to be parsed by programs that use
  git-annex. Each line of output is a JSON object.
  
  This option does not have an affect when using `--sizesof`, `--sizes`, 
  and `--totalsizes`.

* `--json-error-messages`

  Messages that would normally be output to standard error are included in
  the JSON instead.
  
  This option does not have an affect when using `--sizesof`, `--sizes`, 
  and `--totalsizes`.

* Also the [[git-annex-common-options]](1) can be used.
