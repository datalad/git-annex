Some folks have built other software on top of git-annex, or that is
designed to interoperate with it.

* The [[git-annex assistant|assistant]] is included in git-annex,
  and extends its use cases into new territory.
 
* [gitlab-shell](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-shell) supports
  git-annex. So git-annex can be used with repositories served by GitLab,
  including gitlab.com, or deploy your own.
  [See GitLab's announcement](https://about.gitlab.com/2015/02/17/gitlab-annex-solves-the-problem-of-versioning-large-binaries-with-git/)

* Emacs Org mode can auto-commit attached files to git-annex.

* [git annex darktable integration](https://github.com/xxv/darktable-git-annex)

* [Magit](http://github.com/magit/magit), an Emacs mode for Git, has
  [an extension](https://github.com/magit/magit-annex) for git annex.

* [git-annex-metadata-gui](https://github.com/alpernebbi/git-annex-metadata-gui)
  is a GUI for editing the metadata. An easier alternative to using
  [[git-annex-metadata]] at the command line.

* [DataLad](http://datalad.org/) uses git-annex to provide access to
  scientific data available from various sources.

* The [Baob√°xia](https://github.com/RedeMocambos/baobaxia) project
  built by the Brazilian [Mocambos network](http://www.mocambos.net/)
  is [using git-annex to connect isolated communities](http://www.modspil.dk/itpolitik/baob_xia.html).
  Repositories sync over satellite internet and/or sneakernet.

* The [Isuma Media Players project](http://isuma-media-players.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html)
  uses git-annex to "create a two-way, distributed content distribution
  network for communities with poor connexions to the internet".

* [The Japanese American Legacy Project](http://www.densho.org/)
  uses git-annex to manage upwards of 100 terabytes of collections,
  transporting them from small cultural heritage sites on USB drives.
  User interface is a [Django web app](https://github.com/densho).

* [[forum/gadu_-_git-annex_disk_usage]] is a du like utility that
  is git-annex aware.

* [sizes](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/sizes) is another du-like
  utility, with a `-A` switch that enables git-annex support.

* [git-annex-watcher](https://github.com/rubiojr/git-annex-watcher)
  is a status icon for your desktop.

* [git-annex-adaptor](https://github.com/alpernebbi/git-annex-adapter)
  is a python interface to git-annex.
