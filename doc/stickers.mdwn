Hexagonal sticker design using the [[logo]] with add-on tiles to expand
the annex.

This complies with <https://github.com/terinjokes/StickerConstructorSpec/>
and so is intended to combine with other hexagonal stickers.

Some of the add-on tiles contain enough white-space to add other art work
as desired.

It includes some smaller tiles that can bridge between hexagonal and
square/regtangular stickers, as illustrated in
<https://github.com/terinjokes/StickerConstructorSpec/issues/13>.

License: Same as git-annex [[logo]]; Joey would appreciate spare 
git-annex stickers mailed his way, but does not require it. ;)
