Recent work has included improving `fsck --from remote` (and fixing a
reversion caused by the relative path changes in January), and making
annex.diskreserve be checked in more cases. And added a `git annex
required` command for setting [[required_content]].

Also, I want to thank several people for their work:

* Roy sent a patch to enable http proxy support.. despite
  having only learned some haskell by "30 mins with YAHT". I investigated
  that more, and no patch is actually necessary, but just a newer version
  of the http-client library.
* CandyAngel has been posting lots of helpful comments on the website,
  including [this tip](http://git-annex.branchable.com/forum/__34__git_annex_sync__34___synced_after_8_hours/#comment-890ca1381d800ac833ccbb8c5db175ea)
  that significantly speeds up a large git repository.
* Ã˜yvind fixed a lot of typos throughout the git-annex
  documentation.
* Yaroslav has created a `git-annex-standalone.deb` package
  that will work on any system where debian packages can be installed,
  no matter how out of date it is (within reason), using the same
  methods as the standalone tarball.
