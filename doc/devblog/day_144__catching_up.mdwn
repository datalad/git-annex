Got caught up on all recent bugs and questions, although I still have a
backlog of 27 older things that I really should find time for.

Fixed a couple of bugs. One was that the assistant set up ssh
`authorized_keys` that didn't work with the fish shell.

Also got caught up on the current state of telehash-c. Have not quite
gotten it to work, but it seems pretty close to being able to see it do
something useful for the first time.

Pushing out a release this evening with a good number of changes left over
from March.
