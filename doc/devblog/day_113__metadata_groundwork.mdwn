Built the core data types, and log for metadata storage. Making metadata
union merge well is tricky, but I have a design I'm happy with, that will
allow distributed changes to metadata.

Finished up the day with a `git annex metadata` command to get/set metadata
for a file.

This is all the goundwork needed to begin experimenting with generating
git branches that display different metadata-driven views of annexed files.
