Please announce that deprecation well in advance, though. I feel your pain and have started to migrate to an S3->Glacier setup myself, but getting data out of Glacier is fairly expensive if done quickly. 

(And due to git-annex' ease of adding more data, I got a fairly large amount of backups, and would also prefer not to be stuck on an old version of git-annex just for Glacier support.)
