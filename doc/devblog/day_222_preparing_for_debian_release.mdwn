Made two releases of git-annex, yesterday and today, which turned out to
contain only Debian changes. So no need for other users to upgrade.

This included fixing building on mips, and arm architectures.
The mips build was running out of memory, and I was able to work around
that. Then the arm builds broke today, because of a recent change to the
version of llvm that has completely trashed ghc. Luckily, I was able
to work around that too.

Hopefully that will get last week's security fix into Debian testing,
and otherwise have git-annex in Debian in good shape for the upcoming
freeze.
