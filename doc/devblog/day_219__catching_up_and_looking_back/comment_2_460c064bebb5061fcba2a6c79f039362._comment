thanks so much for your work on git-annex, joeyh. it's hard to imagine that just 4 years ago, we didn't have anything even close to this tool and how far it went since then.

birthday is coming soon! :)

it's also quite impressive how much work can be done in a single year with some (fairly minimal) funding to dedicate a full dev on a project. very inspiring - keep up the good work! -- [[anarcat]]
