The tricky part of the `git annex export` feature has definitely been
making it work in a distributed situation. The last details of that seem to
have been worked out now.

I had to remove support for dropping individual files from export remotes.
The [[design|design/exporting_trees_to_special_remotes]] has a scenario
where that makes distributed use of exports inconsistent.

But, what is working now is `git annex export` being run in one repository,
and then another repository, after syncing, can get files from the export.

Most of export is done now. The only thing I'm thinking about adding is
a way to make an export track a branch. so `git annex sync` can update
the export.
