Spent the day testing the sshpasswd branch. A few interesting things:

* I was able to get rid of 10 lines of Windows specific code for
  rsync.net, which had been necessary for console ssh password prompting to
  work. Yay!
* git-remote-gcrypt turned out to be broken when there is no controlling
  tty. --no-tty has to be passed to gpg to avoid it falling over in this
  case, even when a gpg agent is available to be used. I fixed this with
  a new release of git-remote-gcrypt.

Mostly the new branch just worked! And is merged...

Merged a patch from Robie Basak that adds a new special remote that's sort
of like bup but supports deletion: [[special_remotes/ddar]]

Backlog: 172

Today's work was sponsored by Andrew Cant.
