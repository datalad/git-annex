Pushed out a minor release of git-annex today, mostly to fix build problems
on Debian. No strong reason to upgrade to it otherwise.

Continued where I left off with the Git.Destroyer. Fixed quite a lot of
edge cases where git repair failed due to things like a corrupted .git/HEAD
file (this makes git think it's not in a git repository), corrupt
git objects that have an unknown object type and so crash git hard, and
an interesting failure mode where git fsck wants to allocate 116 GB of
memory due to a corrupted object size header. Reported that last to the git
list, as well as working around it.

At the end of the day, I ran a test creating 10000 corrupt git
repositories, and **all** of them were recovered! Any improvements will
probably involve finding new ways to corrupt git repositories that my code
can't think of. ;)
