The new annex.securehashesonly config setting prevents annexed content
that does not use a cryptographically secure hash from being downloaded or
otherwise added to a repository.

Using that and signed commits prevents SHA1 collisions from causing
problems with annexed files. See [[tips/using_signed_git_commits]] for
details about how to use it, and why I believe it makes git-annex
safe despite git's vulnerability to SHA1 collisions in general.

If you are using git-annex to publish binary files in a repository,
you should follow the instructions in [[tips/using_signed_git_commits]].

If you're using git to publish binary files, you can improve the security
of your repository by switchingto git-annex and signed commits.
