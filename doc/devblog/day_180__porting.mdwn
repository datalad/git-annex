Did work on Windows porting today. First, fixed a reversion in the last
release, that broke the git-annex branch pretty badly on Windows, causing
\r to be written to files on that branch that should never have DOS line
endings. Second, fixed a long-standing bug that prevented getting a file
from a local bare repository on Windows.

Also refreshed all autobuilders to deal with the gnutls and openssl
security holes-of-the-week. (git-annex uses gnutls only for XMPP,
and does not use openssl itself, but a few programs bundled with it,
like curl, do use openssl.)

A nice peice of news: OSX Homebrew now contains git-annex, so it can be
easily installed with `brew install git-annex`
