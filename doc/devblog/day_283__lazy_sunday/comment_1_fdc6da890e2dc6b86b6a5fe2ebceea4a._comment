I'd be interested to hear your reasons for preferring tabs over spaces, if it's anything more than an aesthetic preference.

The [GHC trac](https://ghc.haskell.org/trac/ghc/ticket/9230) suggests that it was turned on by default because beginners accidentally mix tabs and spaces and get very confused.
