Spent basically all of today getting the assistant to be able to handle
gcrypt special remotes that already exist when it's told to add a USB
drive. This was quite tricky! And I did have to skip handling gcrypt repos
that are not git-annex special remotes.

Anyway, it's now almost easy to set up an encrypted sneakernet 
using a USB drive and some computers running the webapp. The only part
that the assistant doesn't help with is gpg key management.

Plan is to make a release on Friday, and then try to also add support for
encrypted git repositories on remote servers. Tomorrow I will try to get
through some of the communications backlog that has been piling up while I
was head down working on gcrypt.
