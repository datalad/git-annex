Debian's tor daemon is very locked down in the directories it can read
from, and so I've had a hard time finding a place to put the unix socket
file for git-annex's tor hidden service. Painful details in 
<http://bugs.debian.org/846275>. At least for now, I'm putting it under
/etc/tor/, which is probably a FHS violation, but seems to be the only
option that doesn't involve a lot of added complexity.

The Windows autobuilder is moving, since
[NEST](http://nest-initiative.org/) is shutting down the server it has been
using. Yury Zaytsev has set up a new Windows autobuilder, hosted at
Dartmouth College this time.
