Why does matching by mimetype only make sense for annex.largefiles, but not for preferred content expressions? Sorry if this is a stupid question, but it seems it would in fact be quite useful to easily express that, for example, a certain repo have a preference for my photos and not my music files (though both should be considered large files)
