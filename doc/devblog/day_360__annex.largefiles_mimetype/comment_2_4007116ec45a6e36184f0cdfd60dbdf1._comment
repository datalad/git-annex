Yeah! I've waited for this option for a half a year :-)  Thumbs up for finally including it!

Doesn't work out of the box, though; I do have the MagicMime build flag but it fails to add files now!

I get this error message for every file I try to add:

    /etc/magic, 0: Warning: using regular magic file `/usr/share/misc/magic'
    
    git-annex: user error (magicLoadDefault: could not find any valid magic files!)
    failed
