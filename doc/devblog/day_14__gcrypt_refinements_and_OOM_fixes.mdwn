Spent a few hours improving gcrypt in some minor ways, including adding a
--check option that the assistant can use to find out if a given repo is
encrypted with dgit, and also tell if the necessary gpg key is available to
decrypt it. Also merged in a fix to support subkeys, developed by a
git-annex user who is the first person I've heard from who is using gcrypt.
I don't want to maintain gcrypt, so I am glad its author has shown up
again today.

Got mostly caught up on backlog. The main bug I was able to track down
today is git-annex using a lot of memory in certian repositories. This
turns out to have happened when a really large file was committed right
intoo to the git repository (by mistake or on purpose). Some parts of
git-annex buffer file contents in memory while trying to work out if
they're git-annex keys. Fixed by making it first check if a file in git is
marked as a symlink. Which was really hard to do!

At least 4 people ran into this bug, which makes me suspect that lots of
people are messing up when using direct mode (probably due to not reading
the documentation, or having `git commit -a` hardwired into their fingers,
and forcing git to commit large files into their repos, rather than having
git-annex manage them. Implementing [[todo/direct_mode_guard]] seems more
urgent now.
