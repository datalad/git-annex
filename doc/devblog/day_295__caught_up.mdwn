Now caught up on nearly all of my backlog of messages, 
and indeed am getting to some messages that have been waiting for months.
Backlog is down to 113! Couple of bugfixes resulted, and many questions answered.

Think I'll spend a couple more days dealing with the older part of the
backlog. Then, when that reaches diminishing returns, I'll move on to some
big change. I have been thinking about [[design/caching_database]] on and
off..
