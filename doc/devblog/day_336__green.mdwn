Test suite is 100% green! Fixed one remaining bug it found, and solved the
strange sqlite crash, which turned out to be caused by the test suite deleting
its temporary repository before sqlite was done with the database inside it.

The only remaining blocker for using v6 unlocked files is a bad interaction
with shared clones. That should be easy to fix, so release of git-annex
version 6 is now not far away!

While I've only talked about v6/[[smudge]] stuff here lately, I have been
fixing various other bugs along the way, and have accumulated a dozen bug
fixes since the last release. Earlier this week I fixed a bug in `git annex
unused`. Yesterday I noticed that `git annex migrate` didn't copy over
metadata. Today, fixed a crash of `git annex view` in a non-unicode locale.
Etc. So it'll be good not to have the release blocked any longer by v6
stuff.
