Finished the repository-clone-global configuration settings I started
adding on Monday. Came up with a nice type-driven way to make sure
that configuration is loaded when needed, and only loaded once.
Then it was easy to make annex.autocommit be configurable by git-annex
config. Also added a new annex.synccontent configuration, which can also be
set by git-annex config.

Also resolved a tricky situation with providing an appid to magic wormhole.
It will happen on a flag day in 2021. I've marked my calendar..
