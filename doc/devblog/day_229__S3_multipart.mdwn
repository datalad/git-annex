Some progress on the [[bugs/S3_upload_not_using_multipart]] bug. The aws
library now includes the multipart API. However, when I dug into it, it
looks like the API needs some changes to get the ETAG of each uploaded
part. Once that's fixed, git-annex should be able to support S3 multipart
uploads, although I think that git-annex's own chunking is better in most
situations -- it supports resuming uploads and downloads better. The main
use case for S3 multipart seems to be using git-annex to publish large
files.

Also, managed to get the backlog down from 100 to just 65 messages,
including catching up on quite old parts of backlog.
