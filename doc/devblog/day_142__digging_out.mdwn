Catching up on conference backlog. 36 messages backlog remains.

Fixed `git-annex-shell configlist` to automatically initialize a
git remote when a git-annex branch had been pushed to it. This is necessary
for gitolite to be easy to use, and I'm sure it used to work.

Updated the Debian backport and made a Debian package of the
fdo-notify haskell library used for notifications.

Applied a patch from Alberto Berti to fix support for tahoe-lafs
1.10.

And various other bug fixes and small improvements.
