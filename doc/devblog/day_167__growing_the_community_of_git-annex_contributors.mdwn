Released git-annex 5.20140517 today. The changelog for this release
is very unusual, because it's full of contributions from others! There are
as many patches from others in this release as git-annex got in the first
entire two years of its existence.

I'd like to keep that going. Also, I could really use help triaging bug
reports right now. So I have updated the **[[contribute]]** page with more
info about easy ways to contribute to git-annex. If you read this devblog,
you're an ideal contributor, and you don't need to know how to write
haskell either.. So take a [[look at the page|contribute]] and see if
you can help out.
