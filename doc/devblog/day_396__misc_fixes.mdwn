A productive day of small fixes. Including a change to deal with an
incompatability in git 2.9's commit.gpgsign, and couple of fixes
involving gcrypt repositories.

Also several improvements to cloning from repositories where an adjusted
branch is checked out. The clone automatically ends up with the adjusted
branch checked out too.

The test suite has 3 failures when run on a FAT repository, all involving
adjusted branches. Managed to fix one of them today, hope to get to the
others soon.
