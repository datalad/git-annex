A while ago I needed a tool to emulate slow IO (low bandwidth and high latency). I ended writing a small FUSE driver (in Go, just for fun) that did this by adding some delay to each function call. Hacky, but simpler than setting up a device mapper or NBD. I guess you could also emulate IO errors with something like this. If you're interested I can clean up my code and push it to a public repo.
