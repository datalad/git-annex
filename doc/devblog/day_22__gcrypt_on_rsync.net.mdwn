Being still a little unsure of the UI and complexity
for configuring gcrypt on ssh servers, I thought I'd start today with the
special case of gcrypt on rsync.net. Since rsync.net allows running some git
commands, gcrypt can be used to make encrypted git repositories on it.

Here's the UI I came up with. It's complicated a bit by needing to explain
the tradeoffs between the rsync and gcrypt special remotes.

This works fine, but I did not get a chance to add support for enabling
existing gcrypt repos on rsync.net. Anyway, most of the changes to make
this work will also make it easier to add general support for gcrypt on ssh
servers.

Also spent a while fixing a bug in git-remote-gcrypt. Oddly 
`gpg --list-keys --fast-list --fingerprint` does not show the fingerprints
of some keys.

Today's work was sponsored by Cloudier - Thomas Dj√§rv.
