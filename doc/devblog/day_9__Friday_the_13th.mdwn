Worked to get git-remote-gcrypt included in every git-annex autobuild
bundle.
(Except Windows; running a shell script there may need some work later..)

Next I want to work on making the assistant easily able to create encrypted
git repositories on removable drives. Which will involve a UI to select
which gpg key to use, or creating (and backing up!) a gpg key.

But, I got distracted chasing down some bugs on Windows. These were
quite ugly; more direct mode mapping breakage which resulted in 
files not being accessible. Also fsck on Windows failed to detect and fix
the problem. All fixed now. (If you use git-annex on Windows, you should
certainly upgrade and run `git annex fsck`.)

As with most bugs in the Windows port, the underlying cause turned out to
be stupid: `isSymlink` always returned False on Windows. Which makes sense
from the perspective of Windows not quite having anything entirely like
symlinks. But failed when that was being used to detect when files in the
git tree being merged into the repository had the symlink bit set..

Did bug triage. Backlog down to 32 (mostly messages from August).
