git-annex has been using MissingH's `absNormPath` forever, but that's
not very maintained and doesn't work on Windows. I've been
wanting to get rid of it for some time, and finally did today, writing a
`simplifyPath` that does the things git-annex needs and will work with all
the Windows filename craziness, and takes advantage of the more modern
System.FilePath to be quite a simple peice of code. A QuickCheck test found
no important divergences from absNormPath. A good first step to making
git-annex not depend on MissingH at all. 

That fixed one last Windows bug that was disabled in the test suite:
`git annex add ..\subdir\file` will now work.

I am re-installing the Android autobuilder for 2 reasons: I noticed I had
accidentally lost a patch to make a library use the Android SSL cert directory,
and also a new version of GHC is very near to release and so it makes sense
to update.

Down to 38 messages in the backlog.
