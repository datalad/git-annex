Pushed out a release today, could not resist the leap day in the version
number, and also there were enough bug fixes accumulated to make it worth
doing.

I now have `git-annex sync` working inside adjusted branches, so pulls
get adjusted appropriately before being merged into the adjusted branch.
Seems to mostly work well, I did just find one bug in it though. Only
propigating adjusted commits remains to be done to finish my adjusted
branches prototype.
