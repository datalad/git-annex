Not a lot accomplished today. Some release prep, followed up to a few bug
reports.

Split git-annex's .git/annex/tmp into two directories. .git/annex/tmp will
now be used only for partially transferred objects, while
.git/annex/misctmp will be used for everything else. In particular this
allows symlinking .git/annex/tmp to a ram disk, if you want to do that.
(It's not possible for .git/annex/misctmp to be on a different filesystem
from the rest of the repository for various reasons.)

Beat on Windows XMPP for several more painful hours. Got all the haskell
bindings installed, except for gnuidn. And patched network-client-xmpp to
build without gnuidn. Have not managed to get it to link.
