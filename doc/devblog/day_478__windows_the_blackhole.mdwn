Good grief, I've spent another whole day on Windows porting issues.

Tested the new windows builds. Got win32 patched with terminateProcessId,
and got the windows build using that. Unfortunately this made stack not
incrementally rebuild very well, so Windows builds 
got very slow. ([Bug report](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/issues/2960))

Found and fixed an ugly bug with annex link generation on Windows,
which probably dates back to this spring. Code was comparing `"C:\"` with
`"C:/"` and thinking the drives were different, argh. Still waiting on
sloooow builds to test that.

There will probably be an almost Windows-dedicated release tomorrow. Only
"almost" because Sean T Parsons sent in some patches.
