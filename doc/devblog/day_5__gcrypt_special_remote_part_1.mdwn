About half way done with a gcrypt special remote. I can initremote it (the
hard part to get working), and can send files to it. Can't yet get files
back, or remove files, and only local repositories work so far, but this is
enough to know it's going to be pretty nice!

Did find one issue in gcrypt that I may need to develop a patch for:
