Did some work on Friday and Monday to let external special remotes be used
in a readonly mode. This lets files that are stored in the remote be
downloaded by git-annex without the user needing to install the 
external special remote program. For this to work, the external special
remote just has to tell git-annex the urls to use. This was developed in
collaboration with Benjamin Gilbert, who is developing
[gcsannex](https://github.com/bgilbert/gcsannex), a Google Cloud Storage
special remote.

Today, got caught up with recent traffic, including fixing a couple of
bugs. The backlog remains in the low 90's, which is a good place to be as I
prepare for my August vacation week in the SF Bay Area, followed by a week
for ICFP and the Haskell Symposium in Vancouver.
