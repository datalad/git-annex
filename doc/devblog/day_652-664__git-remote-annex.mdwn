The [Distribits](https://distribits.live/) conference was a wonderful
chance to meet with many scientific users of git-annex and learn about
amazing things they are doing with it.

After giving [my talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp8IeGXpRRI&list=PLEQHbPfpVqU6esVrgqjfYybY394XD2qf2&index=3),
titled "git annex is complete, right?", it turned out (spoilers) to not be
complete. Indeed, the
[very next talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQyfYzZbD2M&list=PLEQHbPfpVqU6esVrgqjfYybY394XD2qf2&index=4)
gave me a big idea that I have been working on for the past several weeks
and have merged into master today. Michael Hanke described his 
[git-remote-datalad-annex](https://github.com/datalad/datalad-next/blob/main/datalad_next/gitremotes/datalad_annex.py)
which lets git push, pull, and even clone from a git-annex special remote.

I immediately saw that this would be better implemented in git-annex, which
would let it use its internals rather than some of the hacky workarounds
Michael needed. Also, I saw that git bundles were a much better data
format to use, which would allow cheap incremental git pushes.

At the Distribits hackathon, I got together with Michael and Timothy
Sanders, and we thought through the data format to store on special remotes.
We ended up with a quite simple data design, which can be used without
git-annex if necessary. (See [[internals/git-remote-annex]].)

Getting git bundles to work right, especially incremental bundles, and
dealing with all the quirks of git's gitremote-helper interface turned out
to be more challanging than I thought. I ended up spending a week
implementing a 
[prototype in shell script](http://source.git-annex.branchable.com/?p=source.git;a=blob;f=git-remote-annex.sh;h=2e818ed42016c7ea2044155d070a7901d34c75ba;hb=dfb09ad1ad99898591b50debebb4fb3d8215698b) 
to work through all the details. Then I had to reimplement it all in Haskell,
ending up with over 1000 lines of code.

The result is the [[git-remote-annex]], which will ship in the next
git-annex release. It should work with most types of special remotes,
including exporttree=yes ones (but not yet importtree=yes). But I've only
tested it on the directory special remote so far. It's really neat to be
able to git clone a repository from so many places, as well as
incrementally push changes.

There is a [[todo/git-remote-annex]] todo page, of which a lot of the remainder
is various race conditions when two people are pushing different things to the
same special remote at the same time. At least some of those will be dealt
with, for now I recommend only using git-remote-annex when you know you're the
only one pushing to a special remote.
