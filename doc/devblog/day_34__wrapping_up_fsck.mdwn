Fixed a lot of bugs in the assistant's fsck handling today, and merged
it into master. There are some enhancments that could be added to it, 
including fscking ssh remotes via git-annex-shell and adding the ability to
schedule events to run every 30 days instead of on a specific day of the
month. But enough on this feature for now.

Today's work was sponsored by Daniel Brockman.
