SÃ¶ren Brunk's massive bootstrap 3 patch has landed! This is a 43 thousand
line diff, with 2 thousand lines after the javascript and CSS libraries are
filtered out. Either way, the biggest patch contributed by anyone to
git-annex so far, and excellent work.

Meanwhile, I built a [[haskell program|design/assistant/syncing/simroutes.hs]] to simulate
a network of highly distributed git-annex nodes with ad-hoc connections and
the selective file syncing algorythm now documented at the bottom of
[[design/assistant/syncing/efficiency]].

Currently around 33% of requested files never get to their destination
in this simulation, but this is probably because its network is randomly
generated, and so contains disconnected islands. So next, some data entry,
from a map that involves an Amazon not in .com, dotted with names of people
I have recently met... :)
