Should mention that there was a release two days ago. The main reason for
the timing of that release is because the Linux wstandalone builds include
glibc, which recently had a nasty security hole and had to be updated.

Today, fixed a memory leak, and worked on getting caught up with backlog,
which now stands at 112 messages.
