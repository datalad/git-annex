Keeping lots of things going these past few days..

* Rebootstrapping the armel autobuilder with propellor. 
  Some qemu instability and the need to update haskell
  library patches meant this took a lot of hand-holding. Finally got a
  working setup today.
* Designing and ordering new git-annex stickers on clear viynl backing;
  have put off sending those to campaign contributors for too long.
* Added a new feature to the webapp: It now remembers the ssh remotes
  that it sets up, and makes it easy to enable them elsewhere, the same
  as other sorts of remotes. Had a very pleasant surprise building this,
  when I was able to reuse all the UI code for enabling rsync and gcrypt
  remotes. I think this will be a useful feature as we transition away
  from XMPP.
