Today was all about writing
[[tips/making_a_remote_repo_update_when_changes_are_pushed_to_it]].

That's a fairly simple page, because I added workarounds for all the
complexity of making it work in direct mode repos, adjusted branches, and
repos on filesystems not supporting executable git hooks. Basically,
the user should be able to set the standard
receive.denyCurrentBranch=updateInstead configuration on a remote, and 
then `git push` or `git annex sync` should update that remote's working tree.

There are a couple of unhandled cases; `git push` to a remote on a
filesystem like FAT won't update it, and `git annex sync` will only update
it if it's local, not accessed over ssh. Also, the emulation of git's
updateInstead behavior is not perfect for direct mode repos and adjusted
branches.

Still, it's good enough that most users should find it meets
their needs, I hope. How to set this kind of thing up is a fairly common
FAQ, and this makes it much simpler.

(Oh yeah, the first ancient kernel arm build is *still*
running. May finish before tomorrow.)
