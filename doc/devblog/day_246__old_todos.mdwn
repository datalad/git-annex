Got a release out today.

I'm feeling a little under the weather, so wanted something easy to do in
the rest of the day that would be nice and constructive. Ended up going
over the todo list. Old todos come in three groups; hard problems, already
solved, and easy changes that never got done. I left the first group alone,
closed many todos in the second group, and implemented a few easy changes.
Including `git annex sync -m` and adding some more info to `git annex info
remote`.
