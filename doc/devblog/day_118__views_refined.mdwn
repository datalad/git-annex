Still working on views. The most important addition today is that
`git annex precommit` notices when files have been moved/copied/deleted
in a view, and updates the metadata to reflect the changes.

Also wrote some walkthrough documentation: [[tips/metadata_driven_views]].  
And, recorded a screencast demoing views, which I will upload next time
I have bandwidth.
