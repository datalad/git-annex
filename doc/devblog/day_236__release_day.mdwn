Today's release has a month's accumulated changes, including several nice
new features: `git annex undo`, `git annex proxy`, `git annex diffdriver`,
and I was able to land the s3-aws branch in this release too, so lots of
improvements to the S3 support.

Spent several hours getting the autobuilders updated, with the haskell
`aws` library installed. Android and armel builds are still out of date.

Also fixed two Windows bugs related to the location of the bundled ssh
program.
