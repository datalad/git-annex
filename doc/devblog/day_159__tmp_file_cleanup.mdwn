Today was mostly spent driving across Brazil, but I had energy this evening
for a little work on git-annex.

Made the assistant delete old temporary files on startup. I've had
scattered reports of a few users whose `.git/annex/tmp` contained many
files, apparently put there by the assistant when it locks down a file
prior to annexing it. That seems it could possibly be a bug -- or it could
just be unclean shutdowns interrupting the assistant. Anyway, this will
deal with any source of tmp cruft, and I made sure to preserve
tmp files for partially downloaded content.
