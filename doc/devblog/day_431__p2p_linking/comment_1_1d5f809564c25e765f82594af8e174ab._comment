I already mentionned the project in [[design/assistant/telehash/]],
but [magic-wormhole](https://github.com/warner/magic-wormhole) does
exactly that:

    % wormhole send README.md
    Sending 7924 byte file named 'README.md'
    On the other computer, please run: wormhole receive
    Wormhole code is: 7-crossover-clockwork
    
    Sending (<-10.0.1.43:58988)..
    100%|=========================| 7.92K/7.92K [00:00<00:00, 6.02MB/s]
    File sent.. waiting for confirmation
    Confirmation received. Transfer complete.

Receiver:

    % wormhole receive
    Enter receive wormhole code: 7-crossover-clockwork
    Receiving file (7924 bytes) into: README.md
    ok? (y/n): y
    Receiving (->tcp:10.0.1.43:58986)..
    100%|===========================| 7.92K/7.92K [00:00<00:00, 120KB/s]
    Received file written to README.md

While that example shows a file transfer, arbitrary data can be
transfered this way. There's a documented protocol, and it's not
completely peer-to-peer: there are relay servers to deal with NAT'd
machines. But the [PAKE
protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Password-authenticated_key_agreement)
(basically SPAKE2) could be a good inspiration here.

Otherwise, I must say that, as a user, I don't mind copy-pasting a
hidden service string (if that's what it's about): i can do that over
a secure medium (email + OpenPGP or IM + OTR) easily... But I
understand it can be difficult to do for new users.
