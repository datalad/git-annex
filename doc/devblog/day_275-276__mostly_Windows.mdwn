Mostly working on Windows recently. Fixed handling of git
repos on different drive letters. Fixed crazy start menu loop. Worked around
stange msysgit version problem.

Also some more work on the `concurrentprogress` branch, making the progress
display prettier.

Added one nice new feature yesterday: `git annex info $dir` now includes a
table of repositories that are storing files in the directory, with their
sizes.

	repositories containing these files: 
		288.98 MB: ca9c5d52-f03a-11df-ac14-6b772ffe59f9 -- archive-5
		288.98 MB: f1c0ce8d-d848-4d21-988c-dd78eed172e8 -- archive-8
		 10.48 MB: 587b9ccf-4548-4d6f-9765-27faecc4105f -- darkstar

Nice thing about this feature is it's done for free, with no extra work other
than a little bit of addition. All the heavy location lookup work was already
being done to get the numcopies stats.
