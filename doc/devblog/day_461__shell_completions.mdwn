A new version of optparse-applicative supports zsh and fish shell
completions. Got that integrated into git-annex, although it will be a
while until most builds are updated to that version of the library.
Also, re-submitted my old patch from 2015 to make "git annex<tab>"
always tab complete in bash.

Enough other small fixes and improvements have accumulated that a release
is due soon..
