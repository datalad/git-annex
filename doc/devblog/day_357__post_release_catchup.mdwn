After finally releasing git-annex 6 yesterday, I did some catching up
today, and got the message backlog back down from 120 to 100.

By the way, the first OSX release of git-annex 6 was broken; I had to fix
an issue on the builder and update the build. If you upgraded at the wrong
time, you might find that git-annex doesn't run; if so reinstall it.
I now have an account on a separate OSX machine from the build machine,
that automatically tests the daily build, to detect such problems.
