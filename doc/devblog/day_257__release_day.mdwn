Today's release doesn't have the database branch merged of course, but it
still has a significant amount of changes.

Developed a test case for the sqlite problem, that
reliably reproduces it, and sent it to the sqlite mailing list. It seems
that under heavy write load, when a new connection is made to the database,
SELECT can fail for a little while. Once one SELECT succeeds, that database
connection becomes solid, and won't fail any more (apparently). This makes
me think there might be some connection initialization steps that don't end
up finishing before the SELECT goes through in this situation. I should be
able to work around this problem by probing new connections for stability,
and probably will have to, since it'll be years before any bug fixed sqlite
is available everywhere.

I also noticed that current git-annex incremental parallel fsck doesn't
really parallelize well; eg the processes do duplicate work. So, the
database branch is not really a regression in this area.
