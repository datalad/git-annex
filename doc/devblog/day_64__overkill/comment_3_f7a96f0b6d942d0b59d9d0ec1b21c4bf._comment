I don't think you should bother trying to support upgrades when people are running from a dmg. A DMG is just a disk image, and a format commonly used to distribute software. Running software from a DMG is not something anyone does beyond a quick first test of an application. A more reasonable thing to do, which many applications do now, is to offer to move the application from the DMG to /Applications if you detect someone is running it from a DMG.
