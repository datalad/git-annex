Release today, right on bi-weekly schedule. Rather startled
at the size of the changelog for this one; along with the direct mode
guard, it adds support for OS X Mavericks, Android 4.3/4.4, and fixes
numerous bugs.

Posted another question in the survey,
<http://git-annex-survey.branchable.com/polls/2013/roadmap/>.

Spun off git-repair as an independant package from git-annex. Of course,
most of the source code is shared with git-annex. I need to do something
with libraries eventually..
