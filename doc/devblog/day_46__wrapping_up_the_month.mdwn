Spent today reviewing my [[plans_for_the_month|assistant/disaster_recovery]]
and filling in a couple of missing peices.

Noticed that I had forgotten to make repository repair clean up any stale
git locks, despite writing that code at the beginning of the month, and
added that in.

Made the webapp notice when a repository that is being used does not have
any consistency checks configured, and encourage the user to set up checks.
This happens when the assistant is started (for the local repository),
and when removable drives containing repositories are plugged in. If the
reminders are annoying, they can be disabled with a couple clicks.

And I think that just about wraps up the month. (If I get a chance, I would
still like to add recovery of git-remote-gcrypt encrypted git repositories.)

My [[design/roadmap]] has next month dedicated to user-driven features
and polishing and bugfixing.
