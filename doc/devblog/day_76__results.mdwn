Fixed up a few problems with the Windows webapp, and it's now completely
usable, using any browser other than MSIE. While there are missing
features in the windows port, all the UI for the features it does have
seems to just work in the webapp.

Fixed a ugly problem with Firefox, which turned out to have been introduced
a while ago by a workaround for an ugly problem in Chrome. Web browsers are
so wonderful, until they're crap.

Think I've fixed the bug in the EvilLinker that was causing it to hang on
the autobuilder, but still don't have a Windows autobuild with the webapp
just yet.

Also improved `git annex import` some more, and worked on a bug in git
repository repair, which I will need to spend some more time on tomorrow.
