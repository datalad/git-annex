Got the release out after more struggling with ssh on windows and a last
minute fix to the quvi support.

The downloads.kitenet.net git annex repository had accumulated 6 gb of past
builds that were not publically available. I am publishing those 
[on the Internet Archive now](https://archive.org/details/git-annex-builds),
so past builds can be downloaded using git-annex in that repository in the
usual way. This worked great! :)

I have ordered a CubieTruck with 2 gb of ram to use for the new Arm builder.
Hosting still TBD.

Looks like git-annex is almost ready to
[be included in stackage](https://github.com/fpco/stackage/pull/519#issuecomment-98590181),
which will make building it from source much less likely to fail due to
broken libraries etc.
