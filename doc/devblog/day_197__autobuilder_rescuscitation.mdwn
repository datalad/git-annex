Yay, the Linux autobuilder is back! Also fixed the Windows build.

Fixed a reversion that prevented the webapp from starting
properly on Windows, which was introduced by some bad locking when I put in
the hack that makes it log to the log file on that platform.

Various other minor fixes here and there. There are almost enough
to do a release again soon.

I've also been trying to bootstrap ghc 7.8 on arm, for Debian. There's a script
that's supposed to allow building 7.8 using 7.6.3, dealing with a linker
problem by using the gold linker. Hopefully that will work since otherwise
Debian could remain stuck with an old ghc or worse lose the arm ports.
Neither would be great for git-annex..
