git-annex 6.20160419 has a rare security fix.
A [bug](http://git-annex.branchable.com/bugs/External_special_remote_broken__63__/) made encrypted special
remotes that are configured to use chunks accidentally expose the checksums
of content that is uploaded to the remote. Such information is supposed to
be hidden from the remote's view by the encryption. The same bug also made
resuming interrupted uploads to such remotes start over from the beginning.

After releasing that, I've been occupied today with fixing the Android
autobuilder, which somehow got its build environment broken (unsure how),
and fixing some other dependency issues.
