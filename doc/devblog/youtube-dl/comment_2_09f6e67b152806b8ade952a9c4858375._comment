Here's the translation:

I've encountered an issue. I am using yt-dlp with the following settings:
annex.youtube-dl-options \"--proxy socks5://127.0.0.1:1080 --config-locations ~/.config/yt-dlp/config\"

But when I try to download a video playlist using git-annex addurl, I always get the following error:
yt-dlp did not put any media in its work directory, perhaps it's been configured to store files somewhere else?

What could be the problem?

Thanks in advance.
