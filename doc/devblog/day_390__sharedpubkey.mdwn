It's not every day I add a new special remote encryption mode to
git-annex! The new encryption=sharedpubkey mode
lets anyone with a clone of the git repository (and access to the remote)
store files in the remote, but then only the private key owner can access
those files. Which opens up some interesting new use cases...
