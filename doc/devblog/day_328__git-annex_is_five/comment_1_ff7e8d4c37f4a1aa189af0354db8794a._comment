wow, this is great news! :) happy birthday to git-annex, and congratulations on the parents - which is mostly Joey, i guess, but also all those kickstarter contributors, docs writers, bug reporters and patch senders!

long (hopefully *eternal*) life to git-annex and the data it protects! :)

and thanks again, and again joeyh!
