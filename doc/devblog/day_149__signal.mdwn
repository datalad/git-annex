[[!meta title="day 150 signal"]]

The git-remote-daemon now robustly handles loss of signal, with
reconnection backoffs. And it detects if the remote ssh server has too
old a version of git-annex-shell and the webapp will display a warning
message.

Also, made the webapp show a network signal bars icon next to both
ssh and xmpp remotes that it's currently connected with. And, updated the
webapp's nudging to set up XMPP to now suggest either an XMPP or a ssh remote.

I think that the `remotecontrol` branch is nearly ready for merging!
