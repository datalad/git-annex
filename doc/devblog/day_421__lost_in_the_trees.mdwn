Finished up where I left off yesterday, writing test cases and fixing
bugs with syncing in adjusted branches. While adjusted branches need v6
mode, and v6 mode is still considered experimental, this is still a rather
nasty bug, since it can make files go missing (though still available
in git history of course). So, planning to release a new version with these
fixes as soon as the autobuilders build it.
