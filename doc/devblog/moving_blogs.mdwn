I've started a new page for my devblog, since I'm not focusing extensively
on the assistant and so keeping the blog [[here|design/assistant/blog]]
increasingly felt wrong. Also, my new year of
[crowdfunded development](https://campaign.joeyh.name)
formally starts in September, so a new blog seemed good.
