Hi Joey,

Does this mean that, for example, when uploading many small files to a special remote, that git-annex could upload more than one at a time?  Sometimes it seems like the time spent waiting for a small file to upload is mostly spent waiting for the server to begin accepting the file.   With lots of small files, this adds up (similar to how round-trip time slows down Obnam significantly when using a network repo).

Thanks.
