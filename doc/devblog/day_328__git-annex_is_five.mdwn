The first release of git-annex was 5 years ago.

There have been a total of 187 releases, growing to 50k lines of haskell
code developed by 28 contributors (and another 10 or so external special
remote contributors). Approximately 2000 people have posted questions,
answers, bugs, todos, etc to this website, with 18900 posts in total.

I've been funded for 3 of the 5 years to work on git-annex, with support
from [[1451 individuals and 6 organizations|thanks]].

Released a new version today with rather more significant changes than usual
(see recent devblog entries).

The [2015 git-annex user survey](http://git-annex-survey.branchable.com/polls/2015/)
is now live.
