The SHA-3 specification was released yesterday; git-annex got support for
using SHA-3 hashes today. I had to add support for building with the new
cryptonite library, as cryptohash doesn't (correctly) implement SHA-3 yet.
Of course, nobody is likely to find a use for this for years, since SHA-2
is still prefectly fine, but it's nice to get support for new hashes
in early. :)
