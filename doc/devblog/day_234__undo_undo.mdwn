Built the `git annex undo` command. This is intended to be a simple
interface for users who have changed one file, and want to undo the change
without the complexities of `git revert` or `git annex proxy`. It's simple
enough that I added undo as an action in the file manager integration.

And yes, you can undo an undo. :)
