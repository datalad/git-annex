Today I added a feature to `git annex unused` that lets the user tune which
refs they are interested in using. Annexed objects that are used by other
refs then are considered unused.

Did a fairly complicated refspec format for this, with globs and
include/exclude of refs. Example:

	+refs/heads/*:+HEAD^:+refs/tags/*:-refs/tags/old-tag

I think that, since Google dropped openid support, there seems to have been
less activity on this website. Although possibly also a higher signal to
noise ratio. :) I have been working on some ikiwiki changes to make it
easier for users who don't have an openid to contiribute. So git-annex's
website should soon let you log in and make posts with just an email address.

People sometimes ask for a git-annex mailing list. I wouldn't mind having
one, and would certianly subscribe, but don't see any reason that I should
be involved in running it.
