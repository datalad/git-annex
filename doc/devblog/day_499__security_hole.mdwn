I'm writing this on a private branch, it won't be posted until a week from
now when the security hole is disclosed.

Security is not compositional. You can have one good feature, and add
another good feature, and the result is not two good features, but a new
security hole. In this case
[[security/CVE-2018-10857_and_CVE-2018-10859|CVE-2018-10857]]. 
And it can be hard to spot this kind of security hole, but then once it's
known it seems blindly obvious.

It came to me last night and by this morning I had decided the potential
impact was large enough to do a coordinated disclosure. Spent the first
half of the day thinking through ways to fix it that don't involve writing
my own http library. Then started getting in touch with all the
distributions' security teams. And then coded up a fairly complete fix for
the worst part of the security hole, although a secondary part is going to
need considerably more work.

It looks like the external special remotes are going to need at least some
security review too, and I'm still thinking that part of the problem over.

Exhausted.
