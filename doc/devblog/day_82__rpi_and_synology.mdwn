Fixed a few problems in the [[armel build|install/Linux_standalone]], and
it's been confirmed to work on Raspberry Pi and Synology NAS. Since none of
the fixes were specific to those platforms, it will probably work anywhere
the kernel is new enough. That covers 9+% of the 
[missing ports in the user survey](http://git-annex-survey.branchable.com/polls/2013/missing_ports/)!

Thought through the possible issues with the assistant on Windows not being
able to use lsof. I've convinced myself it's probably safe. (In fact, it
might be safe to stop checking with lsof when using the assistant in direct
mode entirely.) Also did some testing of some specific interesting
circumstances (including 2 concurrent writers to a single file).

I've been working on adding the webapp to the armel build. This can mostly
reuse the patches and EvilSplicer developed for Android, but it's taking
some babysitting of the build to get yesod etc installer for various reasons.
Will be surprised if I don't get there tomorrow.

One other thing.. I notice that <http://git-annex.org/> is up and running.
This was set up by Subito, who offered me the domain, but I suggested he
keep it and set up a pretty start page that points new users at the
relevant parts of the wiki. I think he's done a good job with that!
