Multicast is only being used to send git-annex objects around, not git
objects. There's assumed to be some way to sync git repositories, which is
how the encryption keys for uftp are distributed.

`git annex multicast --send` operates on files in the working tree.
It would be possible to make it support `--all`.

I'm not sure if uftp can send outside the local LAN.

It would certianly be possible to have a special remote backed by uftp
that thus only sends to a single host. Since multicast does not send
to any particular remote, it did not make sense to implement it
as a special remote.
