I try hard to keep this devblog about git-annex development and not me.
However, it is a shame that what I wanted to be the beginning of my first
real month of work funded by the new campaign has been marred by my home's
internet connection being taken out by a lightning strike, and by illness.
Nearly back on my feet after that, and waiting for my new laptop to
finally get here.

Today's work: Finished up the `git annex forget` feature and merged it in.
Fixed the bug that was causing the commit race detection code to
incorrectly fire on the commit made by the transition code. Few other bits
and pieces.
