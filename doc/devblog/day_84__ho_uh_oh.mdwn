Resurfaced today to fix some problems with the Linux standalone builds
in the Solstice release. The worst of these prevented the amd64 build from
running on some systems, and that build has been updated. The other
problems all involved the binary shimming, and were less serious.

As part of that work, replaced the hacky shell script that handled the
linux library copying and binary shimming with a haskell program.

Also worked on some Windows bugs, and fixed a typo in the test suite.
Got my own little present: haskell-tasty finally got out of Incoming, so
the next Debian package build will once again include the test suite.
