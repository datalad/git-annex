Updated the Debian stable backport to the last release. Also it seems that
the last release unexpectedly fixed XMPP SIGILL on some OSX machines.
Apparently when I rebuilt all the libraries recently, it somehow fixed that
[[old_unsolved_bug|bugs/Share_with_friends_crash_in_osx]].

[RichiH](http://richardhartmann.de/) suggested "wrt ballooning memory on
repair: can you read in broken
stuff and simply stop reading once you reach a certain threshold, then
start repairing, re-run fsck, etc?" .. I had considered that but was
not sure it would work. I think I've gotten it to work.

Now working on a design for using a [[design/caching_database]]
for some parts of git-annex. My initial benchmarks using SQLite
indicate it would slow down associated file lookups by nearly an order of
magnitude compared with the current ".map files" implementation.
(But would scale better in edge cases). OTOH, using a SQLite
database to index metadata for use in views looks very promising.
