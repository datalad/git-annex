Built everything needed to run a fsck when a remote gets connected. Have
not tested it; only testing is blocking merging the incrementalfsck branch
now.

Also updated the OSX and Android builds to use a new gpg release (denial of
service security fix), and updated the Debian backport, and did a small
amount of bug fixing. I need to do several more days of bug fixing once 
I get this incremental fsck feature wrapped up before moving on to recovery
of corrupt git repositories.
