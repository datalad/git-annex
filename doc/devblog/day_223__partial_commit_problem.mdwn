`git commit $some_unlocked_file` seems like a reasonably common thing for
someone to do, so it's surprising to find that it's a [[little bit broken|/bugs/modified_permissions_persist_after_unlock__44___commit]],
leaving the file staged in the index after (correctly) committing the
annexed symlink.

This is caused by either a bug in git and/or by git-annex abusing the
git post-commit hook to do something it shouldn't do, although it's not
unique in using the post-commit hook this way. I'm talking this over with
Junio, and the fix will depend on the result of that conversation. It might
involve git-annex detecting this case and canceling the commit, asking the
user to `git annex add` the file first. Or it might involve a new git hook,
although I have not had good luck getting hooks added to git before.

Meanwhile, today I did some other bug fixing. Fixed the Internet Archive
support for embedcreds=yes. Made `git annex map` work for remote repos
in a directory with an implicit ".git" prefix. And fixed a
strange problem where the repository repair code caused a `git gc` to run
and then tripped over its pid file.

I seem to have enough fixes to make another release pretty soon.
Especially since the current release of git-annex doesn't build with yesod
1.4.
