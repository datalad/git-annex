Have been working on some improvements to `git annex enable-tor`. Made it
su to root, using any su-like program that's available. And made it test
the hidden service it sets up, and wait until it's propigated the the Tor
directory authorities. The webapp will need these features, so I thought I
might as well add them at the command-line level.

Also some messing about with locale and encoding issues. About most of
which the less said the better. One significant thing is that I've made the
filesystem encoding be used for all IO by git-annex, rather than needing to
explicitly enable it for each file and process. So, there should be much
less bother with encoding problems going forward.
