Last night, got logging to daemon.log working on Windows. Aside from XMPP
not working (but it's near to being deprecated anyway), and some possible
issues with unicode characters in filenames, the Windows port now seems in
pretty good shape for a beta release.

Today, mostly worked on fixing the release process so the metadata
accurarely reflects the version from the autobuilder that is included in
the release. Turns out there was version skew in the last release (now
manually corrected). This should avoid that happening again, and also
automates more of my release process.
