Well, not the literal last `push`, but I've caught up on as much backlog as
I can (142 messages remain) and spent today developing a few final features
before tomorrow's release.

Some of the newer things displayed by `git annex info` were not included in
the --json mode output. The json includes everything now.

`git annex sync --all --content` will make it consider all known annexed
objects, not only those in the current work tree. By default that syncs all
versions of all files, but of course preferred content can tune what
repositories want.

To make that work well with preferred content settings like
"include=*.mp3", it makes two passes. The first pass is over the work tree,
so preferred content expressions that match files by name will work. The
second pass is over all known keys, and preferred content expressions
that don't care about the filename can match those keys. 

Two passes feels a bit like a hack, but it's a lot better than `--all`
making nothing be synced when the a preferred content expression matches
against filenames... I actually had to resort to bloom filters to make the
two passes work.

This new feature led to some
[slightly tricky follow-on changes](http://source.git-annex.branchable.com/?p=source.git;a=commit;h=8268f7951e9c70760379bd084425b48df99250d6)
to the [[preferred_content/standard_groups]] preferred content expressions.
