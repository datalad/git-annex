Only did a few hours today, getting started on implementing the
[[design/external_special_remote_protocol]].

Mostly this involved writing down types for the various messages,
and code to parse them. I'm very happy with how the parsing turned out;
nearly all the work is handled by the data types and type classes,
and so only one line of very simple code is needed to parse each message:

[[!format haskell """
instance Receivable Response where
       parseCommand "PREPARE-SUCCESS" = parse0 PREPARE_SUCCESS
       parseCommand "TRANSFER-SUCCESS" = parse2 TRANSFER_SUCCESS
       parseCommand "TRANSFER-FAILURE" = parse3 TRANSFER_FAILURE
"""]]]

An especially nice part of this implementation is that it knows exactly how
many parameters each message should have (and their types of course), and so
can both reject invalid messages, and avoid ambiguity in tokenizing the
parameters. For example, the 3rd parameter of TRANSFER-FAILURE is an error
message, and as it's the last parameter, it can contain multiple words.

	*Remote.External> parseMessage "TRANSFER-FAILURE STORE SHA1--foo doesn't work on Christmas" :: Maybe Response
	Just (TRANSFER_FAILURE Upload (Key {keyName = "foo", keyBackendName = "SHA1", keySize = Nothing, keyMtime = Nothing}) "doesn't work on Christmas")

That's the easy groundwork for external special remotes, done.
