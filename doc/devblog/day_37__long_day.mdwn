A long day of bugfixing. Split into two major parts. First I got back to a
bug I filed in August to do with the assistant misbehaving when run in a
subdirectory of a git repository, and did a nice type-driven fix of the
underlying problem (that also found and fixed some other related bugs that
would not normally occur). Then, spent 4 hours in Windows purgatory working
around crazy path separator issues.
