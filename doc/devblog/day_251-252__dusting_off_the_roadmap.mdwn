Many more little improvements made yesterday and part of today. While
it's only been a week since the last release, it feels almost time
to make another one, after so many recent bug fixes and small improvements.

I've updated the [[design/roadmap]]. I have been operating without a
roadmap for half a year, and it would be nice to have some plans.
Keeping up with bug reports and requests as they come in is a fine mode
of work, but it can feel a little aimless. It's good to have a planned out
course, or at least some longer term goals.

After the next release, I've penciled in the second half of this month to
work on the [[design/caching_database]].
