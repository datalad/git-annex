Feeling kind of ready to cut the next release of git-annex, but am giving
the recent large changes just a little time to soak in and make sure
they're ok.

Yesterday, changed the order that `git annex sync --content` and the
assistant do drops. When dropping from the local repo and also some
remotes, it now makes more sense to drop from the remotes first, and only
then the local repo. There are scenaries where that order lets content be
dropped from all the places that it should be, while the reverse order
doesn't.

Today, caught up on recent bug reports, including fixing a bad merge
commit that was made when git merge failed due to filenames not supported by
a crippled filesystem, and cleaning up a network transport warning that was
displayed incorrectly. Also developed a patch to the `aws` library to
support google nearline when creating buckets.
