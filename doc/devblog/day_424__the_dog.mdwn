[[!meta title="the dog that didn't bark"]]

Worked on several bug reports today, fixing some easy ones, and following
up on others. And then there are the hard bugs.. Very pleased that I was
able to eventually reproduce a bug based entirely on the information
that git-annex's output did not include a filename. Didn't quite get that
bug fixed though.

At the end of the day, got a bug report that `git annex add` of filenames
containing spaces has broken. This is a recent reversion and I'm pushing
out a release with a fix ASAP.
