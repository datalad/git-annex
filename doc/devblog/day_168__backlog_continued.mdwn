Worked on triaging several bugs. Fixed an easy one, which involved the
assistant choosing the wrong path to a repository that has multiple
remotes. After today, backlog is down to 43, nearly pre-Brazil levels.

It seems that git-remote-gcrypt [[never quite worked on OSX|bugs/remote_gcrypt_based_repos_and_conflicting_uuids]].
It looked like it did, but a bug prevented anything being pushed to the remote.
Tracked down and fixed that bug.

This evening, getting back to working on the armel autobuilder setup
using propellor. The autobuilder will use a pair of docker containers, one
armel and a companion amd64, and their quite complex setup will be *almost*
fully automated (except for the haskell library patching part).
