The `tor` branch is coming along nicely.

This weekend, I continued working on the P2P protocol, implementing
it for network sockets, and extending it to support connecting up
git-send-pack/git-receive-pack. 

There was a bit of a detour when I split the Free monad into two separate
ones, one for Net operations and the other for Local filesystem operations.

Today, implemented a `git-remote-tor-annex` command that git will
use for tor-annex:: urls,  and made `git annex remotedaemon`
serve the tor hidden service.

Now I have git push/pull working to the hidden service, for example:

	git pull tor-annex::eeaytkuhaupbarfi.onion:47651

That works very well, but does not yet check that the user is authorized
to use the repo, beyond knowing the onion address. And currently
it only works in git-annex repos; with some tweaks it should
also work in plain git repos.

Next, I need to teach git-annex how to access tor-annex remotes.
And after that, an interface in the webapp for setting them up and
connecting them together.
