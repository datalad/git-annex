While I plowed through a lot of backlog the past several days,
I still have some 120 messages piled deep.

That work did result in a number of improvements, culminating in a rather
rushed release of version 5.20150327 today, to fix a regression affecting
`git annex sync` when using the standalone linux tarballs. Unfortunately, I
then had to update those tarballs a second time after the release
as the first fix was incomplete.

And, I'm feeling super stressed out. At this point, I think I should step
away until the end of the month. Unfortunately, this will mean more backlog
later. Including lots of noise and hand-holding that I just don't seem to
have time for if I want to continue making forward progress.

Maybe I'll think of a way to deal with it while I'm away. Currently, all I
have is that I may have to start ignoring irc and the forum, and
de-prioritizing bug reports that don't have either a working reproduction
recipe or multiple independent confirmations that it's a real bug.
