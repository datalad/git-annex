There was one more test suite failure when run on FAT, which I've
investigated today. It turns out that
[a bug report](https://git-annex.branchable.com/bugs/Assistant_keeps_deleting_all_the_files_in_my_repo/)
was filed about the same problem, and at root
it seems to be a [bug in git merge](http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.version-control.git/297237).
Luckily, it was not hard to work around the strange merge behavior.

It's been very worthwhile running the test suite on FAT; it's pointed me at
several problems with adjusted branches over the past weeks. It would be
good to add another test suite pass to test adjusted branches explicitly,
but when I tried adding that, there were a lot of failures where the test
suite is confused by adjusted branch behavior and would need to be taught
about it.

I've released git-annex 6.20160613. If you're using v6 repositories and
especially adjusted branches, you should upgrade since it has many fixes.
