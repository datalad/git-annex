The OSX autobuilder has been updated to OSX 10.10 Yosemite. The 
[resulting build](https://downloads.kitenet.net/git-annex/OSX/current/10.10_Yosemite/git-annex.dmg)
might also work on 10.9 Mavericks too, and I'd appreciate help testing that.

Went ahead and fixed the [[partial commit problem|bugs/modified_permissions_persist_after_unlock__44___commit]]
by making the pre-commit hook detect and block problematic partial commits.
