Last week I only had energy to work most of each day on git-annex,
or to blog about it. I chose quiet work. The changelog did grow
a good amount.

Today, fixed some autobuilder problems, and I am gearing up to add another
autobuild, targeting arm boxes with older linux kernels, since I got a
chance to upgrade the arm autobuilder's disk this weekend.

Also, some work on the S3 special remote, and worked around a bug in
sqlite's handling of umask.

Backlog is down to 243 messages.

Today's work was sponsored by Trenton Cronholm on Patreon.
