Hi Joey,

git annex has become great.  In the past I spent a lot of time fiddeling with it and even lost files.  Now, it all runs in the background flawlessly.
Even the \"spin up\" of the disk is

In any case, I would be very happy to help fund the development in what way I can.
However, it would be great if you could point out a way to do single transfers to you, either by credit card or paypal (or a European bank transfer, which I guess is less interesting).
I'm also happy to support a rebooted campaign.joeyh.name.

Thanks,
Rasmus
