Reviewed Sören's updated bootstrap3 patch, which appeared while I was
[traveling](http://joeyh.name/blog/entry/the_real_Brazil/). Sören
kindly fixed it to work with Debian stable's old version of Yesod,
which was quite a lot of work. The new new bootstrap3 UI looks nice,
found a few minor issues, but expect to be able to merge it soon.

Started on [[design/assistant/sshpassword]] groundwork. Added a simple
password cache to the assistant, with automatic expiration, and made
git-annex be able to be run by ssh as the `SSH_ASKPASS` program.

The main difficulty will be changing the webapp's UI to prompt for the ssh
password when one is needed. There are several code paths in ssh remote
setup where a password might be needed. Since the cached password expires,
it may need to be prompted for at any of those points. Since a new page is
loading, it can't pop up a prompt on the current page; it needs to redirect
to a password prompt page and then redirect back to the action that needed
the password. ...At least, that's one way to do it.
I'm going to sleep on it and hope I dream up a better way.
