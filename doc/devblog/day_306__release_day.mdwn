Made a release today, with recent work, including the optparse-applicative
transition and initial gitlab.com support in the webapp.

I had time before the release to work out most of the wrinkles in the
gitlab.com support, but was not able to get gcrypt encrypted repos to work
with gitlab, for reasons that remain murky. Their git-annex-shell seems to
be misbehaving somehow. Will need to get some debugging assistance from the
gitlab.com developers to figure that out.
