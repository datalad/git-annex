Worked on metadata and views. Besides bugfixes, two features of note:

Made git-annex run a hook script, pre-commit-annex. And I wrote a
sample script that extracts metadata from lots of kinds of files,
including photos and sound files, using extract(1) to do the heavy lifting.
See [[tips/automatically_adding_metadata]].

Views can be filtered to not include a tag or a field.
For example, `git annex view tag=* !old year!=2013`
