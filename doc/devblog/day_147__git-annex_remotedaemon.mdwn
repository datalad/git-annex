Built `git-annex remotedaemon` command today. It's buggy, but it already
works! If you have a new enough git-annex-shell on a remote server, you can
run "git annex remotedaemon" in a git-annex repository, and it will notice
any pushes that get made to that remote from any other clone, and pull down
the changes.
