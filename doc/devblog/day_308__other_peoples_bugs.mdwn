Work today has started in the git-annex bug tracker, but the real bugs were
elsewhere. Got a patch into hinotify to fix its handling of filenames
received from inotify events when used in a non-unicode locale. Tracked
down why gitlab's git-annex-shell fails to initialize gcrypt repositories,
and filed a bug on gitlab-shell.

Yesterday, I got the Android autobuilder fixed. I had started upgrading it
to new versions of yesod etc, 2 months ago, and something in those new
versions led to character encoding problems that broke the template haskell
splicing. Had to throw away the work done for that upgrade, but at least
it's building again, at last.
