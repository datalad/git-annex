I'm on a long weekend. This did not prevent git-annex from getting an
impressive lot of features though, as Daniel Dent contributed
<https://github.com/DanielDent/git-annex-remote-rclone> which uses
[rclone](http://rclone.org/) to add support for a ton of additional cloud
storage things, including: 

Google Drive, Openstack Swift, Rackspace cloud files, Memset Memstore, Dropbox,
Google Cloud Storage, Amazon Cloud Drive, Microsoft One Drive, Hubic, Backblaze
B2, Yandex Disk

Wow! I hope that rclone will end up packaged in more distributions (eg Debian)
so this will be easier to set up.
