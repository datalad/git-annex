Pushed out the new release. This is the first one where I consider the
git-annex command line beta quality on Windows.

Did some testing of the webapp on Windows, trying out every part of the UI.
I now have eleven todo items involving the webapp listed in
[[todo/windows_support]]. Most of them don't look too bad to fix.
