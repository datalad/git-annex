Made a release yesterday, and caught up on most recent messages
earlier this week. Backlog stands at 128 messages.

Had to deal with an ugly problem with /usr/bin/glacier today. Seems that
there are multiple programs all using that name, some of them shipping in
some linux distributions, and the one from boto fails to fail when passed
parameters it doesn't understand. Yugh! I had to make git-annex probe to
make sure the right glacier program is installed.

I'm planning to deprecate the glacier special remote at some point.
Instead, I'd like to make the S3 special remote support the S3-glacier
lifecycle, so objects can be uploaded to S3, set to transition to
glacier, and then if necessary pulled back from glacier to S3. That should
be much simpler and less prone to break.

But not yet; [haskell-aws needs glacier support added](https://github.com/aristidb/aws/issues/81).
Or I could use the new amazonka library, but I'd rather stick with
haskell-aws.

Some other minor improvements today included adding `git annex
groupwanted`, which makes for easier examples than using vicfg, and
making `git annex import` support options like --include and --exclude.

Also I moved a many file matching options to only be accepted by
the commands that actually use them. Of the remaining common
options, most of them make sense for every command to accept (eg, --force
and --debug). It would make sense to move --backend, --notify-start/finish,
and perhaps --user-agent. Eventually.
