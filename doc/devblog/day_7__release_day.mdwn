Got git annex sync working with gcrypt. So went ahead and made a release
today. Lots of nice new features!

Unfortunately the linux 64 bit daily build is failing, because my build
host only has 2 gb of memory and it is no longer enough. I am looking for a
new build host, ideally one that doesn't cost me $40/month for 3 gb of ram
and 15 gb of disk. (Extra special ideally one that I can run multiple builds
per day on, rather than the current situation of only building overnight to
avoid loading the machine during the day.) Until this is sorted out, no
new 64 bit linux builds..
