Release made yesterday, but only finished up the armel build today. 
And it turns out the OSX build was missing the webapp, so it's also been
updated today.

Post release bug triage including:

Added a nice piece of UI to the webapp on user request: A "Sync now" menu
item in the repository for each repo. (The one for the current repo syncs with
all its remotes.)

Copying files to a git repository on the same computer turns out to have
had a resource leak issue, that caused 1 zombie process per file. With
some tricky monad state caching, fixed that, and also eliminated 8% of the work
done by git-annex in this case.

Fixed `git annex unused` in direct mode to not think that files that were
deleted out of the work tree by the user still existed and were unused.
