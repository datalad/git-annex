Next month the roadmap has me working on [[design/assistant/sshpassword]].
That will be a nice UI improvement and I'd be very surprised if it takes
more than a week, which is great.

Getting a jump on it today, investigating using `SSH_ASKPASS`. It seems this
will even work on Windows! Preliminary design in [[design/assistant/sshpassword]].

Time to get on a plane to a plane to a plane to Brasilia!
