Last night I tracked down and fixed a bug in the DAV library that has been
affecting WebDAV remotes. I've been deploying the fix for that today,
including to the android and arm autobuilders. While I finished a clean
reinstall of the android autobuilder, I ran into problems getting a clean
reinstall of the arm autobuilder (some type mismatch error building
yesod-core), so manually fixed its DAV for now.

The WebDAV fix and other recent fixes makes me want to make a release soon,
probably Monday.

ObWindows: Fixed git-annex to not crash when run on Windows
in a git repository that has a remote with a unix-style path 
like "/foo/bar". Seems that not everything aggrees on whether such a path
is absolute; even sometimes different parts of the same library disagree!

[[!format haskell """
import System.FilePath.Windows

prop_windows_is_sane :: Bool
prop_windows_is_sane = isAbsolute upath || ("C:\\STUFF" </> upath /= upath)
  where upath = "/foo/bar"
"""]]

Perhaps more interestingly, I've been helping dxtrish port git-annex to
OpenBSD and it seems most of the way there.
