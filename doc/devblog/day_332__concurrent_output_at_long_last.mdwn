Got git-annex using concurrent-output today. It works beautifully.
Since the library is new, git-annex has to be explicitly configured to use
it, so it'll be a while until this is available in regular builds.

There are no progress bars yet in concurrent output mode, but that will change
soon.. Probably tomorrow.
