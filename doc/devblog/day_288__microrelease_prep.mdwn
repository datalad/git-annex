After a less active than usual week (dentist), I made a release last Friday.
Unfortunately, it turns out that the Linux standalone 
builds in that release don't include the webapp. So, another release is
planned tomorrow.

Yesterday and part of today I dug into
the [[bugs/windows_ssh_webapp_password_entry_broken]]
reversion. Eventually cracked the problem; it seems that
different versions of ssh for Windows do different things in a `isatty`
check, and there's a flag that can be passed when starting ssh to make it
not see a controlling tty. However, this neeeds changes to the
`process` library, which db48x and I have now coded up. So a fix for this bug
is waiting on a new release of that library. Oh well.

Rest of today was catching up on recent traffic, and improving the behavior
of `git annex fsck` when there's a disk IO error while checksumming a file.
Now it'll detect a hardware fault exception, and take that to mean the file
is bad, and move it to the bad files directory, instead of just crashing.

I need better tooling to create disk IO errors on demand.
Yanking disks out works, but is a blunt instrument. Anyone know of
good tools for that?
