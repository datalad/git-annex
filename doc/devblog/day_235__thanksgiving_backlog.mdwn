Back from the holiday, catching up on traffic. Backlog stands at 113
messages.

Just before going on break, I added a new feature that I didn't mention
here. `git annex diffdriver` integrates git-annex with git's external diff
driver support. So if you have a smart diff program that can diff, say,
genome sequences, or cat videos, or something in some useful way, it
can be hooked up to `git diff` and will be able to see the content of
annexed files.

Also today, I spent a couple hours today updating the license file included
in the standalone git-annex builds to include the licenses of all the
haskell libraries git-annex depends on. Which I had for some reason not
thought to include before, despite them getting built into the git-annex
binary.
