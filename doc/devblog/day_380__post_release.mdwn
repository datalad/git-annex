Yesterday I released version 6.20160412, which is the first to support
adjusted branches.

Today, some planning for ways to better support `annex.thin`, but that
seems to be stuck on needing a way to update git's index file. Which is the
main thing needed to fix various problems with v6 unlocked files.

Dove back into the backlog, got it down to 144 messages. Several bug fixes.
