The difference picking the right type can make! Last night, I realized that
the where I had a `distributionSha256sum :: String`, I should instead use
`distributionKey :: Key`. This means that when git-annex is eventually
downloading an upgrade, it can treat it as just another Key being
downloaded from the web. So the webapp will show that transfer along with
all the rest, and I can leverage tons of code for a new purpose. For
example, it can simply fsck the key once it's downloaded to verify its
checksum.

Also, built a DistriutionUpdate program, which I'll run to generate the
info files for a new version. And since I keep git-annex releases in a
git-annex repo, this too leverages a lot of git-annex modules, and ended up
being just 60 easy lines of code. The upgrade notification code is tested
and working now.

And, I made the assistant detect when the git-annex program binary is
replaced or modified. Used my existing DirWatcher code for that. The plan
is to restart the assistant on upgrade, although I need to add some sanity
checks (eg, reuse the lsof code) first. And yes, this will work even for
`apt-get upgrade`!
