Today was a scramble to get caught up after weeks away. Got the message
backlog down from over 160 to 123. Fixed two reversions, worked around a
[strange bug](https://github.com/yesodweb/persistent/issues/474),
and implemented support for the `gpg.program` configuration, and made
several smaller improvements.
