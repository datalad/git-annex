After fixing a few bugs in the `remotecontrol` branch, It's landed in
`master`. Try a daily build today, and see if the assistant can keep in
sync using nothing more than a remote ssh repository!

So, now all the groundwork for telehash is laid too. I only need a
telehash library to start developing on top of. Development on telehash-c
is continuing, but I'm more excited that
[htelehash](https://github.com/alanz/htelehash/tree/v2) 
has been revived and is being updated to the v2 protocol, seemingly quite
quickly.
