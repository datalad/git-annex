Worked more on the `relativepaths` branch last night, and I am actually
fairly happy with it now, and plan to merge it after I've run it for a bit
longer myself.

It seems that I did manage to get a git-annex executable that is built PIE
so it will work on Android 5.0. But all the C programs like busybox
included in the Android app also have to be built that way. Arranging for
everything to get built twice and with the right options took up most of
today.
