that would be pretty awesome! thanks so much for looking into what others are doing: it takes great maturity and respect for others, something that is so often missing online...

i hope this can solve a bunch of WTF issues i've had with direct mode, which already improved by leaps and bounds, mind you. :)

speaking of which - would it make sense for git-annex to support lfs remotes out of the box? or is considered builtin to git (ie. if you install git-lfs, you can already have a hybrid lfs/annex repo?)
