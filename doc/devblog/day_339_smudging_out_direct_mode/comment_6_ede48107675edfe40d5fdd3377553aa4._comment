Thanks for the quick reply (and all your work on this!)

Interesting, that change to git does sound like it should be relatively small compared to the workarounds needed. But in any case, glad to hear you're thinking about the issue.

Also curious what your thoughts are on the performance issues you had identified previously with using smudge/clean on larger repos. Do the changes in git 2.5 address all your concerns? Or are there still some cases where this will potentially result in significant slow-down?
