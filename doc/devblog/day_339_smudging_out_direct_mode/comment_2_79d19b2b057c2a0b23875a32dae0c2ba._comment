Sure, it would be great to have a special remote supporting the git-lfs
storage backend. This would let git-annex repos be uploaded to github along
with the annexed files, which is a nice diversity to have in addition to
gitlab's support for git-annex.

The API is documented, so it's certianly doable, as an external special
remote even.
