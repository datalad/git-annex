I'm still not entirely happy with the smudge/clean interface's performance.
At least git doesn't fall over if the clean filter declines to read all the
content of the large file on stdin anymore, which was the main thing
preventing an optimised use of it. Still, git has to run the clean filter once
per file, which is suboptimal. And, the smudge filter can't modify the file in
the work tree, but instead has to pass the whole file content back to git
for writing, which is going to result in a lot of unnecessary context
switches and slowdown. Especially in git-annex's case, where all it really
needs to do is make a hard link to the content.
