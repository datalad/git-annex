Did I say it would be easy to make the webapp detect when a gcrypt repository 
already existed and enable it? Well, it wasn't exactly hard, but it took
over 300 lines of code and 3 hours..

So, gcrypt support is done for now. The glaring omission is gpg key
management for sharing gcrypt repositories between machines and/or people.
But despite that, I think it's solid, and easy to use, and covers some
great use cases.

Pushed out a release.

Now I really need to start thinking about
[[design/assistant/disaster_recovery]].
