Josh Tripplet has some haskell bindings for libgit2 somewhere.
My reasons for not using it so far include:

* ABI stability; at least it used to have none. soname is 21 already..
* Josh told me parts of it are much less optimised than git.
  (This was several years ago, but I still imagine the git code base
  has much more work on speed.)
* It's not even been in a stable release of Debian yet.
* Adding a C library dependency will make git-annex much harder for
  users to get started building.
* The couple of things that I could really use a git library for, like
  index file access and catting object contents, could be implemented
  just as well (and likely as fast) in pure haskell
  code, and would not be particularly hard to do either. There may even
  be suitable pure haskell libraries for them; haven't checked.
