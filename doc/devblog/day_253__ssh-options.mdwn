Spent a couple hours to make the ssh-options git config setting be used
in more places. Now it's used everywhere that git-annex supports ssh
caching, including the `git pull` and `git push` done by `sync` and by the
assistant. Also the `remotedaemon` and the gcrypt, rsync, and ddar
special remotes.
