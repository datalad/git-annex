Today, I've expanded `git annex info` to also be able to be used on annexed files
and on remotes. Looking at the info for an individual remote is quite
useful, especially for answering questions like: Does the remote have
embedded creds? Are they encrypted? Does it use chunking? Is that old style
chunking?

Should be quite useful info for debugging too..

Yesterday, I fixed a bug that prevented retrieving files from Glacier.
