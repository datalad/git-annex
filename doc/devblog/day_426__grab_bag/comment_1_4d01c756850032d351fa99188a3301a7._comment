git-annex already has a custom protocol detailed in [[design/external_special_remote_protocol]]. it could be quite useful to have that protocol extended to support direct object transfer instead of having to mess around with temporary files like may remotes do, for example...

maybe that makes no sense at all, i don't know. :) --[[anarcat]]
