Working on a design for [[design/adjusted_branches]]. I've been kicking
this idea around for a while to replace direct mode on crippled filesystems
with v6 unlocked files. And the same thing would allow for hiding not
present files. It's somewhat complicated, but the design I have seems like
it would work.
