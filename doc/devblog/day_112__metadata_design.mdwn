There's a new design document for letting git-annex store arbitrary
metadata. The really neat thing about this is the user can check out only
files matching the tags or values they care about, and get an automatically
structuted file tree layout that can be dynamically filtered. It's going to
be awesome! [[design/metadata]]

In the meantime, spent most of today working on Windows. Very good
progress, possibly motivated by wanting to get it over with so I can spend
some time this month on the above. ;)

* webapp can make box.com and S3 remotes. This just involved fixing a hack
  where the webapp set environment variables to communicate creds to
  initremote. Can't change environment on Windows (or I don't know how to).
* webapp can make repos on removable drives.
* `git annex assistant --stop` works, although this is not likely to really
  be useful
* The source tree now has 0 `func = error "Windows TODO"` type stubbed out
  functions to trip over.
