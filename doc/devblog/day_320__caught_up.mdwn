I've mostly been chewing through old and new bug reports and support
requests that past several days. The backlog is waaay low now -- only 82
messages! Just in time for me to go on another trip, to Louisville on
Thursday.

Amazon S3 added an "Infrequent Access" storage class last week, and I got a
patch into the haskell-aws library to support that, as well as partially
supporting Google Nearline. That patch was accepted today, and git-annex is
ready to use the new version of the library as soon as it's released.

At the end of today, I found myself rewriting `git annex status` to parse
and adjust the output of `git status --short`. This new method makes it
much more capable than before, including displaying Added files.
