I have seen the glory of the webapp running on Windows.

One of the warp developers pointed me in the right direction and I
developed a fix for the `recv` bug.

My Windows and MSIE are old and fall over on some of the
javascript, so it's not glorious enough for a screenshot. But large chunks
of it do seem to work.
