Now I can build git-annex twice as fast! And a typical incremental build is
down to 10 seconds, from 51 seconds.

Spent a productive evening working with Guilhem to get his encryption
patches reviewed and merged. Now there is a way to remove revoked gpg keys,
and there is a new encryption scheme available that uses public key
encryption by default rather than git-annex's usual approach. That's not
for everyone, but it is a good option to have available.
