Monday: Some finishing touches on the pid locking support, and released
5.20151116. After the release I noticed that concurrent downloads didn't
always include a progress meter, and made the necessary changes to fix
that.

Wednesday: This was a day of minor bug fixing and responding to questions
etc. Message backlog got down below 90, not bad.

Thursday: I've been distracted from coding today with an idea of making
some new stickers. Hexagonal this time, and even better, composable...
So they can show git-annex getting as big as you want. ;)

The design is done, see [[stickers]], and seems to work well, and even
better is easy to modify. May find time to get these printed at some point.
