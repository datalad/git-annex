Feels like I've been working on adjusted branches too long.

Did make some excellent progress today. Upgrading a direct mode repo to v6
will now enter an adjusted branch where all files are unlocked. Using an
adjusted branch like this avoids unlocking all files in the master branch
of the repo, which means that different clones of a repo can be
upgraded to v6 mode at different times. This should let me advance the
timetable for enabling v6 by default, and getting rid of direct mode.

Also, cloning a repository that has an adjusted branch checked out will
now work; the clone starts out in the same adjusted branch.

But, I realized today that the way merges from origin/master into
adjusted/master are done will often lead to merge conflicts. I have came up
with a better way to handle these merges that won't unncessarily conflict,
but didn't feel ready to implement that today.

Instead, I spent the latter half of the day getting caught up on some
of the backlog. Got it down from some 200 messages to 150.
