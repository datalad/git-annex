Is it realy a good idea to remove now the XMPP function ? While XMPP is a good tool to manage social relations and is getting improve ? [As you say it is an easy way to share with friends](http://joeyh.name/blog/entry/p2p_dreams/)

The lake of use of the XMPP function in Git-annex is may be due to the fact that Git-annex assistant and the XMPP feature are difficult to use on Windows - so 90% of social relations can't exist.

Can't you a least maintain the XMPP function ?
