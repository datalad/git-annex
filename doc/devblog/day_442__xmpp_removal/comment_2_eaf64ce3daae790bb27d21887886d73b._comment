One of your argument for removing XMPP is 

> _it was not entirely secure, since the XMPP server saw the contents of git pushes without encryption_

But since one years there is a new way to encrypt XMPP content end to end : [OMEMO Multi-End Message and Object Encryption](https://conversations.im/omemo/)

> _OMEMO is an XMPP Extension Protocol (XEP) for secure multi-client end-to-end encryption. It is an open standard based on a Double Ratchet and PEP which can be freely used and implemented by anyone. The protocol has been audited by a third party._

Here are other informations : [[https://gultsch.de/talks/omemo.html]]

You can see here the xmpp clients which are using it : [[https://omemo.top]]
