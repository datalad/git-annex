Catching up on some recent backlog after a trip and post-trip flu.

Anarcat wrote up an anlysis of [[tips/semi-synchronized_remotes]], and
based on that I implemented `remote.<name>.annex-push` and
`remote.<name>.annex-pull`

Also fixed the Windows build.

Today's work was sponsored by Thomas Hochstein on Patreon.
