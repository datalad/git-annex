Upgrades should be working on OSX Mavericks, Linux, and sort of on Android.
This needs more testing, so I have temporarily made the daily builds think
they are an older version than the last git-annex release. So when you
install a daily build, and start the webapp, it should try to upgrade
(really downgrade) to the last release. Tests appreciated.

Looking over the whole upgrade code base, it took 700 lines of code
to build the whole thing, of which 75 are platform specific (and mostly
come down to just 3 or 4 shell commands). Not bad..

Last night, added support for quvi 0.9, which has a completely changed
command line interface from the 0.4 version.

Plan to spend tomorrow catching up on bug reports etc and then low activity
for rest of the week.
