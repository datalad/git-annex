Spent hours today in a 10-minute build/test cycle, tracking down a bug that
caused the assistant to crash on Windows after exactly 10 minutes uptime.
Eventually found the cause; this is fallout from last month's work
that got it logging to the debug.log on Windows.

There was more, but that was the interesting one..
