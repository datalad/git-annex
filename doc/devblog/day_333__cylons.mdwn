Spent my time today porting concurrent-output to Windows, fixing a
tricky problem with error handling/thread joining with git-annex -J,
and improving the concurrent state handling to support the git command
queue. Got add/addurl working in concurrent mode.
No concurrent progress bars yet.. maybe tomorrow?
