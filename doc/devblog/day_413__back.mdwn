Back after taking most of August off and working on other projects.

Got the unanswered messages backlog down from 222 to 170. Still scary high.

Numerous little improvements today. Notable ones:

* Windows: Handle shebang in external special remote program. This is
  needed for [git-annex-remote-rclone to work on Windows](https://github.com/DanielDent/git-annex-remote-rclone/pull/10).
  Nice to see that external special remote is getting ported and
  apparently lots of use.
* Make --json and --quiet suppress automatic init messages, and any
  other messages that might be output before a command starts. This was a
  reversion introduced in the optparse-applicative changes over a year ago.

Also I'm developing a plan to improve parallel downloading when multiple
remotes have the same cost. See [[todo/get_round_robin]].
