Have waited too long for some next-generation encrypted P2P network, like
telehash to emerge. Time to stop waiting; tor hidden services are not as
cutting edge, but should work. Updated the [[design|design/assistant/telehash]]
and started implementation in the `tor` branch.

Unfortunately, Tor's default configuration does not enable the ControlPort.
And, changing that in the configuration could be problimatic. This
makes it harder than it ought to be to register a tor hidden service.
So, I implemented a `git annex enable-tor` command, which can be run as root
to set it up. The webapp will probably use `su-to-root` or `gksu` to run it. 
There's some Linux-specific parts in there, and it uses a socket for
communication between tor and the hidden service, which may cause problems
for Windows porting later.

Next step will be to get `git annex remotedaemon` to run as a tor hidden
service.

Also made a `no-xmpp` branch which removes xmpp support from the assistant.
That will remove 3000 lines of code when it's merged. Will probably wait
until after tor hidden services are working.
