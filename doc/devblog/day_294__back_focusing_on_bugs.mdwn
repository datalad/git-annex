Back, and have spent all day focusing on new bug reports. All told, I fixed
4 bugs, followed up on all other bugs reported while I was away, and fixed
the android autobuilder.

The message backlog started the day at 250 or something, and is down to 178
now. Looks like others have been following up to forum posts while I was
away (thanks!) so those should clear quickly.
