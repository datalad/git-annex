Reduced activity this week (didn't work on the assistant after all),
but several things got done:

Monday: Fixed `fsck --fast --from remote` to not fail when the remote
didn't support fast copy mode. And dealt with an incompatibility in S3 bucket
names; the old hS3 library supported upper-case bucket names but the new
one needs them all in lower case.

Wednesday: Caught up on most recent backlog, made some improvements
to error handling in `import`, and improved integration with KDE's file
manager to work with newer versions.

Today: Made `import --deduplicate/--clean-duplicates` actively 
verify that enough copies of a file exist before deleting it. And,
thinking about some options for batch mode access to git-annex plumbing,
to speed up things that use it a lot.
