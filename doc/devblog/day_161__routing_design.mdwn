I've moved out of implementation mode (unable to concentrate enough), and
into high-level design mode.

[[design/assistant/Syncing_efficiency]] has been an open TODO for years,
to find a way to avoid flood filling the network, and find more efficient
ways to ensure data only gets to the nodes that want it. Relatedly,
Android devices  often need a way to mark individual files they want to have.
Had a [very productive discussion with Vince and Fernao](http://joeyh.name/blog/entry/who_needs_whiteboards_when_you_have_strange_seed_pods_from_the_jungle/)
and I think we're heading toward a design that will address both these
needs, as well as some more Brazil-specific use cases, about which more
later.

Today's work was sponsored by Casa do Boneco.
