Been doing a little bit of optimisation work. Which meant, first improving
the --debug output to show fractions of a second, and show when commands
exit.

That let me measure what takes up time when downloading files from ssh remotes.
Found one place I could spawn a thread to run a cleanup action, and this simple
change reduced the non-data-transfer overhead to 1/6th of what it had been!
