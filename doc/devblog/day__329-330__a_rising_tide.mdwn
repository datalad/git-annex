Things have been relatively quiet on git-annex this week. I've been
distracted with other projects. But, a library that I developed for
[propellor](http://propellor.branchable.com/) to help with 
[concurrent console output](http://joeyh.name/blog/entry/concurrent_output_library/)
has been rapidly developing into a kind of
[tiling region manager for the console](http://joeyh.name/blog/entry/a_tiling_region_manager_for_the_console),
which may be just the thing git-annex needs on the concurrent
download progress display front.

After seeing it could go that way, and working on it around the clock to
add features git-annex will need, here's a teaser of its abilities.

Probably coming soonish to a `git-annex -J` near you!
