Got the Windows autobuilder building the webapp. Have not tried that build
yet myself, but I have high hopes it will work.

Made other Windows improvements, including making the installer
write a start menu entry file, and adding free disk space checking.

Spent rest of the day improving git repair code on a real-world corrupted
repository.
