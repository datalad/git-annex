Got the test suite passing 100%, but then added a pass that uses v6
unlocked files and 30-some more failures appeared. Fixed a couple of the
bugs today. After sprinting unexpectedly hard all December on v6, I need a
change of pace, so I started digging into the website message backlog
and fixed some bugs and posted some comments there.
