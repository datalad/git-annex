well, at least in the assistant there is no selection to add a webdav repository - only box.com, rsync.net, S3, remote ssh, and the archives on glazier or internet archive. It is the binary version from 16th this month. I thought it was still excluded due to the compiler crashes you wrote about, because it doesn't show up in the webapp as option. I was scratching my head anyway about that windows build, because there was nothing about setting up encryption in the configuration in the webapp.

Proxy support on Windows is kinda like proxy support on linux when you pull the proxy from gnome settings - just it is pulled from the registry. I don't know how Haskell HTTP client libraries handle it, only know it for Python - there the client libraries usually grab proxy settings automatically from the system configuration.

Another option which could work for me to get through our firewall at work would be ssh - I can use ssh with proxy commands to reach the outside, but didn't yet find the used ssh configs on the windows git-annex installation - it doesn't use the one in ~/.ssh, I added my proxy commands there, but that isn't used.
