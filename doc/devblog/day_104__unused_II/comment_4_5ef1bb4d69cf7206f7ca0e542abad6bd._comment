Oh, just noticed in the console window of the assistant:

ssh-keygen: /home/xgwsbae/.ssh/known_hosts: No such file or directory
ssh-keygen: /home/xgwsbae/.ssh/known_hosts: No such file or directory

Home directory is C:/Users/xgwsbae/ (git bash gives /c/Users/xgwsbae in $HOME) ... looks like something got confuzzled between Windows and Unix there.
