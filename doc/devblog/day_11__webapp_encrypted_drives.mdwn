Now the webapp can set up encrypted repositories on removable drives.

This UI needs some work, and the button to create a new key is not wired
up. Also if you have no gpg agent installed, there will be lots of password
prompts at the console.

Forked git-remote-gcrypt to fix a bug. Hopefully my patch will be merged;
for now I recommend installing my worked version.

Today's work was sponsored by Romain Lenglet.
