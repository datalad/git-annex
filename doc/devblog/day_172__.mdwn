Working on moving the android autobuilder to Docker & Propellor, which will
finish containerizing all the autobuilds that I run. Updated
ghc-android to use the released ghc 7.8.2, which will make it build more
reliably. 

Also did bug triage. Bugs are now divided into [[bugs/confirmed]]
and [[bugs/unconfirmed]] categories.
