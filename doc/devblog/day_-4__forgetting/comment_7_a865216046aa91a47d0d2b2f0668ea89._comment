Another thing I found, which was annoying is that I have objects in my annex not tracked anywhere it seems.
\"git annex fsck --all\" complains about not having access to the object. \"git log --stat -S '$key'\" doesn't have any record. \"git annex fsck\" has no issues and \"git annex unused\" comes up empty too.
I'm not sure where these objects still reside or why how to remove this annoying failure.

So not only should \"git annex forget $key\" remove references from within all branches, but should also clean up the aforementioned loose objects, which are neither unused, nor available, nor referenced.
