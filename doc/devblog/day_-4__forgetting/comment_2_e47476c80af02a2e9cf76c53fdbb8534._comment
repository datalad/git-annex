I have some repos where due to some hiccups file versions (not in the working tree anymore) were lost and now they come up again and again when fsck is running.
So I would be happy if I could make my repos forget these not available files via \"git annex forget $key\" and perhaps even have a better solution to show all objects with numcopies=0.
