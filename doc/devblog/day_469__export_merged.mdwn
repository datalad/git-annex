I've merged the `export` branch, after fixing most of the remaining known
warts, and testing clean-up from interrupted exports and export conflicts.

The main thing remaining to be done is adding the new commands to the
external special remote interface, and adding export support to S3, webdav,
and rsync special remotes.

Today's work was supported by the NSF-funded DataLad project.
