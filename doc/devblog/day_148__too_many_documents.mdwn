Various bug triage today. Was not good for much after shuffling paper for
the whole first part of the day, but did get a few little things done.

Re <http://heartbleed.com/>, git-annex does not use OpenSSL itself,
but when using XMPP, the remote server's key could have been intercepted
using this new technique. Also, the git-annex autobuilds and this website
are served over https -- working on generating new https certificates now.
Be safe out there..
