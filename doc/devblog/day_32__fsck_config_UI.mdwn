Last night, built this nice user interface for configuring periodic fscks:

[[!img assistant/fsckconfig.png]]

Rather happy that that whole UI needed only 140 lines of code to build.
Though rather more work behind it, as seen in this blog..

Today I added some support to git-annex for smart fscking of remotes.
So far only git repos on local drives, but this should get extended to
git-annex-shell for ssh remotes. The assistant can also run periodic fscks
of these.

Still need to test that, and find a way to make a removable drive's fsck
job run when the drive gets plugged in. That's where picking "any time"
will be useful; it'll let you configure fscking of removable drives when
they're available, as long as they have not been fscked too recently.
