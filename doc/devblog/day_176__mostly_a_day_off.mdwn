Got a handle on the Android webapp static file problems (no, they were not
really encoding problems!), and hopefully
that's all fixed now. Also, only 3 modules use Char8 now. And updated the
git-annex backport. That's all I did today.

Meanwhile, a complete [[tips/ZSH_completion]] has been contributed by
Schnouki. And, Ben Gamari sent in a patch moving from the deprecated 
MonadCatchIO-transformers library to the exceptions library.
