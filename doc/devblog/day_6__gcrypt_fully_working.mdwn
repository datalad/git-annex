gcrpyt is fully working now. *Most* of the examples in
[[tips/fully_encrypted_git_repositories_with_gcrypt]] should work.

A few known problems:

* `git annex sync` refuses to sync with gcrypt remotes. some url parsing issue.
* Swapping two drives with gcrypt repositories on the same mount point doesn't work yet.
* http urls are not supported
