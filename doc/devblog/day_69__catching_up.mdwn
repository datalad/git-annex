Still working through thanksgiving backlog. Around 55 messages to go.

Wrote hairy code to automatically fix up bad bare repositories created by
recent versions of git-annex. Managed to do it with only 1 stat call
overhead (per local repository). Will probably keep that code in git-annex
for a year or so, despite the bug only being present for a few weeks,
because the repositories that need to be fixed might be on removable drives
that are rarely used.

Various other small bug fixes, including dealing with box.com having
changed their WebDAV endpoint url.

Spent a while evaluating various key/value storage possibilities. 
[[bugs/incremental_fsck_should_not_use_sticky_bit]] has the details.
