Took a holiday week off from git-annex development, and started a new side
project building [shell-monad](http://joeyh.name/code/shell-monad/), which
might eventually be used in some parts of git-annex that generate shell
scripts.

Message backlog is 165 and I have not dove back into it, but I have started
spinning back up the development engines in preparation for new year
takeoff. 

Yesterday, added some minor new features -- `git annex sync` now
supports git remote groups, and I added a new plumbing command
`setpresentkey` for those times when you really need to mess with
git-annex's internal bookkeeping. Also cleaned up a lot of build warning
messages on OSX and Windows.

Today, first some improvements to make `addurl` more robust.
Then the rest of the day was spent on Windows. Fixed (again)
the Windows port's problem with rsync hating DOS style filenames. Got
the rsync special remote fully working on Windows for the first time.

Best of all, got the Windows autobuilder to run the test
suite successfully, and fixed a couple test suite failures on Windows.
