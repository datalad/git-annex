The exposed information is not stored in the remote. If it's stored
anywhere, it would be in a server log, which might log an attempt
to access an un-encrypted key filename (which typically includes the
checksum and maybe the file's extension).

So on the one hand, you don't need to do anything other than upgrade
git-annex to recover from the problem. On the other hand, if the potential
that a un-encrypted filename of a git-annex key having leaked into a server
log somewhere is a problem, I don't have a solution to the problem. :-/
