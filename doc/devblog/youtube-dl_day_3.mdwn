Finished up youtube-dl integration today, including all the edge cases in
`addurl` and honoring annex.diskreserve.

I changed my mind about `git annex addurl --relaxed`; it seems better for
it to be slower than before, but not have surprising behavior, than to be
fast but potentially surprising. If it's too slow, add `--raw` to avoid
using youtube-dl.
