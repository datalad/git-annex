Today started with getting a release of git-annex out, to deal with a new
version of the aws library, which broke the build. That also added support
to the S3 remotes for creating Google Nearline buckets, although only when
git-annex is built with the newest version of the aws library.

Rest of the day (and most of the past weekend) I've been working on the
concurrent-output library. Today I finished making it support multi-line
regions, and color, and even fully optimised its console updates to use
minimal bandwidth. So, it's got everything git-annex can possibly need
to display those troublesome concurrent actions. Will be starting to make
git-annex use it soon!
