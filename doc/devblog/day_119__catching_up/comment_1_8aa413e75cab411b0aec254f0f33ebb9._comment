When the [[metadata design|day_112__metadata_design]] stuff appeared on the blog I didn't understand what you meant by automatically creating new tree layouts.  I'm really liking these views and can already imagine how useful it would be to tag my photos by person/place/time.  This is awesome!  Keep up the good work.
