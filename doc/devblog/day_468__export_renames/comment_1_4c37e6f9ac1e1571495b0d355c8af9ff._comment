Looking forward to the export support! 

Just curious (and I apologize in advance for any nightmares induced) did you consider the case of four files, Aâ€“D, where (content-wise) A=B and C=D and the change is to swap A/C and B/D? That'd potentially be an issue, since four files want to share two temporary names. Unless of course it's all only done with pairwise swaps.
