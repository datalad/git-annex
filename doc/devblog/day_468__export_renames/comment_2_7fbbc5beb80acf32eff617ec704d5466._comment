Did not consider such a case. However, that's closely related to exporting
files with same content being inefficient. There's a move
operation but no copy operation. I might add a copy operation eventually,
unsure.

If a copy operation is added, then that rename case can be handled more
efficiently, by moving to the single temp file and copying. Although it
might still involve the special remote doing more work than strictly
necessary depending on how it implements copy.

Anyway, if the user is exporting copys of files, they're probably going to
care more about that being somewhat more efficient than about renames of
pairs of those copies being optimally efficient..

Handling it fully optimally, with only one temp file per key,
would require analizing the change and finding pairs of renames
that swap filenames and handling each pair in turn. I suppose that
is doable, just needs a better data structure than I have now.
I've added a note to my todo list and the design document, but
no promises.
