Windows *does* have something very much like symlinks – they're called *symlinks* (\"symbolic links\") and they are meant to [\"function just like UNIX links\"][1] as the official docs say.

But on the other hand, yes – `isSymlink` makes less sense on Windows, because symlinks are just a type of reparse points, and there may be several other types (e.g. directory junctions should also be treated like symlinks, but mount points shouldn't...)
