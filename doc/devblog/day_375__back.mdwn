Back from Libreplanet and a week of spring break. Backlog is not too bad
for two weeks mostly away; 143 messages.

Finally got the OSX app updated for the git security fix yesterday. Had to
drop builds for old OSX releases.

Getting back into working on adjusted branches now. Polishing up the UI and
docs today. Nearly ready to merge the feature; the only blocker is there
seems to be something a little bit wrong with how pulled changes are merged
into the adjusted branch that I noticed in testing.
