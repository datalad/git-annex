thanks for the review! great to see those surveys every once in a while...

i wonder if [[todo/build_a_user_guide/]] could help with the documentation. the [[todo]] and [[forum]] pages are useful, but they are more \"search\" based than a handbook would be. there is the [[walkthrough]], but it could cover a *lot* more ground and i am not sure the wiki format is appropriate for this...
