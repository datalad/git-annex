If you've been keeping an eye on the [[design/roadmap]], you'll have seen that
[[design/assistant/xmpp_security]] keeps being pushed back. This was because
it's a hard and annoying problem requiring custom crypto and with an
ugly key validation problem built into it too. I've now removed it from the
roadmap entirely, replacing it with a [[design/assistant/telehash]] design.

I'm excited by the possibilities of using telehash with git-annex. It seems
it would be quite easy to make it significantly more peer-to-peer and
flexible. The only issue is that telehash is still under heavy
development and the C implementation is not even usable yet..
(I'll probably end up writing Haskell bindings to that.)
So I've pushed it down the roadmap to at least March.

Spent the rest of the day making some minor improvements to external special
remote protocol and doing some other minor bug fixes and backlog catch up.
My backlog has exploded to nearly 50 messages remaining.
