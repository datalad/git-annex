It uses whatever youtube-dl you have in PATH.

I was not aware of the changed behavior when adding an url that's already
locally present. I've opened [[bugs/addurl_youtube-dl_behavior_change]]
to remember to look into it.

The reason it only downloads one video from a playlist or channel is that
git-annex needs to associate an url with the annexed file, so it can later
download that single file when git-annex get is used, and there's no clear
way to associate an url with a particular file that youtube-dl downloaded
from a playlist or channel or whatever. [[tips/downloading_podcasts]] has a
way to use `git annex importfeed` with a youtube playlist though.
