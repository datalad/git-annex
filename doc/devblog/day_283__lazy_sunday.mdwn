Lazy afternoon spent porting git-anenx to build under ghc 7.10. Required
rather a lot of changes to build, and even more to build cleanly after the
AMP transition.

Unfortunately, ghc 7.10 has started warning about every line that uses tab
for indentation. I had to add additional cruft to turn those warnings off
everywhere, and cannot say I'm happy about this at all.
