I just also (like others) wanna state my strong interest in a windows port. Actually it's the only thing which is holding me back of using git-annex for real, as I live and work in a mixed-OS environment. The git-annex features would be the answers to an awful lot of our day-to-day problems, and I cannot wait to have it ready for a production environment. So -> Windows Port +1
