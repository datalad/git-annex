Mostly spent today getting to older messages in the backlog. This did
result in a few fixes, but with 97 old messages left, I can feel the
diminishing returns setting in, to try to understand old bug reports that
are often unclear or lacking necessary info to reproduce them.

By the way, if you feel your bug report or question has gotten lost in my
backlog, the best thing to do is post an update to it, and help me
reproduce it, or clarify it.

Moved on to looking through [[todo]], which was a more productive
way to find useful things to work on. 

Best change made today is that `git annex unused` can now be configured to
look at the reflog. So, old versions of files are considered still used
until the reflog expires. If you've wanted a way to only delete (or move
away) unused files after they get to a certian age, this is a way to do that ...
