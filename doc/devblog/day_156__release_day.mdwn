I hope this will be a really good release. Didn't get all the way to
[[design/assistant/telehash]] this month, but the remotedaemon is pretty sweet. Updated [[design/roadmap]]
pushes telehash back again.

The files in this release are now gpg signed, after recently moving the
downloads site to a dedicated server, which has a dedicated gpg key.
You can verify the detached signatures as an additional security check
over trusting SSL. The automatic upgrade code doesn't check the gpg
signatures yet.

SÃ¶ren Brunk has ported the webapp to Bootstrap 3.

The branch is not ready for merging yet (it would break the Debian stable
backports), but that was a nice surprise.
