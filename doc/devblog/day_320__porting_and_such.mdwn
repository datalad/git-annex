Lots of porting work ongoing recently:

* I've been working with [Goeke](http://www.goeke.net/) on building git-annex
  on Solaris/SmartOS. Who knows, this may lead to a binary distribution
  in some way, but to start with I got the disk free space code ported
  to Solaris, and have seen git-annex work there.
* Jirib has also been working on that same disk free code, porting it to
  OpenBSD. Hope to land an updated patch for that.
* Yury kindly updated the Windows autobuilder to a new Haskell Platform
  release, and I was able to land the `winprocfix` branch that fixes
  ssh password prompting in the webapp on Windows.
* The arm autobuilder is fixed and back in its colo, and should be making
  daily builds again.
