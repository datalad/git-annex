New AWS region in Germany announced today. git-annex doesn't support it
yet, unless you're using the `s3-aws` branch.

I cleaned up that branch, got it building again, and re-tested it with
`testremote`, and then fixed a problem the test suite found that was
caused by some changes in the haskell aws library.

Unfortunately, s3-aws is [not ready to be merged](http://git-annex.branchable.com/bugs/new_AWS_region___40__eu-central-1__41__)
because of some cabal dependency problems involving `dbus` and `random`. I did
go ahead and update Debian's haskell-aws package to cherry-pick
from a newer version the change needed for Inernet Archive
support, which allows building the s3-aws branch on Debian.
Getting closer..
