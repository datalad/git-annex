Spent the day catching up on the last week or so's traffic. Ended up
making numerous small big fixes and improvements. Message backlog stands at
44.

Here's the [[screencast demoing views|videos/git-annex_views_demo]]!

Added to the design today the idea of
automatically deriving metadata from the location of files in the master
branch's directory tree. Eg, `git annex view tag=* podcasts/=*` in a
repository that has a `podcasts/` directory would make a tree like
"$tag/$podcast". Seems promising. 

So much still to do with views.. I have belatedly added them to
the roadmap for this month; doing Windows and Android in the same month was
too much to expect.
