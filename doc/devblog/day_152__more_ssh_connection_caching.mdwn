Made ssh connection caching be used in several more places. `git annex
sync` will use it when pushing/pulling to a remote, as will the assistant.
And `git-annex remotedaemon` also uses connection caching. So, when
a push lands on a ssh remote, the assistant will immediately notice it, and
pull down the change over the same TCP connection used for the
notifications.

This was a bit of a pain to do. Had to set `GIT_SSH=git-annex` and then
when git invokes git-annex as ssh, it runs ssh with the connection caching
parameters.

Also, improved the network-manager and wicd code, so it detects when a
connection has gone down. That propigates through to the remote-daemon,
which closes all ssh connections. I need to also find out how to detect
network connections/disconnections on OSX..

Otherwise, the remote-control branch seems ready to be merged. But I want
to test it for a while first.

Followed up on yesterday's bug with writing some test cases for
Utility.Scheduled, which led to some more bug fixes. Luckily nothing
I need to rush out a release over. In the end, the code got a lot
simpler and clearer.
