With some help from SÃ¶ren, have been redoing the android build environment
for git-annex. This included making propellor put it in a docker container,
which was easy. But then much struggling with annoying stuff like getting
the gnutls linking to work, and working around some dependency issues on
hackage that make cabal's dependency resolver melt down.
Finally succeeded after much more time than I had wanted to spend on this.
