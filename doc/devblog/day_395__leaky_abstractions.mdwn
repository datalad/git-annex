Release today includes a last-minute fix to parsing lines from the
git-annex branch that might have one or more carriage returns at the end.
This comes from Windows of course, where since some things transparently
add/remove `\r` before the end of lines, while other things don't,
it could result in quite a mess. Luckily it was not hard or expensive to
handle. If you are lucky enough not to use Windows, the release also
has several more interesting improvements.
