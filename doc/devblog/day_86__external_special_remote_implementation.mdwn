Built most of the external special remote today. While I've written 600
lines of code for this, and think it's probably working, and complete
(except for a couple of features), all I know is that it compiles.

I've also written an [[example external special remote program in shell script|special_remotes/external/example.sh]],
so the next step is to put the two together and see how it works.
I also hope that some people who have built hook special remotes
in the past will update them to the new external special remote interface,
which is quite a lot better.

Today's work was sponsored by Justine Lam.
