Made a release yesterday, which was all bugfixes.

Today, a few more bug fixes. Looked into making the webapp
create non-bare repositories on removable drives, but before I got too far
into the code, I noticed [there's a big problem with that idea](http://git-annex.branchable.com/forum/usability:_creating_an_archive_on_a_new_external_drive/).

Rest of day was spent getting caught up on forum posts etc. I'm happy to
read lots of good answers that have been posted while I've been away.
Here's an excellent example: <http://git-annex.branchable.com/install/fromsource/#comment-5f8ceb060643ae71cd2adc72f0fca3f0>

That led to rewriting the docs for building git-annex from source.
New page: [[install/fromsource]].

Backlog is now down to 117.
