Been on reduced activity the past several days. I did spend a full day
somewhere in there building the Tahoe LAFS special remote. Also, Tobias has
finished updating his full suite of external special remotes to use the new
interface!

Worked on closing up the fundraising campaign today (long overdue).
This included adding a new wall-o-names to [[/thanks]].
