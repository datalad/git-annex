After making a release yesterday, I've been fixing some bugs in the
webapp, all to do with repository configuration stored on the git-annex
branch. I was led into this by a strange little bug where the webapp stored
configuration in the wrong repo in one situation. From there, I noticed
that often when enabling an existing repository, the webapp would stomp on
its group and preferred content and description, replacing them with
defaults.

This was a systematic problem, it had to be fixed in several places. And
some of the fixes were quite tricky. For example, when adding a ssh
repository, and it turns out there's already a git-annex repository at the
entered location, it needs to avoid changing its configuration. But also,
the configuration of that repo won't be known until after the first git
pull from it. So it doesn't make sense to show the repository edit form
after enabling such a repository.

Also worked on a couple other bugs, and further cleaned up the [[bugs]]
page. I think I am finally happy with how the bug list is displayed,
with confirmed/moreinfo/etc tags.

Today's work was sponsored by Fran√ßois Deppierraz.
