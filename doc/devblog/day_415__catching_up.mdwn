Catching up on backlog today. I hope to be back to a regular work schedule
now. Unanswered messages down to 156. A lot of time today spent answering
questions.

There were several problems involving git branches with slashes in their
name, such as "foo/bar" (but not "origin/master" or "refs/heads/foo").
Some branch names based on such a branch would take only the "bar" part.
In `git annex sync`, this led to perhaps merging "foo/bar" into "other/bar"
or "bar". And the adjusted branch code was entirely broken for such
branches. I've fixed it now.

Also made `git annex addurl` behave better when the file it wants to 
add is gitignored.

Thinking about implementing `git annex copy --from A --to B`.
It does not seem *too* hard to do that, at least with a temp file
used inbetween. See [[todo/transitive_transfers]].
