Git annex transfers over Tor worked correctly the first time I tried them
today. I had been expecting protocol implementation bugs, so this was a
nice surprise!

Of course there were some bugs to fix. I had forgotten to add UUID
discovery to `git annex p2p --link`. And, resuming interrupted transfers
was buggy.

Spent some time adding progress updates to the Tor remote. I was curious to
see what speed transfers would run. Speed will of course vary depending on
the Tor relays being used, but this example with a 100 mb file is not bad:

	copy big4 (to peer1...) 
	62%          1.5MB/s 24s

There are still a couple of [[known bugs|todo/tor]], 
but I've merged the `tor` branch into `master` already.
