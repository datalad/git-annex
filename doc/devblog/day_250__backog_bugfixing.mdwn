Plowing through the backlog today, and fixing quite a few bugs! Got the
backlog down to 87 messages from ~140. And some of the things I got to were
old and/or hard.

About a third of the day was spent revisiting
[[bugs/git-annex_branch_shows_commit_with_looong_commitlog]].
I still don't understand how that behavior can happen, but I have a
donated repository where it did happen. Made several changes to try to make
the problem less likely to occur, and not as annoying when it does occur,
and maybe get me more info if it does happen to someone again.
