Over the past couple days, got the arm autobuilder working again. It had
been down since June with several problems. cabal install tended to crash;
apparenty this has something to do with threading in user-mode qemu,
because -j1 avoids that. And strange invalid character problems were fixed
by downgrading file-embed. Also, with Yury's help I got the Windows
autobuilder upgraded to the new Haskell Platform and working again.

Today a last few finishing touches, including getting rid of the last
dependency on the old haskell HTTP library, since http-conduit is being
used now. Ready for the release!
