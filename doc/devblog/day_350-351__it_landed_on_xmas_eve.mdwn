If you've got some free holiday time, the v6 repository mode is now
available in many of the daily builds, and there's documentation at
[[tips/unlocked_files]]. It would be very useful now if you can give
it a try. Use a clone or new repository for safety.

Yesterday I checked all parts of the code that special case direct mode,
and found a few things that needed adjusting for v6 unlocked files. Today,
I added the annex.thin config. Around 4 other major todo items need to be
dealt with before this is ready for more than early adopters.
