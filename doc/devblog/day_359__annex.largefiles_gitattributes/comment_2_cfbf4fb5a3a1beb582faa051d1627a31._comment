Weirdly, that hack wouldn't work if I had used a more lisp-style format for
the expressions. At least, I don't think lisp can be written with no
whitespace at all, in general. It was just luck that the expression format
happened to work out that way.

Anyway, it's a hack, but it works. Would be nice if git got a way to put
spaces in gitattribute values..
