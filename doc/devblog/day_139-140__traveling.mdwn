Yesterday coded up one nice improvement on the plane -- `git annex unannex`
(and `uninit`) is now tons faster. Before it did a git commit after every
file processed, now there's just 1 commit at the end. This required using
some locking to prevent the `pre-commit` hook from running in a confusing
state.

Today. LibrePlanet and a surprising amount of development. I've
added [[tips/file_manager_integration]], only for Nautilus so far.
The main part of this was adding --notify-start and --notify-finish, which
use dbus desktop notifications to provide feedback. 

(Made possible thanks to Max Rabkin for updating
[fdo-notify](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/fdo-notify) to use the
new dbus library, and ion for developing the initial Nautilus integration
scripts.)

Today's work and LibrePlanet visit was sponsored by Jürgen Lüters.
