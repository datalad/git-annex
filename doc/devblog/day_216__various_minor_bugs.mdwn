Working on getting caught up with backlog. 73 messages remain.

Several minor bugs were fixed today. All edge cases. The most edge case one
of all, I could not fix: git-annex cannot add a file that has a newline
in its filename, because `git cat-file --batch`'s interface does not support such
filenames.

Added a page [[documenting how verify the signatures of git-annex releases|install/verifying_downloads]].

Over the past couple days, all the autobuilders have been updated to new
dependencies needed by the recent work. Except for Windows, which needs to
be updated to the new Haskell Platform first, so hopefully soon.

Turns out that upgrading unix-compat means that inode(like) numbers are
available even on Windows, which will make git-annex more robust there.
Win win. ;)
