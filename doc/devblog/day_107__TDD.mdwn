A more test driven day than usual. Yesterday I noticed a test case was
failing on Windows in a way not related to what it was intended to test,
and fixed the test case to not fail.. But knew I'd need to get to the
bottom of what broke it eventually.

Digging into that today, I eventually (after rather a long time stuck)
determined the bug involved automatic conflict resolution, but only
happened on systems without symlink support. This let me reproduce it on
FAT outside Windows and do some fast TDD iterations in a much less
unwieldly environment and fix the bug.
