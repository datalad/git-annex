Working through the forum posts and bugs. Backlog is down to 95.

Discovered the first known security hole in git-annex!
Turns out that S3 and Glacier remotes that were configured with embedcreds=yes and encryption=pubkey or encryption=hybrid
didn't actually encrypt the AWS credentials that get embedded into the git
repo. This doesn't affect any repos set up by the assistant.

I've fixed the problem and am going to make a release soon.
If your repo is affected, see 
[[upgrades/insecure_embedded_creds]] for what to do about it.
