Worked through message backlog today. Got it down from around 70 to just
37. Was able to fix some bugs, including making the webapp start up more
robustly in some misconfigurations.

Added a new `findref` command which may be useful in a git `update` hook to
deny pushes of refs if the annexed content has not been sent first.

BTW, I also added a new `reinit` command a few days ago, which can be
useful if you're cloning back a deleted repository.

Also a few days ago, I made `uninit` a *lot* faster.
