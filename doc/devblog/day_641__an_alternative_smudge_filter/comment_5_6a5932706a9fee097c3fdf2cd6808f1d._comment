Until this is ready, at the moment, I got around the slowness [by setting](https://github.com/neuropoly/intranet.neuro.polymtl.ca/blob/d5c320c/geek-tips/git-annex.md#new-repo)

```
cat > .gitattributes <<EOF
*.mkv   filter=anex annex.largefiles=anything
*.mp3   filter=anex annex.largefiles=anything
EOF
```

This way the file size is ignored and instead git makes the decision for me based on file extension. This is much faster than running every file through `git annex smudge`. I'

I might end up sticking with this even if you use the faster filter API.
