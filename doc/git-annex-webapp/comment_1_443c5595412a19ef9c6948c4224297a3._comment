I have gotten as far as running `git init` and `git annex init` on my server. There&rsquo;s a bunch of stuff there and I figure I&rsquo;ll just add the things that I care about as I go.

I read the page on the [webapp](https://git-annex.branchable.com/git-annex-webapp/) and it just says that it &ldquo;allows easy setup of a git-annex repository, and control of the git-annex assistant&rdquo;. I started the webapp on my server and I was alarmed to see a message in the webapp that it was adding things to git annex. Over on the page for the [git annex assistant](https://git-annex.branchable.com/git-annex-assistant/) it says &ldquo;By default, all new files in the directory will be added to the repository&rdquo; which is definitely not what I expected. I&rsquo;m a new user trying to learn how to use git annex and this was an unpleasant surprise. Can we amend the docs for the webapp to warn about this behavior?
