### use case: The Nomad

Alice is always on the move, often with her trusty netbook and a small
handheld terabyte USB drive, or a smaller USB keydrive. She has a server
out there on the net. She stores data, encrypted in the Cloud.

All these things can have different files on them, but Alice no longer
has to deal with the tedious process of keeping them manually in sync,
or remembering where she put a file. git-annex manages all these data
sources as if they were git remotes.

When she has 1 bar on her cell, Alice queues up interesting files on her
server for later. At a coffee shop, she has git-annex download them to her
USB drive. High in the sky or in a remote cabin, she catches up on
podcasts, videos, and games, first letting git-annex copy them from
her USB drive to the netbook (this saves battery power).

When she's done, she tells git-annex which to keep and which to remove.
They're all removed from her netbook to save space, and Alice knows
that next time she syncs up to the net, her changes will be synced back 
to her server.
