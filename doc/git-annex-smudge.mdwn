# NAME

git-annex smudge - git filter driver for git-annex

# SYNOPSIS

git annex smudge [--clean] file

# DESCRIPTION

This command lets git-annex be used as a git filter driver which lets
annexed files in the git repository to be unlocked at all times, instead
of being symlinks.

When adding a file with `git add`, the annex.largefiles config is
consulted to decide if a given file should be added to git as-is,
or if its content are large enough to need to use git-annex.

The git configuration to use this command as a filter driver is as follows.
This is normally set up for you by git-annex init, so you should
not need to configure it manually.

	[filter "annex"]
	        smudge = git-annex smudge %f
	        clean = git-annex smudge --clean %f

To make git use that filter driver, it needs to be configured in
the `.gitattributes` file or in `.git/info/attributes`. The latter
is normally configured when a repository is initialized, with the following
contents:

	* filter=annex
	.* !filter
