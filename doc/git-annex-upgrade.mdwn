# NAME

git-annex upgrade - upgrade repository

# SYNOPSIS

git annex upgrade

# DESCRIPTION

Upgrades the repository.

Each git-annex repository has an annex.version in its git configuration,
that indicates the repository version. When an old repository version
becomes deprecated, git-annex will automatically upgrade it
(unless annex.autoupgraderepository is set to false). To manually upgrade,
you can use this command.

Sometimes there's a newer repository version that is not the default yet,
and then you can use this command to upgrade to it.

Currently, git-annex supports upgrades all the way back to version 0, which
was only used by its author. It's expected that git-annex will always
support upgrading from all past repository versions -- this is necessary to
allow archives to be taken offline for years and later used.
