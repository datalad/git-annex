# NAME

git-annex upgrade - upgrade repository layout

# SYNOPSIS

git annex upgrade

# DESCRIPTION

Upgrades the repository to current layout.

Each git-annex repository has an annex.version in its git configuration,
that indicates the repository version. If git-annex changes to a new
layout, you must upgrade the repository before git-annex can be used in it.

To see version information, run `git annex version`. 

Currently, git-annex supports upgrades all the way back to version 0, which
was only used by its author. It's expected that git-annex will always
support upgrading from all past repository versions -- this is necessary to
allow archives to be taken offline for years and later used.
