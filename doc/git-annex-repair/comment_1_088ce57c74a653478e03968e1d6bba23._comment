When you run into weird `no space left on device` errors although there clearly **is** enough room on your disk while running `git annex repair`, it probably means that your `/tmp` is too small (You can verify with `watch -n0 df -h` or just `df -h`). You can instruct `git annex repair` to use a different directory for intermediate storage via the `TMPDIR` environment variable:

```bash
mkdir /path/to/dir/with/enough/space
TMPDIR=/path/to/dir/with/enough/space git annex repair
# Now that new dir is used and the 'no space left on device' error should disappear
```

Might be worth adding a note for `TMPDIR` to the `git annex repair` manpage, @joey?
