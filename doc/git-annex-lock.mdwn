# NAME

git-annex lock - lock files to prevent modification

# SYNOPSIS

git annex lock `[path ...]`

# DESCRIPTION

Lock the specified annexed files, to prevent them from being modified.
When no files are specified, all annexed files in the current directory are
locked.

Locking a file changes how it is stored in the git repository (from a
pointer file to a symlink), so this command will make a change that you
can commit.

# OPTIONS

* file matching options
 
  The [[git-annex-matching-options]](1)
  can be used to specify files to lock.

* `--json`

  Enable JSON output. This is intended to be parsed by programs that use
  git-annex. Each line of output is a JSON object.

* `--json-error-messages`

  Messages that would normally be output to standard error are included in
  the JSON instead.

* Also the [[git-annex-common-options]](1) can be used.
