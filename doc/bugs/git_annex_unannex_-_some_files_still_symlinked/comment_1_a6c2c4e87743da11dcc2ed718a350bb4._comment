Solution with running `git annex add` is also described at the link below:

So need to find files that are symlinks to git annex object folder and run `git annex add` / `git annex unused` - I can handle that with a script, though would be nice to have a built-in method

---

Additional notes:

1. There should be a way to find files that were added to git annex folder but are not tracked by git annex. Is this something that can be done with existing commands?
2. It's desirable to have a way to abort `git annex add` gracefully on long-running jobs. Is there a way to do it now? Looks like ctrl-c resulted in a broken state. Whould Ctrl-z work better?
