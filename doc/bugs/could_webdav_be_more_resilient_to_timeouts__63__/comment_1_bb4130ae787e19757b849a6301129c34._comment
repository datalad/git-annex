This last came up in 2014, at the time I disabled the http response timeout
entirely with setResponseTimeout Nothing.

Looking at Network.Protocol.HTTP.DAV.setResponseTimeout:

	setResponseTimeout :: MonadIO m => Maybe Int -> DAVT m ()
	#if MIN_VERSION_http_client(0,5,0)
	setResponseTimeout rt = baseRequest %= \x -> x { responseTimeout = maybe responseTimeoutDefault responseTimeoutMicro rt }
	#else
	setResponseTimeout rt = baseRequest %= \x -> x { responseTimeout = rt }
	#endif

Looks like with recent http-client versions in the case of Nothing, rather
than disabling the timeout, it now defaults to responseTimeoutDefault.
Which is 30 seconds. Since I'm passing it Nothing to try to disable the
timeout, that's kind of a problem! 

I feel this is a bug in the DAV library. I could try to work around it
with `Just maxBound`, that's many years worth of microseconds on 64 bit, but
on 32 bit, it's somewhere under 10 minutes, which is really not good
enough when the goal is to disable timeouts at this level entirely.
