Thank you for the changes Joey, I can confirm that it's working and I've added this to the garage docs: https://git.deuxfleurs.fr/Deuxfleurs/garage/pulls/502

I did however have to change git-annex's stack.yaml as follows to make this compile:

```
diff --git a/stack.yaml b/stack.yaml

On my machine, it wasn't happy about the aeson version without the lts bump and I also hit the bug at https://github.com/snoyberg/http-client/issues/482 hence the http-client change.

I believe that this is actually an AWS thing, as it's extensively used in their Python and Rust SDKs: https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sdk-rust/blob/66423e05991ee831696bc32fe3e452694cf0d231/sdk/s3/src/config.rs#L98
