> It's working, because presumably AWS accept 's3.amazon.com' as a region setting for the scope in their cloud.

I doubt it; that's not what aws sends to it.

Just to be clear, comment #5 is me fully understanding the problem
and escalating the issue to the relevant library. Further speculation
would probably muddy the water.

Thanks for clarifying that "scope" is internal jargon of garage though.
Also it's good to know that `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION` is a commonly used
environment variable for it.
