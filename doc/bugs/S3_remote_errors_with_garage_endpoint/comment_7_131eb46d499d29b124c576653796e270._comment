> s3ExtractRegion parses a hostname like \"s3-foo.amazonaws.com\" to \"foo\", and that is used as the region (or \"scope\" as you've called it).

I'd also like to clarify this bit in that what I mean by \"scope\" is that line in the error message from the backend:

```
s3ErrorMessage = \"Authorization header malformed, expected scope: 20230118/my-s3-endpoint.domain.com/s3/aws4_request\"
```

git-annex is incorrectly setting the FQDN/endpoint of the service in this, instead of what garage and the linked Haskell library want here after the date which is the region.
