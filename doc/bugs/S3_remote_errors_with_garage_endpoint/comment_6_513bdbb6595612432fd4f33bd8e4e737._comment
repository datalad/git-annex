> Firstly, this code is working, as far as I know, when accessing AWS.

It's working, because presumably AWS accept 's3.amazon.com' as a region setting for the scope in their cloud.

My S3 endpoint is indeed the FQDN of my self-hosted S3 endpoint. My \"AWS region\" is \"garage\".

To give exact examples, this is what I configure in my environment when interacting with garage with any other S3 utility:
 
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=foo
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=bar
export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION='garage'
export AWS_ENDPOINT='https://my-s3-endpoint.example.com/'

The region bit is what's added to the credentialV4 in Core.hs (and what AWS appear to also accept as s3.amazon.com(? - I do not have an AWS account to test this). To make git-annex work, I need to do the equivalent of this (after changing garage's configuration):

export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION='my-s3-endpoint.example.com'

Once I do this, awscli and every other tool breaks:

$ aws s3 ls s3://
Provided region_name 'my-s3-endpoint.example.com' doesn't match a supported format.

> s3SignQuery also has region = s3ExtractRegion s3Endpoint. s3ExtractRegion parses a hostname like \"s3-foo.amazonaws.com\" to \"foo\", and that is used as the region (or \"scope\" as you've called it).
>
> git-annex makes sure to set s3Endpoint to a hostname. When the default AWS hostname is used, it converts the datacenter=foo value to a hostname like s3-foo.amazonaws.com and sets s3Endpoint to that. When some other hostname= is provided, it set s3Endpoints to that hostname, ignoring the datacenter= value.

It might be best to deprecate datacenter= and add region= directly to match AWS parlance

> This seems like the only thing git-annex can do. Your proposed patch would make a configuration of \"datacenter=us-west-1\" set s3Endpoint to \"us-west-1\" and s3SignQuery would use that as the host.

What I'd really like to test is just being able to set datacenter=garage but with my change it's not accepted as a [Char].
