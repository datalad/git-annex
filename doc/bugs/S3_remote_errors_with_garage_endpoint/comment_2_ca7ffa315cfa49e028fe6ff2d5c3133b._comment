I took a look at the credentialv4 structure at https://github.com/aristidb/aws/blob/9bdc4ee018d0d9047c0434eeb21e2383afaa9ccf/Aws/Core.hs#L621 and found it curious that it has the region inside the scope (as the garage code) does... however in my error message from git-annex - the hostname of the S3 service is what's inside the scope instead of the 'garage' region name.

I therefore adjusted the garage API's configuration to have the FQDN as the region and then... git-annex Just Worked.
