In my case i was going to make a script for automatically downloading and updating an git portbale / git annex instance, by first fetching git portbale and then downloading the gitannex exe.

So yeah it's more reliable to extract an archive rather than trying to extract the setup without executing it.
That's why i'm asking for this feature. :)
