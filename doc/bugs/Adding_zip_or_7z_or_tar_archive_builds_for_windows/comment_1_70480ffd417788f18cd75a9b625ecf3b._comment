It would be helpful to have more details, such as an example of software
distributed for windows that way, or documentation of how such an archive
is used on windows.

The git-annex Windows installer is a exe file that uses the NullSoft
installation system. As far as I know that's pretty common in the Windows
world.

I don't see any point in zipping up the single exe. It would be possible to
make a zip containing all the files that instlling the exe installs. But,
the installation process has to integrate git-annex with git, it installs
menu items, etc. A zip file would not be able to handle that integration.
So its use seems limited to me.
