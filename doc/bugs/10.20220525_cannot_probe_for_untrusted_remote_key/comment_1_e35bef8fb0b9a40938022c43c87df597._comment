That was a fix for an old reversion, so trying to use fsck for that would
have also failed before 8.20201129.

Fsck is not the right tool for the job. Fscking can fail for any of a
variety of reasons, including probably reasons that have not been thought
of or implemented yet, so taking failure to mean only one possible thing is
doomed.

A better tool exists: `git-annex checkpresentkey`
