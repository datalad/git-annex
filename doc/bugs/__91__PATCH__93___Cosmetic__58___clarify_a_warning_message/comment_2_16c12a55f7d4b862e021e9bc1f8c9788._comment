It wasn't clear to me that this was just a warning, i.e. that functionality wasn't compromised.  The part after the semicolon kind of implies that, but it seems clearer to say so explicitly.

On second thought, though, the rephrasing probably isn't necessary. Just adding the \"Warning:\" prefix would suffice...
