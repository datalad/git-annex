So, the missing bit of data needed to reproduce this is that
~/astro.git didn't exist at all before this initremote call.

If you `git init --bare ~/astro.git` first, it works fine.

The documentation says, of gitrepo:

	This repository should be either empty, or an existing gcrypt repositry.

So, I don't know if this is really a bug, you're not doing what the
documentation says to do.

I suppose git-annex initremote could create a bare repository when none exists
in this case, but it would then have to parse the gitrepo parameter, normalize
it, use the approptiate protocol (file, ssh, rsync) to check if it exists or
create it, etc, instead of simply passing it to gcrypt.

(What is actually going on here is, gcrypt supports remotes that are not git repositories at all.
When the repo doesn't exist, it assumes such a remote is wanted and makes one.
But, git-annex does not support working with that kind of gcrypt remote.)
