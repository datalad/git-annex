I've successfully reproduced the error.

Steps:

1. Create 5k small files using a script. (I used one given here: <https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/199863/create-many-files-with-random-content> )
2. Init git and git-annex
3. Add files to git-annex. **The error occurs here** after/while (recording state in git...)

If no error occurs, try increasing the number of files to 10k or more.

I ran both *status* and *fsck* in both git and git-annex, with no errors, so AFAIK it hasn't corrupted anything.
