I tried running initremote without a tty, and it worked ok,
using the following test case:

	#!/bin/sh
	set -e
	cd /tmp/r
	pwd
	git annex initremote test type=directory directory=../d encryption=hybrid keyid=2512E3C7 --fast --debug >/dev/null

So, I need more information to reproduce this.

It seems likely that, if gpg is trying to read from the tty, it needs to
prompt for your key's passphrase for some reason. In which case setting
--batch would only make it fail differently. If you want to script
something that needs access to your gpg secret key, you need to configure
gpg to use a gpg agent.
