What steps will reproduce the problem?

Create a new remote repository in the webapp. Get to the final phase of the setup where it asks you if you want to encrypt it, yet no other option is given to continue.

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?

At least two options:

1. Use an encrypted rsync repository on the server (the existing one)
2. Use an unencrypted rsync repository on the server
