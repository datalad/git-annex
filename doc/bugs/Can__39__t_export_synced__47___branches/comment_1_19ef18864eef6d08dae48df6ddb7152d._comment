The difficulty here is that it needs to come up with the name of a
corresponding remote tracking branch to update. It could use 
"myexport/synced/main" for that. But, setting `annex-tracking-branch` to
a remote ref like "origin/main" is not supported, and it would not be good
if it allowed it and used a tracking branch with a name like
"myexport/origin/main".

And well, we know that "synced/main" is not a remote ref, but "$foo/main"
generally may or may not be one.

So, I think to support this, it would have only allow using "$foo/main"
when the ref "refs/remotes/$foo/main" does not exist. I've implemented
that.
