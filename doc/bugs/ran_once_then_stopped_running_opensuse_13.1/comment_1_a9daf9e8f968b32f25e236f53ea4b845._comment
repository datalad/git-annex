There's a bit of a dearth of information here. I think I need to know:

* What the version is (output of `git annex version`)

* What happens when you run `git annex webapp` (\"does nothing\" is very vague. Does it sit there forever without returning to the prompt? Print an error message? Open a web browser that's not usable somehow?)

You might take a look at the file `~/.config/git-annex/autostart` and remove any repository you deleted from there, although normally git-annex will ignore entries that no longer exist.
