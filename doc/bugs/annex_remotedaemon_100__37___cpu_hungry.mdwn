### Please describe the problem.

Rebooted my laptop recently (after dunno how long of uptime) and annex assistant was shut off in previous uptime, but this time decided to leave it running. spotted that laptop is hot today to see that git-annex is busy.  And I am not sure what it is really doing:  top says

in webapp I saw it struggling to connect  to vagus which is offline, I turned it off, then reanabled syncing to above yoh@git-annex-andy-yoh_.2Fmedia.2FVault.2Fannex .  I don't know if annex was busier or not before, but it is 100% busy now, but nothing seems to be done -- no traffic, no changing fd's for that annex process

strace shows busy reading from fd 24:

so what could it be doing?
