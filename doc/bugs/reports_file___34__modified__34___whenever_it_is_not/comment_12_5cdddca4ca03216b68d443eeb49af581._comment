Adding a matrix run where I initiated a custom config settings to our [datalad/git-annex](https://github.com/datalad/git-annex/pull/133) CI run.  Let's see how that goes.  May be some other interesting config settings to add there? e.g. retries etc?  or global `~/.gitconfig` is not used/mocked away during tests? (e.g. we do that in datalad, so I had to trick that in [PR against datalad](https://github.com/datalad/datalad/pull/7056) to test against this setting being set)
