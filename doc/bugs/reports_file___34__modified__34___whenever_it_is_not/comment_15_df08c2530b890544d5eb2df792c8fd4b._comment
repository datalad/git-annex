@yarikoptic oh, `git-annex test` does prevent global gitconfig from
influeencing the tests. So your matrix test won't work if you're
running `git-annex test` in it. If you're running other git-annex commands
in datalad's test suite, it would work though.

I've opened [[todo/specify_gitconfig_for_test_suite]].
