Thanks for the --debug. It shows that git-annex is not running 
`git update-index --refresh` at all.

And it shows that the transfer happens in a `git-annex transferrer` process.
So, I think you have annex.stalldetection set.

And interestingly, that transferrer process fails at the end:

Aha! I can reproduce it by setting annex.stalldetection.
