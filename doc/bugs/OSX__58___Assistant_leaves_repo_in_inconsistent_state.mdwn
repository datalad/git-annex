### Please describe the problem.
Shortly after starting the assistant the local client repository is in an inconsistent state. Just using the cli works fine without destroying the repository.

### What steps will reproduce the problem?
- Working git annex repository

- Start the Git-Annex Assistant
> git annex assistant

- Wait a short time and then check the repository state:
> ➜  annex git:(master) ✗ gst
> On branch master
> error: Could not read ea63b58d1252e3432280cdce1282eb02035c926e
> error: Could not read ea63b58d1252e3432280cdce1282eb02035c926e
> fatal: Failed to traverse parents of commit 108fa97a989aeabff16738558e1aa636c836598b

- refs/heads/synced/git-annex links to an unknown commit
> ➜  .git git:(master) cat refs/heads/synced/git-annex
> be8e6023fbb172b12cec8fdbaa8654194f71c4f5% 

> git show be8e6023fbb172b12cec8fdbaa8654194f71c4f5
> fatal: unable to read source tree (d2959525362dcadd4dbec96a8f18d80cc689a851)

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?
- git-annex version: 5.20150508-gf71c23f
