Yes, I did change the 'annex-tracking-branch' in the way you described. I was trying various values and I guess I expected git-annex not to keep any state after I interrupted the transfer (a few files were transfered).

I suspect the merge conflicts (on the android/master branch) were a combination of interrupting the process and changing the config back and forth. I think I could see them because my git config (name, email) is temporarily broken if the worktree is changed, which interrupted the committing.

I would expect git-annex to remember what happened only if it completed. In the case of adb, transfer is pretty slow and it's not likely to ever terminate (if I didn't meant to sync that many files, I won't wait days for it to complete).
The impacted files were all the files to be synced, only a fraction of which was actually synced.
