I noticed that even when the syncing finishes. Worse than that, the 'android/master' branch is merged into 'master'.
The removed files are brought back during the merge, but the moved files are committed.

I definitely don't want git annex to touch my master branch. I have 'autocommit = false', 'synconlyannex = true' and 'alwayscommit = false'. I take care of merging and pushing the 'git-annex' branch myself.

Perhaps I'm not using git-annex right ?
