Here's my suspicion: You started with annex-tracking-branch set to
some value, and synced. Then you changed it to some other value and synced
again.

For example, if you start with it set to master:subdirectory, then
change it to master, this happens on the subsequent sync:

	list directory ok
	update refs/remotes/directory/master ok
	
	Updating d946446..8dd4a6f
	Fast-forward
	 bigfile                           | 1 +
	 foo                               | 1 -
	 subdirectory/bigfile              | 1 -

So, files not in subdirectory get removed, and everything in subdirectory
is moved out of it and into the top of the tree.

Does this behavior make sense? I am not sure, but by changing 
annex-tracking-branch, you have certianlly ripped the rug out from under
git-annex. And that seems to more or less match what you are describing.

(Nothing to do with being interrupted, and no merge conflicts though.)
