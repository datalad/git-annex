I'm quite sure that syncing with a extporttree=yes special remote does not
alter the working tree or the usual index beyond the sync command's usual
commit of any staged changes. It writes the tree using `git mktree` 
and `git commit-tree`.

I have tried to reproduce this, without any luck. I used a directory
special remote not adb, but that should not possibly change anything.

	joey@darkstar:~/tmp/bench/ar>git-annex initremote directory type=directory directory=../d encryption=none exporttree=yes importtree=yes
	joey@darkstar:~/tmp/bench/ar>git config remote.directory.annex-tracking-branch master:subdirectory
	joey@darkstar:~/tmp/bench/ar>dd if=/dev/urandom of=subdirectory/bigfile2 bs=1M count=100
	joey@darkstar:~/tmp/bench/ar>git-annex add subdirectory/bigfile2

	joey@darkstar:~/tmp/bench/ar>git-annex sync --content
	commit 
	[master 159757a] git-annex in joey@darkstar:~/tmp/bench/ar
	 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
	 create mode 120000 subdirectory/bigfile2
	ok
	list directory ok
	update refs/remotes/directory/master ok
	
	Merge made by the 'ort' strategy.
	export directory bigfile2 ^C
	- exit 130
	joey@darkstar:~/tmp/bench/ar>git st
	On branch master
	nothing to commit, working tree clean
	joey@darkstar:~/tmp/bench/ar>ls
	foo@  subdirectory/

Also, I don't understand what you mean by this:

	This branch isn't supposed to be pushed anywhere and generates tons of conflicts every time

What do these conflicts look like? When do they happen?

Please show a transcript of the problem happening. Ideally starting with a
fresh git repository and showing all steps you used to set it up.
