I am using the latest daily build for Android 5.0

My version is Android 5.0.1 Lollipop. And I'm using a Samsung Galaxy S4 unrooted.

Trying to create a repositpory in the folder /storage/extSdCard/Music gives me a webpage with a red error badge that says:

    "Internal Server Error"
    
    git init failed

    Output:
    /storage/extSdCard/Music/.git: Permission denied

I'm pretty sure this is because of Android's crappy permission system on sd cards. But when I install the app, it tells me it is asking for
read write access to the sd card. So this consideration must have happened.



### Please describe the problem.

I am using the latest daily build for Android 5.0

I'm pretty sure this is because of Android's crappy permission system on sd cards. But when I install the app, it tells me it is asking for
read write access to the sd card. So this consideration must have happened.

### What steps will reproduce the problem?

1. Install the Android 5.0 daily build on an Android 5.0.1 phone.
2. Try to create a repo on an external sd card.

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?

Latest daily build of Android 5.0 git annex on Android 5.0.1

### Please provide any additional information below.

When I run adb shell I see the following permissions on the file in question:

    drwxrwx--- root     sdcard_r          2016-04-02 14:11 Music

Additional info. The terminal emulator shows this output:

    Falling back to hardcoded app location: cannot find expected files in /data/app/ga.androidterm-2/lib
    git annex webapp
    WARNING: linker: git-annex has text relocations. This is wasting memory and prevents security hardening. Please fix.

I have tried moving the app to the sd card, but it will not work if I do that.

### Have you had any luck using git-annex before? (Sometimes we get tired of reading bug reports all day and a lil' positive end note does wonders)

Yes! It's by far one of my favorite apps! it works very well on my laptop, on my home file server, and on my internal storage on my Android phone :)
