The last time I worked on optimising this, 
in [[todo/speed_up_keys_db_update_with_git_streaming]],
it looked like writing to sqlite was probably a large part of the remaining
time. Processing 100k new files took 41 seconds, and processing 100k
removed files took only 17 seconds. And the only difference as far as what
git-annex is doing in those cases is adding to sqlite vs removing from
sqlite.

[This comment](https://git-annex.branchable.com/todo/Avoid_lengthy___34__Scanning_for_unlocked_files_...__34__/#comment-5d4037307a3e66304cc0e8ce137e1693)
suggests using multi-value sqlite inserts as perhaps a way to speed it up.
Perhaps.
