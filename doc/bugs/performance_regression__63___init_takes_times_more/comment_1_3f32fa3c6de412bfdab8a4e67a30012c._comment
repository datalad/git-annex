Notice that it says "scanning for annexed files", not "unlocked files"
anymore.

The reason it's slower is explained by [[!commit 428c91606b]].
And that was necessary to fix the bad, longstanding bug
[[bugs/indeterminite_preferred_content_state_for_duplicated_file]].
It has to scan every annexed file, not only the unlocked ones,
in order to collect the data to not have that bug.

And the scan got optimised as well as possible, I think, at the time,
see the old issue you filed @yoh,
