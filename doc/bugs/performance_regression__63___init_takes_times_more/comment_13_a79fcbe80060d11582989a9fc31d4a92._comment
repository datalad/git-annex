An idea from looking at the flame graphs, is that if
reconcileStaged knew it was run on an empty keys db (or was doing a full
scan of the tree, not an incremental updte), it could avoid doing the
upsert, and do a blind insert instead.

This will need some care to be implemented safely... 

I benchmarked it, and using insertUnique is no faster, but using insert is.
This would be a 15% speed up.

Update: Implemented this optimisation.
