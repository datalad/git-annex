didn't have time yet to look at that :-/ as for \"where\"

- don't even know myself now how to lookup for those older github actions runs on github interface;

- they all are fetched to smaug within con/tinuous archive of build logs/artifacts. So for this PR:

```
(git)smaug:/mnt/datasets/datalad/ci/git-annex/builds/2022/07[master]
$> /usr/bin/find pr-128/build-ubuntu.yaml-7* -iname *deb
pr-128/build-ubuntu.yaml-761-ebf2f1b0-failed/git-annex-debianstandalone-packages_10.20220624+git120-gc3df38dd1_amd64/git-annex-standalone_10.20220624+git120-gc3df38dd1-1~ndall+1_amd64.deb

```
