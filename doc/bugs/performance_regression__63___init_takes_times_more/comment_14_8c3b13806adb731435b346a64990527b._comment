Implemented the two optimisations discussed above, and init in that
repository dropped from 24 seconds to 19 seconds, a 21% speedup.

I think that's as fast as reconcileStaged is likely to get without
some deep optimisation of the persistent library.

Then I realized that `git-annex init` does not really need to scan for
associated files. That can be done later, when running a command that needs
to access the keys database. Indeed, when git-annex is used in a clone of
an annexed repo without explicitly running `git-annex init`, that's what
it already did. I've implemented that, so now `git-annex init` takes 3
seconds or so. The price will be paid later, the first time running a
`git-annex add` or `git-annex unlock` or `git-annex get`.
