<https://github.com/yesodweb/persistent/issues/1441> got fixed in 
persistent-2.14.4.1. git-annex will get that speed improvement when it's
built with that version. I'd anticipate it improving from 19 seconds
to around 16 seconds.

(I further opened <https://github.com/yesodweb/persistent/issues/1457>
that would speed up some other parts of git-annex if implemented.)

---

The only reason to leave this bug open is that reconcileStaged is still
somehow slower than only the persistent-sqlite overhead can explain.
