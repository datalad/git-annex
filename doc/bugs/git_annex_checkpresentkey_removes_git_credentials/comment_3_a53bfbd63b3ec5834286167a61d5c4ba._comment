I can still reproduce this issue with 10.20250115, but in my testing it seems like it only happens against a forgejo-aneksajo instance on localhost without TLS, not against a different remote instance. This setup required `git config annex.security.allowed-ip-addresses 127.0.0.1`, maybe it has something to do with that or TLS...
