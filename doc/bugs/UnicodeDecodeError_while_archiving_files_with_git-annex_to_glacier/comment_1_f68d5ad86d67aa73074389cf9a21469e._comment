Doesn't seem likely that this is a bug in git-annex.
git-annex is clearly operating on the file just fine until it passes
it off to glacier-cli.

I suggest you pass --debug to git-annex, and see what glacier-cli command
it's running. That will probably be useful information for the glacier-cli
developers, to reproduce the problem without involving git-annex.

One possibility that comes to mind, given
<https://github.com/basak/glacier-cli/issues/16> is that your git-annex
repository might be in a path with some characters that glacier-cli doesn't
like in its name. If git-annex passes the full path to the file to
glacier-cli, it might then run into this problem. I'm not sure ATM if
git-annex does pass the full path to the file; it seems like a relative
path would avoid such a problem. The --debug output should answer this
too..
