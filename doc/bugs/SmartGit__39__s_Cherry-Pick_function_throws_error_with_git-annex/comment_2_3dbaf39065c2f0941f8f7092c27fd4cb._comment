> git-annex init sets up .git/hooks/pre-commit to run git annex pre-commit. It looks like when git commit is run, the git-annex program is not in PATH. This probably has something to do with the way you installed git-annex.

``which git-annex`` shows ``/usr/local/bin/git-annex``. I think I installed via Homebrew.

Seems to be a problem with SmartGit then. The pre-commit hooks work just fine in Terminal sessions.

Ah. Oops.
