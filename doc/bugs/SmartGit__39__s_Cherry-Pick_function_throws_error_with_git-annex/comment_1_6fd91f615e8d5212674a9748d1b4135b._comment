`git-annex init` sets up .git/hooks/pre-commit to run `git annex pre-commit`.
It looks like when git commit is run, the git-annex program is not in PATH.
This probably has something to do with the way you installed git-annex.

(Why is git-annex | less blanking out? Because git-annex outputs usage
messages to stderr, and less pages stdout. Use git-annex 2>&1 |less)
