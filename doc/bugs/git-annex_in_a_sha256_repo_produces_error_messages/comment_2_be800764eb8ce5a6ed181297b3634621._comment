The git command that git-annex is running that outputs this message, 
in the `git-annex get` case, is:

	git diff 4b825dc642cb6eb9a060e54bf8d69288fbee4904 335cd01e749bcfecc96b9d6d1f0bc3edb3ef2aec042da9a40379414a0f5d2243

Here 4b825dc642cb6eb9a060e54bf8d69288fbee4904 is the empty tree sha1, which is
hardcoded in git-annex as emptyTree. It must need  to instead use the
corresponding sha256
(6ef19b41225c5369f1c104d45d8d85efa9b057b53b14b4b9b939dd74decc5321) when diffing
against a sha256.

A related problem is that deleteSha is the all 0 sha1, and it turns out that
using that rather than the sha256 version, in a sha256 repository, fails at
least when `git update-index --index-info` does it. This is a bit surprising
given the comment in deleteSha that says git will accept the sha1 in that
situation. deleteSha is used in a couple of other places too, which will need to be checked.
