Fixed that.

It kind of seems like metadata could have an option to get the metadata for
a specific ref as well, but since it already has --branch which takes a
branch ref, adding a --ref which takes a file ref seems confusing. Maybe
--fileref? There are a decent number of other commands that also use
parseKeyOptions to support --branch/--key/--all that would also get the new
option if it were implemented.
