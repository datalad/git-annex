I ran into the same issue. My actual goal is to retrieve git-annex metadata for a specific file from a bare repo. I only know branch/commit and the path. `git-annex metadata` can only report for a tree or a key. For the former I need to implement path matching for a potentially voluminous output. For the latter I need to look up the key -- which currently is not supported for a bare repo.
