Hi,

### Please describe the problem.

I'm trying to set up a git-annex repo for my books/technical papers to have easy access to them on my desktop and laptop. I'm using a centralized server (following [this guide](https://git-annex.branchable.com/tips/centralized_git_repository_tutorial/on_your_own_server/)) to make it easy to sync between my machines.

The issue is however that sqlite crashes when I'm trying to get a file from my server. See the log further down for the error message. I'm suspecting it is due to the repo on my server is named `Böcker` (swedish name for books). It does work if I'm cloning it locally on my server. E.g.

[[!format sh """
$ ssh server
$ git clone /mnt/Valhalla/Böcker books
$ cd books
$ git annex init
init  ok
(recording state in git...)
$ git annex get facklitteratur/rapporter/143-rods.pdf
get facklitteratur/rapporter/143-rods.pdf (from origin...) 
ok                                
(recording state in git...)
"""]]

And if I use the `ssh://server/~/books` as a remote it works fine.

### What steps will reproduce the problem?
[[!format sh """
$ ssh server
server$ mkdir /tmp/Böcker
server$ cd /tmp/Böcker
server$ git init
server$ git annex init
server$ dd if=/dev/zeo of=foo bs=4k count=1
server$ git annex add foo
server$ git commit -m "Add foo"
server$ exit
$ git clone ssh://server/tmp/Böcker /tmp/Böcker
$ cd Böcker
$ git annex init
$ git annex get foo
"""]]
Note that `foo` need to have some size hence the use of `dd`, just doing `touch foo` did not trigger the issue for me.

### Please provide any additional information below.
Here is the error message I get without any changes to the config (I can silence the warning by enabling annex.sshcaching).

Note that this was run after I tested to create a repo with the name books.

### Have you had any luck using git-annex before? (Sometimes we get tired of reading bug reports all day and a lil' positive end note does wonders)

Sadly no, I manage to hit this on my first try of git-annex.  But I have known about git-annex for a few years, never found a good use for it in my workflow. As I've been using Syncthing for bigger files and that has been working ok.  But with that you pretty much get all or nothing and conflicts are no fun to resolve.  With my books I want to have my .bib file in git but somehow sync the files. I did not want to put everything in a normal git repo as the books directory takes about 64GB. After looking around I remembered git-annex and reading the walkthrough it seems to be a perfect fit! The killer feature in my opinion is that I can specify what files to sync. Which will be handy on my laptop as I don't really want to use up 64GB just so I can read one or two papers.

I'm not giving up on this that easily. Worst case I'll just rename my repo on my server to Books.

Thank you for all the hours developing this software!
