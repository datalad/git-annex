I don't think linux would change inode numbers while the filesystem was
mounted. But each mount of FAT gets new inode numbers, since FAT doesn't
actually have them and linux makes them up. So the filesystem being
unmounted and remounted for some reason in between the two steps of the
import would explain the behavior.

Note that I've opened 
[[todo/import_tree_from_FAT_does_unncessary_work_due_to_inode_instability]]
after thinking of some other consequences of this.
