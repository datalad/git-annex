### Please describe the problem.

When I start Git Annex then there are several warnings. The app renders my phone basically unusable (two time my phone rebooted and several time I had to remove the battery because the phone didn't respond).

It seems Git Annex uses all the available memory (one warning is that git-annex has text relocations and that this wastes memory.

I've attached a screen shot of the error messages.


### What steps will reproduce the problem?

Starting Git Annex on my phone


### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?

Git Annex: 5.20150927-gb506fb2
Android: 5.0.2


### Please provide any additional information below.

My phone is low-end (it has only ~512MB memory for example) - but normally everything works more or less okay.

If I use Chrome as the browser and start the webapp then Git Annex gets (it seems) killed quite often. It seems because there is not enough memory.

If I use a browser with a small memory footprint then the webapp works only barely better - very unresponsive (but at least Git Annex isn't killed).


### Have you had any luck using git-annex before? (Sometimes we get tired of reading bug reports all day and a lil' positive end note does wonders)

Sorry, no, I'm just starting out with Git Annex :)

But Git Annex looks amazing - exactly what I need! ;)

Can I somehow help to find the problem?

I'd really love to use Git Annex on my phone.
