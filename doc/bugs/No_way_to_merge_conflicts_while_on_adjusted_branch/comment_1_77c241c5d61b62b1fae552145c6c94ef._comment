git is what's doing the automatic merge, using the merge driver that you
configured. Is the file `study.org` an annexed file? If not, I don't really
see how this involves git-annex. git doesn't care if an adjusted branch is
checked out or not, when using a merge driver to merge a non-annexed file.

It looks like your merge driver is perhaps not working..
