Yes, this is a known problem with kqueue, it has to keep every directory in the tree open. On [[design/assistant/inotify]] I have a note that it may need to fork off extra watcher processes to deal with this. Of course that adds significant complication.

In the meantime, you may be able to increase your system's maximum allowed number of open files per process somehow.

(I doubt that the ssh-agent is related; git-annex does not use ssh-agent directly anyway..)
