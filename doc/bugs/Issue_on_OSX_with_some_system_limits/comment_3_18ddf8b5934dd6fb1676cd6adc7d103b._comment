Jimmy, sounds like I could use something like this to get the current limit:

    sysctl kern.maxfilesperproc

Probably prints \"sysctl kern.maxfilesperproc = 256\" or such.. can you verify?
Once I have the limit, I can make the kqueue code use subset of it, and print out a message when it needs to be increased, like the inotify code does.

(Also, the kqueue code only opens directories, not files, so unless you have 400000 directories, that's
a little high.)

---

On file removal not propigating, does this still happen? When you remove a file does a git commit automatically happen, or is that broken with kqueue?
