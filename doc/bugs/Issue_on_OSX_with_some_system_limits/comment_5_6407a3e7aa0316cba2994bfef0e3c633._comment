In relation to the system limits,

    laplace:~ jtang$ sysctl kern.maxfilesperproc
    kern.maxfilesperproc: 10240

Also, the maxfiles for the whole system is

    laplace:~ jtang$ sysctl kern.maxfiles
    kern.maxfiles: 12288

the above was the defaults as far as I recall. What you probably would be interested is the ulimits that the user see

    laplace:~ jtang$ ulimit -a
    core file size          (blocks, -c) 0
    data seg size           (kbytes, -d) unlimited
    file size               (blocks, -f) unlimited
    max locked memory       (kbytes, -l) unlimited
    max memory size         (kbytes, -m) unlimited
    open files                      (-n) 256
    pipe size            (512 bytes, -p) 1
    stack size              (kbytes, -s) 8192
    cpu time               (seconds, -t) unlimited
    max user processes              (-u) 709
    virtual memory          (kbytes, -v) unlimited

I would imagine the limit that you are looking for is 256. Hope this helps.

----

On the point about deletions not being propagated, it does do a commit. I suspect that the kqueue code is just not picking up the changes and pushing the changes out. The watch command on a single annex with no remotes functions as expected.
