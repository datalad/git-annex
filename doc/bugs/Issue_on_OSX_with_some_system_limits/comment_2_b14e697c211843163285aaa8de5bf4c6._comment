Doing,

    sudo sysctl -w kern.maxfilesperproc=400000

Somewhat works for me, git-annex watch at least starts up and takes a while to scan the directory, but it's not ideal. Also, creating files seems to work okay, when I remove a file the changes don't seem to get pushed across my other repos, running a sync on the remote repo fixes things.
