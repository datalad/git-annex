Each app has one subfolder inside /data that is private to that app (and user) alone. Generally, you can't read or enumerate /data itself. There is a function in the Java API to get the current app's internal storage folder, see https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/Context.html#getFilesDir%28%29.
