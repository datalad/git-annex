So basically I'd reply to it with `EXTENSIONS PROTOCOLVERSION2`, and then set a flag that supporting export is ok?
And `EXTENSIONS` always comes before `EXPORTSUPPORTED` ?
Sounds like a very ad-hoc use of the extension mechanism... I think it'd work but I'd feel bad if you made a release with such a feature and then it turned out it doesn't work...
Do you have some sort of per-releases?
