Hmm but a remote only learns that it's being used with exporttree=yes *after* it has sent a `VERSION`?

I'm afraid I can't bump the version in case of git-annex-remote-rclone, it's already widely used for non-exporttree scenarios and requiring a git-annex that supports `VERSION 2` for these existing usecases (which aren't affected by this bug) would be a regression...

I'll ask git-annex-remote-rclone maintainers, but it seems to me that defensive coding around the `EXPORT` command is gonna be a better solution in this remote's case.
