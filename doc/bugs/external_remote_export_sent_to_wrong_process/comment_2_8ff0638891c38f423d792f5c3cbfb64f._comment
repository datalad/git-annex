What about simply increasing the protocol version number? If VERSION 2 is
the same as VERSION 1, but only supported by the fixed git-annex, then an
external can just be updated to send VERSION 2, and it does not need to
worry about talking with a buggy version of git-annex.

git-annex could either continue to also support VERSION 1, or it could
refuse to work with externals that don't use VERSION 2. The latter would
force externals to get updated. But then those externals would have no way to work
with old git-annex even if they wanted to. I think forcing an update is not called
for.

Note that git-annex's handling of an external that sends VERSION 2 is not
stellar currently:

	joey@darkstar:~/tmp/b>git-annex initremote t type=external externaltype=test encryption=none 
	initremote t 
	  external special remote protocol error, unexpectedly received "CONFIG directory store data here" (command not allowed at this time)
	
	git-annex: unable to use special remote due to protocol error

	joey@darkstar:~/tmp/b>git-annex copy --to t
	
	  external special remote protocol error, unexpectedly received "UNSUPPORTED-REQUEST" (command not allowed at this time)

	  external special remote protocol error, unexpectedly received "UNSUPPORTED-REQUEST" (command not allowed at this time)
	copy x 
	  external special remote protocol error, unexpectedly received "UNSUPPORTED-REQUEST" (command not allowed at this time)
	(unable to use special remote due to protocol error) failed
	copy: 1 failed

Protocol debug shows what's happening:

	[2023-03-28 16:00:09.361602472] (Annex.ExternalAddonProcess) /home/joey/bin/git-annex-remote-test[3] --> VERSION 2

Not really ideal behavior for an old version of git-annex when used with
an external that wants to send VERSION 2 to ensure it does not need to deal with
this bug. But better than nothing I suppose.

(That output really ought to be fixed going forward, but old versions of git-annex
of course can't be fixed now.)
