You would not need to send back `EXTENSIONS PROTOCOLVERSION2`
yourself, only check if git-annex sends it. A better name might be 
EXPORTBUGFIXED, it's only using the existing extensions mechanism as a flag
to communicate that git-annex has the bug fixed.

Some old versions of git-annex don't send EXTENSIONS at all (and those
also don't have the bug fixed), but if git-annex does send it, it will
always be before EXPORTSUPPORTED.
