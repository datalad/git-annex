Thanks for the insight.

The `git stash` solution works assuming you are either:

 a. Going to keep it in your stash forever
 b. You are going to commit your stash eventually

I think there are situations where I want to completely abort a commit and not have to worry about it biting me down the road.

IMO from a end user perspective I think the best solution would be to have data only count as duplicate if it has a reachable file in your annex for options `--deduplicate`, `--clean-duplicates` and `--skip-duplicates` of `git annex import`.

What would be the downside to this?

Worst case scenario this re-wires up some symlinks to once dangling git objects. They still aren't duplicates, there will only be one symlink per formerly dangling git object. This seems better than data loss.

Thoughts?
