A simpler way to get to the same end result, without using git-annex
import:

	mv ~/foo .
	git annex add foo
	git reset --hard

Now "foo" is only present in the git-annex object store, and we don't
know what its filename(s) were.

So, it's not `git-annex import`, or `git-annex add`, or `git add`
that is dangerous here. It's `git reset --hard`.

git will happily lose lots of data until you commit it. Once it's
committed, it's safe. That's the rule of thumb. Nothing much that git-annex
can do about that.
