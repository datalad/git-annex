Have you actually verified that git-annex on freebsd, when compiled with
dbus support, is able to use it for anything? It expects to be speaking
to udisks2 to get notifications of things being mounted, and to
network-manager or wicd or systemd-networkd to get noticiations of
networking changes. I don't know if any of those are used on freebsd.

I have applied the --as-needed patch

In general, when sending patches, you really need to provide an explanation
of why the change is the right change to make..
