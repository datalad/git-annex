### Please describe the problem.
`git-annex sync gcryptremote` makes too many ssh connections one after another for each sub-task involved, potentially triggering firewall rate-limits on the SSH server.

### What steps will reproduce the problem?
sync with gcrypt remote while watching sshd logs on the server (I was getting >=5 connections per single sync in quick succession)

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?
Fedora 19, installed through cabal (without s3 and webapp support as the deps were failing to build)
