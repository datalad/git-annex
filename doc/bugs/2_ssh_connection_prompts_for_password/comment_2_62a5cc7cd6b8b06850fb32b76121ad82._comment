The improvements around ssh password prompting require ssh connection
caching to work. If a ssh connection fails because the wrong password is
entered or because there's no usable tty or whatever, there's no cached
ssh connection to reuse, so the next attempt to access that host will
result in another password prompt.

Also, datalad does not seem to be running git-annex with -J. So it *can't*
be trying to make two ssh connection at the same time. My recent work on
ssh password prompting was mostly to fix cases where git-annex is run with
-J.

It's also possible that some ssh configuration that I don't know of could
make ssh password prompt even when git-annex is running it with
`BatchMode=true` to avoid password prompts (in order to test if the ssh
connection is already up). That would then result in two ssh password
prompts, one after the other, which seems to match your transcript.

If you have only one remote, specifying `--from=origin` won't change
anything. Entering the right password would change something there though..
