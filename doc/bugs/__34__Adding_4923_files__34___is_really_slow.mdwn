Wow, what a great archiving system. Thank you for all your work on git annex!

### Please describe the problem.

I was using 'git annex assistant' on a brand-new annex that I created today. I had previously added about 20GB of data and a couple thousand files, mostly MP4 videos and MP3 music.

I then used regular 'mv' to add a folder containing about 20GB of music. This went well for a whileâ€”git annex assistant added two groups of files, containing roughly 700 and 1000 MP3s each. But the third group contained 4,923 files, and it's taking a really long time to import.

CPU usage is pretty consistently near 100%. According to the log, the files are being processed slowly.

### What steps will reproduce the problem?

I don't want to try to reproduce this problem until the MP3s finish being imported. I can try again later with thousands of digital photos if that would help.

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?

Version: 4.20130709.1 
Build flags: Assistant Webapp Pairing Testsuite S3 WebDAV Inotify DBus XMPP

Ubuntu 12.04.2 LTS

### Please provide any additional information below.

Here's the 'top' output and a snippet of the log. Let me know if you need anything else.
