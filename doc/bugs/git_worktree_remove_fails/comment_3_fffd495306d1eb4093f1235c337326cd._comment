Here's how to remove a worktree:

```bash
echo \"gitdir: $(readlink .git)\" > .git0;
rm .git;
mv .git0 .git;
git worktree remove .;
```

as done inside the worktree itself. Update paths if you want to remove the worktree from outside of it.
So long as you don't run another `git annex` command after replacing the symlink with a file, `worktree remove` should work!
