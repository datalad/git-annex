This is EINVAL from probably open(2) or something like that.

       EINVAL The  final  component ("basename") of pathname is invalid (e.g.,
              it contains characters not permitted by the underlying  filesys‚Äê
              tem).

The problem is likely the ending ".", since FAT and probably other Microsoft filesystems
don't allow that, and/or have other strange behavior like silently removing that.

Changed the code to avoid this.
