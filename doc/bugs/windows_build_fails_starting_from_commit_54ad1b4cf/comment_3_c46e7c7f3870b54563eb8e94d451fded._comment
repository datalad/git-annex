That's great news about the test suite in a deep directory. That was a
longstanding problem indeed and a good indication it's fully supporting
long filenames now.

I often mix up fromRawFilePath/toRawFilePath. Luckily the compiler will
notice. Should be fixed now.

As for converting the whole `watchDir` to RawFilePath, there is probably
not much benefit in doing that in such windows-specific code, but the goal
is to do such a conversion in as much of git-annex as possible, since it is
faster on unix to use RawFilePath end-to-end.

Doing it is as simple as juggling the use of fromRawFilePath/toRawFilePath
as the compiler allows, while converting code to use functions from
Utility.RawFilePath or System.FilePath.ByteString or that otherwise
use RawFilePath. I think you would be capable of that for sure!
