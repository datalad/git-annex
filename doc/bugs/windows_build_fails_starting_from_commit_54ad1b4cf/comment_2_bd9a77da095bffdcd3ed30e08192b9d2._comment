On a positive note I can confirm that my compiled versions of commits 54ad1b4cf and 398633c12
pass their test suite even in a subdirectory some 64 characters deep (for instance in a directory
named like `c:/Users/jkniiv/annx/annx.10.20230228-g505f1a654--test-test-test`) whereas the commit
just prior to \"Windows: Support long filenames in more (possibly all) of the code\" (54ad1b4cf), or
505f1a654, fails some one third to one half of its tests in said directory. Shortening the test
directory name to say `c:/Users/jkniiv/annx/annx` allows the test suite to pass in older versions
of git-annex all other things considered equal. So far I have been running the built-in tests
always in 'c:/annx' (/c/annx in Git Bash) but here on forward I'll probably start using a deeper
path somewhere in my user folder / home directory just to catch possible future regressions in long
path handling. In any case, @Joey, congratulations ðŸŽ‰ are in order for your fine achievement from
a Windows user point of view. :)
