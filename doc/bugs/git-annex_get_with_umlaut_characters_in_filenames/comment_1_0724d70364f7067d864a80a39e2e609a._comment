`git annex get` only acts on files that are present in the working tree of
the git repo, and which `git ls-files` lists. So, if git is somehow
confused about these filenames, which is appears to be, it makes sense that
git-annex wouldn't be operating on them.

I don't know why git would have such a problem with files with umlaut in
their names. AFAIK, git is quite agnostic about filename encodings.
However, your git status seems to be the smoking gun; the files are either
not known to git at all, or it thinks they were renamed. Does the git
log --stat show the files being deleted. Have you tried (re)adding the
files to git?
