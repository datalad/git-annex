### Please describe the problem.
There is no git-annex-shell command in path and thus sync with ssh server fails. If I symlink /usr/bin/git-annex-shell -> /usr/bin/git-annex, it complains that key is already present in annex and errors out. There is executable git-annex-shell in server's ~/.ssh/

### What steps will reproduce the problem?
Start webapp to sync local repo with ssh server.

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?
git-annex 4.20130627 on Gentoo

### Please provide any additional information below.
