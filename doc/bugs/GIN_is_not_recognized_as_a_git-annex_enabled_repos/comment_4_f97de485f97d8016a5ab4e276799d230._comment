Well, that is a different problem than the problem you reported, isn't it?
You seem to have shown that git-annex does in fact recognize your GIN
remote as a git-annex repo.

git-annex does not support uploading files to a git repo on GIN using http.

The datalad documentation says to add a remote using the ssh url of the GIN
repository, which git-annex can store files on. See 
<http://handbook.datalad.org/en/0.13_a/basics/101-139-gin.html#publishing-your-dataset-to-gin>

Without using datalad, the equivilant commands would be something like:

	git remote add gin git@gin.g-node.org:/ivis-mizuguchi/https.git
	git-annex copy --to gin

---

So this leaves the question of why git-annex tries to do a http request
when you ask it to copy the content to the http repo. That http request
failing is what results in the "(not found)" message.

Looks like that is due to `git-annex copy` checking to see if the content
exists on the remote. It does not. So it ought to try to send it,
which would fail with a better "copying to non-ssh repo not supported" error message.
However, intstead it displays the error.

I've fixed this bug, and now it fails with this message:

	copy test3.txt (to origin...) 
	  copying to non-ssh repo not supported
