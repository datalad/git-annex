Not sure this is quite the same situation, but on linux, I am seeing
`git-annex unlock` of a locked file display the warning.

Also, .git/annex/restage.log is left empty after the command completes.
Which seems to indicate it managed to restage the file after all. Is that
file empty for you on windows after it displays the warning and before
running other commands?
