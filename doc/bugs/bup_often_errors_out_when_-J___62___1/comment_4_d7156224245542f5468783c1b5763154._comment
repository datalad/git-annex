Got confirmation that bup is generally not concurrency safe.

I've made git-annex limit the number of bup-split it runs to 1.

It may be that this will also need to be done with bup-join, but I think
probably not since it probably does not write to the repo, and a bup-split
is unlikely to get in its way.
