Thank you!

That's sad to hear as it means bup will perform even worse where it wasn't performing well to begin with but unsafe is unsafe.

I'd consider this issue solved as bup performance problems are tracked in https://git-annex.branchable.com/bugs/Copying_many_files_to_bup_remotes_is_very_slow/ already.
