This seems most likely to be a concurrency issue in bup itself, or in how
it uses git.

However, I have not been able to reproduce it so far. I tried making 8
different files each 100 mb, and was able to copy them all to a bup repository
concurrently with no failures.

That was with bup 0.32. What is your bup version?

It would be good to know what error message bup outputs.
Unfortunately, since `bup split -q` is noisy on stderr, git-annex
sinks it to /dev/null and so you don't see it.

I've changed git-annex to display the stderr when `bup split` fails.
So if you can get an updated build of git-annex, and reproduce this problem,
we'll be able to see if this is a bug in bup, or what.
