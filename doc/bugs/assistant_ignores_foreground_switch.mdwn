### Please describe the problem.

git annex assistant ignores the --foreground switch:

```
florian@marduk ~ % /usr/bin/git-annex assistant --foreground --autostart        
git-annex autostart in /home/florian/.synced_configuration
ok
florian@marduk ~ % 
```

The assistant ist started, but forks to background. This also breaks the systemd unit from https://git-annex.branchable.com/tips/Systemd_unit/ (add Type=forking to the service works around that)

It seems to be connected to the autostart option, without --autostart it does not go background.

### What steps will reproduce the problem?


### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?

6.20170101-15 at Arch.

### Please provide any additional information below.

[[!format sh """
# If you can, paste a complete transcript of the problem occurring here.
# If the problem is with the git-annex assistant, paste in .git/annex/daemon.log


# End of transcript or log.
"""]]

### Have you had any luck using git-annex before? (Sometimes we get tired of reading bug reports all day and a lil' positive end note does wonders)
