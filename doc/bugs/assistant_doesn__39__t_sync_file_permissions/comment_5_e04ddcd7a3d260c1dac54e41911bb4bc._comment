@Pedro: What Joey is refering to is that git-annex uses sym-links behind the scenes to store even such a small file.  (BTW, that can be changed with the large-file config option, IIRC.)

@Joey: Even a \"full-fledged metadata storage for git\" wouldn't solve this problem since from git's POV it's still just a sym-link without permissions.
