Now that git-annex has a proper metadata system now, can this be handled?

Perhaps doing this:

git annex metadata -s __executable 001

could cause git-annex to set the executable bit (on get, fsck etc.) and that be set automatically on git annex add if the file has executable bit set (numbers are a bitmask for which execute bit to set..?).
