More generally, symbolic links cannot have permissions of their own, and git in fact indicates a file is a symlink by setting the tree object's mode to a specific magic number. So there is no git metadata that git-annex can use to track whether a file is supposed to be executable.

Therefore, this will only get fixed when there's some kind of full-fledged metadata storage for git.
