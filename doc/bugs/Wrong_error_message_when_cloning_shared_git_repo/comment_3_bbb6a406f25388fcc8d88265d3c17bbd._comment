Here is what I get while cloning:

	joey@darkstar:/tmp>git clone localhost:/tmp/manrepo xx
	Cloning into 'xx'...
	fatal: detected dubious ownership in repository at '/tmp/manrepo/.git'
	To add an exception for this directory, call:
	
		git config --global --add safe.directory /tmp/manrepo/.git
	fatal: Could not read from remote repository.
	
	Please make sure you have the correct access rights
	and the repository exists.

This is with git 2.45.2, and since current git prevents cloning a repository in
this situation, git-annex doesn't need to do anything.

I also tested what happens if the repository ownership allows cloning, but
after clonging and before git-annex init, the repository owner changes. In 
that case, with current git-annex, `git-annex-shell configlist` is able to
get the uuid from the remote repository despite the ownership snafu. Which is
ok.
