Hi, git-annex Team.

I want to ask you this issue.
GIN is not recognized as a git-annex enabled repository when using the HTTPS protocol.  
I cloned a GIN repository with HTTPS protocol and then did `git annex init` on the cloned local repository, but it is not recognized as a git annex-enabled remote.   
I checked the .git/config file and it says annex-ignore=true.

Because of this, git annex copy --to [GIN remote repository] is not possible with HTTPS protocol.  
Is git-annex capable of copying content over the HTTPS protocol?  
If there are any mistakes in my understanding please let me know.

sincerely yours,  
Rino Mizuguchi
