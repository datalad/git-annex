### Please describe the problem.

I can change the settings in one repo and sync it everywhere. Just to be surprised that one repo starts syncing to the transfer, every time it turns out that this repo lost its vicfg settings. Especially the Repository preferred contents are all back on standard. It was even once that it had the current settings and after the change and sync it goes back to some older state instead of the new one.

### What steps will reproduce the problem?

Well that is very hard. I have 8 repos and it happens randomly to some of them. I recreated all of them recently because I thought they are corrupt, that didn't help, just took me one week of time. It is also very hard to find a way to reproduce this because every vicfg causes a merge which takes minutes to hours.

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?
