### Please describe the problem.

Original case has more in [datalad github issue](https://github.com/datalad/datalad/issues/7371). 
In a nutshell in my words: a user has a repository which is v9, under ACL (but git annex works fine as is). A user clones from another user locally. `git annex init` fails to determine (doesn't record) UUID of the `origin` remote but also does not make it `git-annex` ignore.  If we manually set `origin` uuid within .git/config of the clone, then `git annex whereis` reports presence fine. But if we do `git annex get` (see [here](https://github.com/datalad/datalad/issues/7371#issuecomment-1546158732)), it says that it is unable to access remote origin, and suggests two other remotes (not available).

The sad part is that `git-annex` did not really give any reason ( in --debug) on why it didn't discover UUID or why it is unable to access it, e.g. here is output from `git annex init` in the clone when I think it should have discovered/recorded UUID

```

ok

from [this comment](https://github.com/datalad/datalad/issues/7371#issuecomment-1545929998).


So what we really need is some debug logging to tell us more.

### What steps will reproduce the problem?

we failed to create  a reproducer. So it is something about that user + original location.

`git annex upgrade` from v9 to v10 somehow resolved it in one sample case. We have more cases like that we are not upgrading yet to reproduce again.


### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?

originally in some older 8.2022  but now in 10.20230407
