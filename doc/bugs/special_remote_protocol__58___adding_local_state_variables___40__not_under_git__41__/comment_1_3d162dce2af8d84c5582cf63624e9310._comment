A reasonable use case indeed.

My initial feeling is, this can be handled well by storing the data
yourself in the filesysystem. You only need to pick a place for your
special remote to store the data. Presumably somewhere under `.git`
or under `.git/annex`. (The protocol's GETGITDIR can be used to
get the path to `.git`.)

And you need to pick a filename that won't be used by something else.

You can use the protocol's GETUUID to get the uuid of special remote,
and using that in the path to the data pretty well guarantees nothing
else is going to use that filename.
