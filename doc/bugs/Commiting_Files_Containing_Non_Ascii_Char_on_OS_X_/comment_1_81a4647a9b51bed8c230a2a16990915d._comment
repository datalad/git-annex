I think you are going to need to provide more information:

* Some actual file names that have the problem. \"non-ascii chars\" is a very wide description, you don't even say if you're using unicode or what.
* Some error messages or transcripts of what happens when you see the problem.
* What is your locale setting on OSX.

I tried with some unicode filenames on OSX and they were committed without difficulty in the en_US.utf8 locale.
