I tried with that filename, and had no difficulty committing it.

<pre>
oberon:repo joeyh$ git annex add George\'s\ Cafe\314\201 
add George's Caf√© ok
(Recording state in git...)
oberon:repo joeyh$ git commit -m foo
[master (root-commit) 8acd5d4] foo
 Committer: Joey Hess <joeyh@oberon.local.tam-lin.net>

I even tried running the assistant with all locale settings set to C, and it still had no problem adding and committing that filename.

So, I need help reproducing this, or I need to see the error message you see when the problem happens to you.
