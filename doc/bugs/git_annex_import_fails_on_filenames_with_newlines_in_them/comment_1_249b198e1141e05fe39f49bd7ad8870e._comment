Congrats on being the guy with newlines in his filenames.. someone had to do it!

Similarly, `git annex add` on the file will fail with the same error and leave it where it is and not added.

The problem here is that while git-annex is careful to use git commands with -z, so it gets \"foo\nbar\" with a literal newline from git ls-files, `git cat-file --batch` speaks a line-based protocol. And, it parses filenames like `git ref-parse` does -- and AFAICS, that does not provide a way to input something like \"foo\\nbar\" with an escaped newline. Normally this doesn't matter, since the whole line of input is taken to be a filename, so there's no need to escape anything, but of course it fails with newlines.

IMHO, the solution to this is to make `git cat-file --batch` have a -z option that enables NUL-delimited input (and probably output). If you want to see this happen, take it to the git developers..

(Should git annex import put files back if it fails to add them rather than leaving them sitting in the work tree?)
