### Please describe the problem.

If I addurl file pointing to file:///C:/... it seems to work just fine, but then refuses to drop it stating that can't verify its presence.

Please see two screenshots (sorry for not cut/paste here since it was already was painful -- debugging under Virtualbox in remote vnc through debconf internet which for some reason drops for me quite often):

as screenshot shows, apparently wget is clueless about file:// targets on windows (while curl does fine) -- may be related ;-)

### What steps will reproduce the problem?

addurl some file:///C:/ under windows pointing to existing file, and then try to drop that annexed file

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?

windows
20150805 or so

### Please provide any additional information below.
