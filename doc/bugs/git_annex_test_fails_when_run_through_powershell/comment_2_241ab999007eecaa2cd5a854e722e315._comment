The import problem can be reproduced by running git annex import on a different
drive in Windows. No powershell needed; it does fall back to the external
mv command, but that fails for some reason. Was unable to determine why
(running the same mv at the command line works ok). Fixed for Windows by
avoiding using the external mv command there.

Still need more details about the addurl failure. AFAICS, it does not
involve "mv" at all. Probably it involves
the generated file:// url not working for some reason. 
What drive and path did you run the test suite in?
