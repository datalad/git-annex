### Please describe the problem.

Well, I remember whining before on this issue.  It does cause some notable inconvenience when trying to automate use of annex -- I am left without a choice but try to reget files multiple times without knowing what was actual cause for it to fail to start with.  Originally I observed it while content had to be wget'ed, to which I thought "oh well -- might be some connection overload etc".  But now I have tried on a repository which is local to that drive -- there must be no problem accessing multiple files at once whatsoever.  But on a trial X with -J5 I have error: 613, ok: 255, on next call  error: 415,  ok: 198 and so on -- kinda converging but imho it must not be so difficult.  I do suspect some race condition in annex itself preventing correct operation.

### What steps will reproduce the problem?

git annex get -J10   on some well sized annex.  Possibly with original annex to fetch content from just right on the same drive

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?

6.20170408+gitg804f06baa-1~ndall+1
