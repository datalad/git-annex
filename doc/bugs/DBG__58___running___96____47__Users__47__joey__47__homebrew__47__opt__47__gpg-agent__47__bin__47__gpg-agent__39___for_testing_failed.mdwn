on my repo

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?

### Please provide any additional information below.
I am using a different WIFI I haven't used before. Maybe it is blocking something…

### Have you had any luck using git-annex before? (Sometimes we get tired of reading bug reports all day and a lil' positive end note does wonders)
Yes.
