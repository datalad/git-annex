I have not had any luck with reproducing the problem, using
your script, on Debian unstable. The transfer repo gets
the file contents and both it and the source repo knows where they are.

Do you see the same behavior if, rather than running the assistant
for 30 seconds, you run `git annex sync --content` ?

Are you using git-annex in direct mode and/or on an unusual filesystem?
