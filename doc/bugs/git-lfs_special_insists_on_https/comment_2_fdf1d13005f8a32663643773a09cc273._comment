Sorry to comment on a done bug. It's just that it seems opening a forum thread is going to lose the context.

Can I ask, why is a git url even required? Isn't that going to require that only a self-hosted git is available anyway... because you aren't going to get the specific configuration to allow git-annex to fetch .git/config for the annex id?

I thought the git-lfs remote was only for \"blob\" storage, and so API only. Or at least, it being integrated with a git service would have been optional, not mandatory.

The example I gave with http and non-standard port was based on running the reference implementation https://github.com/git-lfs/lfs-test-server alone. Which works when a git project is configured just local (no remotes) and then the lfs url is set.
