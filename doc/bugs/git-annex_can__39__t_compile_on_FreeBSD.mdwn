### Have you had any luck using git-annex before? (Sometimes we get tired of reading bug reports all day and a lil' positive end note does wonders)

No, I'm afraid.  But it looks really good!  I'm trying to use it to add a bunch of high-res images to my Jeykll website, all managed through Git, with the images stored in S3.
