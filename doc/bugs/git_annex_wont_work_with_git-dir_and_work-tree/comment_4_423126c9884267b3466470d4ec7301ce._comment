The \"scripty stuff\" may be a simple find or grep on the annexed dir, that doesn't actually involve git-annex, but those simple and usual commands are fooled by the content of .git, because of that it would be nice to have git-annex-{assistant, webapp, ...} work in this setup, it is not only a matter of scripts, other applications may have unexpected behavior in presence of .git -_-

To make the usage of other apps more complicated doesn't seems an objective of git-annex-webapp, am I wrong?
