Tried in chromium, also seeing it block sometimes, though not always, on
page loads.

This seems rather similar to this old bug involving the same software:
<https://github.com/yesodweb/wai/issues/146>
But not I think quite the same, because that was caused by
a long delay between clicks, and this happens when clicking immediately.

The browser's network console shows a few ms for all resources to load,
except the page itself which for some reason takes a log time.

tcpdump shows that chromium does not send a request for that page until
many seconds after the click. The response to the request is immediate.

Before that point there is only some SYN/ACK traffic. Which looked a bit
weird maybe.
