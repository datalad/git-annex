Just tested more:
- Brave - slow
- Chrome - slow
- Firefox - works like a dream

It seems it's something wrong with Chromium-family browser support. There are no JavaScript and network errors in developer console.
I also tried to start git annex webapp with --vebose and --debug flags - nothing there as well.
