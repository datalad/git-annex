This was broken in [[!commit 0d2e3058ee01d55dc3b929ddf8e0573a95a2ca85]]
which was included in version 10.20220822.

I've reverted the commit as a first step. This means repos initialized
at v9 will never autoupgrade to v10, which will need to be fixed
somehow.

Gonna need to make a git-annex release ASAP to get this fix out there.
