### Please describe the problem.

After adding a new SSH remote with the assistant on Windows, git-annex can't connect the remote.

### What steps will reproduce the problem?

1. On Windows, add a new "Remote server" repository in the webapp.
2. Use password authentication. The pairing will succeed initially but it will be added as a "metadata only" remote because SSH connections using the new key pair fail.

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?

git-annex 10.20221213-gac824ff96

Installed with the scoop package on Windows.

### Please provide any additional information below.

The problem seems to be that the private key is written with CRLF line endings. I can manually SSH to the remote (using git-annex's key) with the system-installed `ssh`, but Git for Windows rejects the key as invalid until it's converted to LF line endings.

### Have you had any luck using git-annex before? (Sometimes we get tired of reading bug reports all day and a lil' positive end note does wonders)

Yes! I've been using git-annex from the command line to manage my music library for years. Now I'm in the middle of replacing my Syncthing usage with git-annex assistant.
