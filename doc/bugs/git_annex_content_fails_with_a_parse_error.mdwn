### Please describe the problem.

I tried to use git annex content, but that failed with a parse error.


### What steps will reproduce the problem?

Type this anywhere: 

git annex --debug content . "exclude(foo.ml)"
content . git-annex: Parse error: Parse failure: near "foo.ml"

It fails with the example of the man page:
   git annex content . "include(*.mp3) or include(*.ogg)"

However, it works when trying: git annex content . "include()".

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?

git-annex version: 4.20130709.1, ubuntu quantal

### Please provide any additional information below.

[[!format sh """
# If you can, paste a complete transcript of the problem occurring here.
# If the problem is with the git-annex assistant, paste in .git/annex/daemon.log


# End of transcript or log.
