Notice that nooone has ever complained about encountering this problem.
Not many users are affected. So, a change that prevents the problem
occuring going forward, without fixing old repositories, is not going to
bother many users.

* Make `preSanitizeKeyName` escape out spaces, so new WORM keys
  won't have spaces.
* Let WORM keys with spaces be able to be migrated to not have spaces,
  using `git annex migrate`
* Make the Remotes.External refuse to have anything to do with keys
  with spaces, and suggest that the user migrate them.
