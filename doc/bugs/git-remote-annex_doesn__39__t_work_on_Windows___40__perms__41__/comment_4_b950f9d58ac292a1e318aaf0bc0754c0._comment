Seems to be the same problem as
<https://git-annex.branchable.com/bugs/Fails_to_drop_key_on_windows___40__Access_denied__41__/>
which also involves directory special remote, but does not involve
git-remote-annex.

A comment there tried what I suggested here, and indeed removing the
ReadOnly attribute from the file in the directory special remote avoids the
problem.
