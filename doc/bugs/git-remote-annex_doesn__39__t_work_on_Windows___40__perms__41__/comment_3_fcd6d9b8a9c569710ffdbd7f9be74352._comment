Only way I can see thawing removing write perms if is you have
core.sharedrepository configured to a particular umask value.

But it certainly is possible that some other part of git-annex removes
write perms.

And in particular the directory special remote does, when content is stored
in it. And you're using that.

So, new theory: The GITBUNDLE object is stored on the directory special
remote. When it later gets pulled from it, the file has readonly attribute
set.

Can you check if the directory special remote contains files with the
readonly attribute set, and see if clearing that attribute prevents the
problem from happening?
