AFAIK, git-remote-annex is not installed on windows. I assume you set up
the link to git-annex yourself.

This is a puzzling problem to me. I don't know anything about windows
readonly attributes. But I don't think git-annex would ever set them.

Indeed, it never freezes content on windows at all. That can be seen
in the debug output you posted, where it does say it's "thawing content",
but never "freezing content".

If you had somehow configured a freeze hook that set the readonly
attribute, it would run it on windows. I suppose you would have thought to
mention if that was the case though.

Also rather puzzling is that this is a temp object file, and not a
.git/annex/objects/ file. So the failure is apparently happening in the
middle of downloading the GITBUNDLE object, before it gets moved to that
location. But the same code is run at that point as by any download of any
git-annex object.
