git-annex has detected problems with the filesystem, since symlinks
work I think it detected that the filesystem allows writing to a
file even when the file's write bit is not set.

In that situation, a git-annex repository using symlinks will apprear to
work, but if you have an annexed file "foo" in there, and run "echo hi >
foo", it will follow the symlink, and overwrite the annexed file, ignoring
the lack of write bit. This can result in data loss in an unexpected way,
which is why git-annex avoids using the symlinks in this situation.

I've added an additional message to make more clear what is happening.
