You did not seem to paste the whole log, but it's clear that your git repository is corrupt. You might try running `git annex repair` inside it.

This was probably caused by a disk corruption or if you're lucky just a hard shutdown that caused files to get truncated.

The assistant tries to detect corrupt repositories on startup, but it's hard to detect when a repository has a few corrupt objects like this. This is why the webapp suggests you set up periodic repository consistency checks, which should eventually repair this kind of problem.

Perhaps it would make sense for the webapp, when a thread crashes, to provide a button to run an consistency check immediately.
