You can't accomplish this with `remote.<name>.annex-ssh-options`,
since it is not exposed to the shell, and the parser just breaks it up into
words.

A smarter parser would be needed. Or you could configure it in
~/.ssh/config, or perhaps make a ssh config file elsewhere and use
annex-ssh-options to pass -F to ssh to make it use this other config file.

Now that git-annex supports `GIT_SSH_COMMAND`, which is exposed to the
shell, you should be able to accomplish it that way. I don't know if that
would work in your use case, since the environment variable affects all ssh
remotes, not just one.
