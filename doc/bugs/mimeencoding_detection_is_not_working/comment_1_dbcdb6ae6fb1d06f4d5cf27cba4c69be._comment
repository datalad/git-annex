Is your git-annex built with support for mime type 
detection? Post the output of `git-annex version`

I don't think it's possible that a filename can affect this.
I'd only believe that if you showed me the same content in a file without a
cryllic filename being treated differently.

Also, when I try feeding all the data into `git-annex matchexpression`,
it behaves as expected:

	joey@darkstar:~/lib/tmp> if git-annex matchexpression --file=привет.jpg --size=100 --mimeencoding=binary --largefiles 'mimeencoding=binary and largerthan=0'; then echo match; fi
	match

You could try the same command to see if your git-annex behaves differently.
