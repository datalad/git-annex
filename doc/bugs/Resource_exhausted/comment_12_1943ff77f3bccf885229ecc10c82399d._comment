This is happening to me now about twice per day.  I've got a repo that is completely synced already and I'm working on a project in IntelliJ.  When I check git-annex I often see this message when it is doing a startup scan or consistency check.

The message can be seen here: http://imgur.com/Xb4LA73

Are there logs somewhere that I can gather and supply to you to help track this down?  I'm using the 2014-01-07 release of git-annex for Mac OS.
