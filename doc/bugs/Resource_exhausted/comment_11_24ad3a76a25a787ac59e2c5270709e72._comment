I now understand the problem described in comment 6, where once it started failing, it would leak one file descriptor per failure.

I think that failure mode was fixed by accident in the changes in [[!commit 2fd63f3cfac705f0a18f4bcbe0489ce8ea1800d7]].

This doesn't explain what would open so many files to get it into that failure mode, however.
