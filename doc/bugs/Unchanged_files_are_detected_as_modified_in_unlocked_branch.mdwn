### Please describe the problem.

I have a git-annex repo with lots of images and keep a unlocked v6 branch around to access them. When new files are added (i.e. after running `git annex sync --content`), they are often detected as "modified":

    $ git annex status .
    M image.jpg

They are however identical to the checked-in files:

    $ cp image.jpg image-changed.jpg
    $ git checkout -- image.jpg
    $ cmp image.jpg image-changed.jpg && echo "No change"
    No change

This seems to happen to older files from time to time as well, but I cannot reproduce that.

The only way to rectify this I can find is `git checkout` - but that means I have no way to know whether I am actually throwing away changes. It also has the unfortunate side effect of changing the mtime, leading to previews having to be regenerated.

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?

git-annex version: 6.20171026-gd451d333d (standalone binary) on Debian stretch.
