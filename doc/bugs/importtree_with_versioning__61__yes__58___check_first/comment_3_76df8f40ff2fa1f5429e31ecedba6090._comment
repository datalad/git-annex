Wait though... We have signature=anonymous. So git-annex does in fact know
that this special remote is read-only. git-annex will never try to write to
it (even if the bucket somehow allowed anonymous writes) as long as it's
configured with signature=anonymous.

So, it could just avoid trying to set versioning when signature=anonymous,
and assume the bucket has versioning enabled.

Hmm, in lockContentS3, when versioning is enabled, it calls
checkVersioning, which checks if a S3 version ID has been recorded for the
file. What if the bucket did not actually have versioning enabled? Then an
import from it would not record a S3 version ID. That would make this, and
other places like checkKey that expect versioned buckets to have S3 version
IDs fail in unexpected ways.

So, I guess I'm inclined to not go down this read-only path, and instead wait for
aws to get updated and use that.
