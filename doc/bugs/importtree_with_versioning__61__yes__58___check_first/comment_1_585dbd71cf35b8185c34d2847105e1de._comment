Unfortunately <https://hackage.haskell.org/package/aws> does not implement
the versioning check, so it will need to be added there. And it tends to take
some time for new versions of the build dependency to reach everywhere.

<https://github.com/aristidb/aws/issues/290>

I do think that is the only safe way to go though. I considered making
git-annex assume that a bucket where versioning cannot be set is read-only.
If git-annex is really never going to write to a bucket, it's safe to
assume versioning is enabled. But, unfortunately, ACLs can sometimes
prevent changing configs like versioning, but still allow other write
operations. Also, a S3 remote might be initialized without permission to
write to an existing bucket, but later S3 creds be used that do allow
writing.
