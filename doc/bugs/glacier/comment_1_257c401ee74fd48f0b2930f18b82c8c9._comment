That looks rather more like a bug in glacier-cli than a bug in git-annex to
me.

"expected a bytes-like object, str found" has a ton of google hits, 
and looks to be breakage related to python 3's changes to string handling.

Please file a bug on glacier-cli, and consider making it use python 2 until
it can be fixed. I'll bet python 2 will avoid this problem.
