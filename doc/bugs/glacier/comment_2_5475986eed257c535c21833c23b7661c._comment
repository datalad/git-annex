IIRC, at the time I wrote glacier-cli, boto (the Python AWS library it uses) had no Python 3 support, so I targeted Python 2 only. I see that boto supports Python 3 now. Patches to glacier-cli for Python 3 support welcome.

Your Python 2 error looks like https://bugs.python.org/issue11898 to me. I know that others have hit the same error in the past. It's a problem between boto and httplib and Python, not a bug in glacier-cli. I don't think it affects Debian or Ubuntu, so you may need to take it up with Arch developers (perhaps Debian or Ubuntu carries a patch?)
