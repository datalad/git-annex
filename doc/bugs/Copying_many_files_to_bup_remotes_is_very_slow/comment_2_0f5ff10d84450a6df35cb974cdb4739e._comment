Agreed.

I see two potential ways to improve performance:

* Batching:
  Bup can split multiple files at once. If it's given 10, 20, 100 files at a time, the per-split overhead matters less. Batching is something git-annex might need to learn sooner or later anyways because file transfer generally doesn't scale well currently (bup's slowness just exacerbates the problem).
* Bup index+save:
  Use the same pattern as Borg. Back up the whole git-annex repo at a time and selectively restore in order to `get`. Not sure this would be a great idea but it should improve performance in my use-case (copy everything).
