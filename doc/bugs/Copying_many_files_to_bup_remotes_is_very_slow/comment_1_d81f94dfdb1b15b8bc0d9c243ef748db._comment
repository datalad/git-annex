I don't think that git-annex is doing anything particularly slow with the
bup special remote. Other than actually running bup, that special remote
should run about as fast as other similar special remotes, like say
the directory special remote.

So, this is probably a performance problem in bup. Now, git-annex does
use bup in an unusual way, running one bup-split per file to store in it.
That was the only way to shoehorn what git-annex needs to do into bup
though.
