Indeed it does. I assumed it'd concatenate the files internally for efficiency but is still able to output them separately later but that is not the case. I guess you could store the offsets externally and skip/seek but that'd be inefficient. 
Perhaps bup could add an option for batching multiple singular-file splits in one invocation to avoid overhead.

Alternatively, git-annex could index+save using excludes. That could be quite complicated (especially tracking which object exists inside which batches) but it could work.
