Little bit of a scary change, because calls to adjustTree could be not
handling the case of a submodule correctly in their adjusttreeitem
function.

So I checked them all..

Command.Export uses adjustTree with an adjusttreeitem
function that runs catKey on the sha from the TreeItem.
I think that would be ok, because catKey will see it's not 
a key, and in that case it passes back the TreeItem unchanged.

Each different adjusted branch has its
own function. Most of those check if the TreeItem
is a symlink, with a submodule is not, and they'll return
it unchanged.

The PresenceAdjustment instead
uses catKey, and again looks ok, because it falls back to returning the
TreeItem unchanged.

The LockAdjustment, when the TreeItem is not a symlink, also uses catKey,
which will see it's not a key, and also falls back to returning the
TreeItem unchanged.


Think that's everything, so this seems a safe change to make.

But.. I don't actually understand how your change fixes the problem!

(Of course, I tried your patch, and it does work...)

I've been staring at it for 30 minutes and it seems to me that
the TreeItem you have it construct gets passed to adjusttreeitem,
which always returns it unchanged (per analysis above). Then you
deconstruct the TreeItem, extracting the file mode and sha, and
construct a TreeCommit from those. As far as I can see, that TreeCommit
must be identical to the one it constructed before this patch.

Hmm, so I added a debug print and it's not the same, the sha
is different. Even weirder, the sha in `commit` never get stored
in the git repo.

What am I missing?
