When `annex.dotfiles` is set to true, git-annex should treat dotfiles just like other files, so it should apply .gitattributes to them. With that in mind, I'd expect something like this to work:

```
.* annex.largefiles=nothing
.caltrash annex.largefiles=anything
.calnotes annex.largefiles=anything
```

I haven't tested it though.
