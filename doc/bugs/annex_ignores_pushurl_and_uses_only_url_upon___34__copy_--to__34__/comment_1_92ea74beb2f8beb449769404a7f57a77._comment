Thing is, pushUrl is documented in git-push as "The <pushurl> is used for
pushes only.". And while git-annex is sending data to the remote,
that's not really the same as a push.

Following that logic, if git has a pullUrl, then git-annex should
use that for `git annex get`, since that's similar to a pull.
But then there are other operations git-annex does to remotes
that are similar to neither a push or a pull. And if git doesn't have a
pullUrl, then `git annex get` probably shouldn't use pushUrl, because
perhaps git will later get a pullUrl.

That's why annexUrl was added in 2011. Which is just used for all annex
operations.

So, I suggest you just set annexUrl at the same time you set pushUrl, 
and be happy. ;)
