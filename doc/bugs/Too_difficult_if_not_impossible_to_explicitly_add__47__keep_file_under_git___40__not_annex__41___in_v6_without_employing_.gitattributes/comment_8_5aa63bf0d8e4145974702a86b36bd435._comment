I don't know what you mean with `git annex init` in a v6 repo somehow
doing something to a non-annexed file. That would be extemely surprising
if it happened, and it does not happen when I try to follow your
instructions.

	joey@darkstar:~/tmp/v62>git annex init --version=6
	init  (merging origin/git-annex into git-annex...)
	(recording state in git...)
	ok
	(recording state in git...)
	joey@darkstar:~/tmp/v62>ls
	x  y@
	joey@darkstar:~/tmp/v62>git annex get y
	get y (from origin...) (checksum...) ok
	(recording state in git...)
	joey@darkstar:~/tmp/v62>git status
	On branch master
	Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.
	nothing to commit, working tree clean
