The several comments after my analysis above seem to still be under the
impression that it's somehow hard to keep files stored in git, not annexed
in v6 mode. But as my analysis shows, that is not what is happening at all
in the test case given.

If you have a situation there that problem occurs, please share it.
Otherwise, I will close this bug report.
