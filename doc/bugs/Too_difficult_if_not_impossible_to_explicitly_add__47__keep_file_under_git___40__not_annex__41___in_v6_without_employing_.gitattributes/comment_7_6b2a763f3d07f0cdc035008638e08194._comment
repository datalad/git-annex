You are right, if we stage that file again with annex.largefiles option, it stays in git.
But still keeping a file in git is troublesome. For example: Take a repository with an annexed file and a file in git, clone it and the call git annex init --version=6 on the clone.
This will lead to a dirty repository, where git status as well as git annex status are stating, that the file in git has unstaged modifications.
I'm not sure, whether this is actually related but I guess it is. Causing fresh clones to be dirty is at least a strange consequence for having files directly in git.
