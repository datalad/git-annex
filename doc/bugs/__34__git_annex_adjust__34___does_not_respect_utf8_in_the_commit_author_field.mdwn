### Please describe the problem.

### What steps will reproduce the problem?

I ran `git annex adjust --unlock` in a repo. `git-annex` did its job and added a commit with the description "git-annex adjusted branch". The author field does not seem to respect utf8, though. I get: "Author:     FÃ©lix <felix@example.com>" while I have "Author:     Félix <felix@example.com>" for all the other (manual) commits.

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?

Current Debian sid version: 7.20181205
