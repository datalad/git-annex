OK, problem solved. I deleted the key on the server and then readded the repository. Now I have a separate git-annex key pair and the config is as you described. I don't know why an existing key pair was used in the setup before. I log into my home server frequently and don't remember that I added the public key manually (especially regarding the restriction to git-annex-shell that was applied).

However, thanks for the great work so far!
