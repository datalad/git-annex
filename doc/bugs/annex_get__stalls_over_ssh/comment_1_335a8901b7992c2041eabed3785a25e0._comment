Your git-annex-shell does support p2pstdio, not the older thing that
git-annex no longer uses. But it's from fairly early in
its rollout, and it does seem likely that it has a since-fixed bug.

There were at least 3 commits made soon after version 6.20180808
that fixed hangs in the p2p protocol:

[[!commit 0b053b96119c1a2d6c2d03ba7f98f032e89b8b66]]
[[!commit 983c9d5a53189f71797591692c0ed675f5bd1c16]]
[[!commit 6ecd55a9fa4c64399b5ede3944bd2aa5f78cf0b1]]

So I think it will likely be fixed by an upgrade.
