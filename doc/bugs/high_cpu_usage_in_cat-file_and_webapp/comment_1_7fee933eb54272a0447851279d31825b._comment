The most likely reason for the assistant to use CPU like this is when it's running
the expensive transfer scan to find files that need to be copied from/to
remotes. That has to consider every file in your repository's work
tree, and uses git cat-file to extract information from the git
repository to see where the file is currently located. This is normally
only done when the assistant starts up.

.git/annex/daemon.log will show when the expensive transfer scan starts and
finishes. Look for "starting scan" and "finished scan" lines. Or, open the
webapp and look to see what activities it says it's performing.
