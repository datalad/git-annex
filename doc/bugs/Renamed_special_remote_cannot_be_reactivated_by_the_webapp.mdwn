Setup:

* fresh install of Debian Wheezy with git-annex 4.20130227 pulled in from unstable
* clone existing repository and activate assistant
* repository has encrypted rsync remote originally setup with the name `metaarray`
* this remote was renamed to `ma` a long time ago, using the webapp
* had to perform this rename on each client

Steps:

* attempt to reactivate special remote using webapp repositories page, on reinstalled machine

Expected:

* special remote starts working
* renaming special remotes ought to survive clones

Actual:

* firstly, special remote activation page has blank hostname box and the hostname of the machine is in the username box
* form gives error "cannot change encryption type of existing remote"

Workaround:

* execute `git annex initremote metaarray`
* rename `metaarray` to `ma` again using the webapp

Perhaps the renaming of the remote not surviving clones is unavoidable, but the webapp should be able to cope with the situation.  Thanks.
