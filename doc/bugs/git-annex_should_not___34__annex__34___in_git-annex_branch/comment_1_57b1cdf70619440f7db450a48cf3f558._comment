Adding a large file to git just because the git-annex branch is currently
checked out seems like it would be a large footbomb. That is generally
harder to recover from than adding a file to the annex and then realizing
it needs to be added to git instead.

Since git generally allows switching branches with new files
staged. It would be entirely reasonable to check out the git-annex branch
after adding a new annexed file but before committing it.
And checking out the git-annex branch, `git-annex add` of a large file
without committing it, then switching back to the main branch and committing
there is also possible if someone wants to do that for some reason.

Since manual commits to the git-annex branch need extra steps anyway
(eg removing .git/annex/index or committing using it instead of the usual
index file), I don't see much point in refining it.
