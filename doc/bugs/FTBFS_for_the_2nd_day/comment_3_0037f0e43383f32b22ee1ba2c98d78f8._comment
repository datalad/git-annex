You're welcome, Yarik! I try to do my part for git-annex although for medical reasons my personal
bandwidth is a bit limited (for instance, I don't pretend to grok Haskell much at all except at
a general functional programming level and I have even trouble with some of the intricacies of git, too).
However, I felt your last sentence was a small hint/suggestion, so with a small leap of faith I made my first
contribution to an outside project in the form of a pull request to datalad/git-annex,
[here](https://github.com/datalad/git-annex/pull/134) . :)
