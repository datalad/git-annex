I'm inclined to agree with you, it's probably a problem with
<https://hackage.haskell.org/package/disk-free-space>

I am not going to be able to reproduce this!

Could you take a look at disk-free-space in ghci and see if it reproduces
there?

	ghci> import System.DiskSpace
	ghci> getAvailSpace "/"
	283744563200
	ghci> getDiskUsage "/"
	DiskUsage {diskTotal = 501386043392, diskFree = 283761369088, diskAvail = 283744591872, blockSize = 4096}

Looking at the code, it assumes bsize and frsize are CULong. I guess it's
that or FsBlkCnt is somehow wrong.
