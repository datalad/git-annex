### Please describe the problem.

Just tried to install git-annex on a friend's Windows machine to share a repo, but a lot of the tests failed. I have no idea how to debug things on Windows, maybe someone has an idea. AFAIK Windows has only crippled file systems, I tried with NTFS and ReFS.

It says "Permission denied. File is being used by another process". Maybe some kind of indexing? git annex assistant was turned off and it was the only test running.

### What steps will reproduce the problem?

Install git, install git-annex, run "git annex test"

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?

Windows 10. git 32 bit

Of course! On Linux, it runs perfectly. I manage all my data with git-annex.
