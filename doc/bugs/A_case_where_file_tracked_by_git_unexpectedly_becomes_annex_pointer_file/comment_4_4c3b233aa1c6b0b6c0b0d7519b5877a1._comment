It's almost possible to get the same unwanted conversion without any git
races:

	echo content-git > file-git
	sleep 2
	git add file-git
	git commit -m add

	echo foo > file-git
	echo content-annex > file-annex
	git -c annex.largefiles=anything annex add file-annex

In this case, git currently does not run the modified file-git through the
clean filter in the last line, so the annex.largefiles=anything doesn't
affect it.

But, as far as I can see, there's nothing preventing a future version
of git from deciding it does want to run file-git through the clean filter
in this case.

I am not going to try to prevent against such a thing happening.
As far as I can see, anything that the clean filter can possibly do to
avoid such a situation will cripple existing uses cases of
annex.largefiles, like largerthan() as mentioned above.
The user has told git-annex to annex "anything", and if git
decides to run the clean filter while that is in effect, caveat emptor.

Which is not to say I'm not going to fix the specific case this bug was
filed about. I actually have a fix developed now. But just to say that
setting annex.largefiles=anything/nothing temporarily is a blunt instrument,
and you risk accidental conversion when using it, and so it would be a good
idea to not do that.

One idea: Make `git-annex add --annex` and `git-annex add --git`
add a specific file to annex or git, bypassing annex.largefiles and all
other configuration and state. This could also be used to easily switch
a file from one storage to the other. I'd hope the existence of that
would prevent one-off setting of annex.largefiles=anything/nothing.
