I think that a previous, failed import from the remote, run in a
different clone of the repository than the import that later fails,
could have caused the problem.

My thinking is, while import is downloading files, the content identifiers
get recorded in the git-annex branch. Only once the import is complete does
the imported tree get grafted into the git-annex branch. So, if the import
fails (or is interrupted), this can leave content identifiers in the log. 
The git blobs for small files have already been stored in git, but no tree 
references them. If that git-annex branch gets pushed, then in a separate
clone of the repository, running the import again would see those content
identifiers. But the git blobs referenced by them would not have been pushed,
and so would not be available.

We already know that the import was failing due to the S3 permissions,
so the only other thing that would have been needed is for the git-annex
branch to be pushed to origin, and then this same import tried later in a
different clone.

@yarikoptic does this seem plausibly what could have happened?
