I was wrong, `git-annex forget` cannot cause this, since
[[!commit 8e7dc958d20861a91562918e24e071f70d34cf5b]] in 8.20210428
made exported tree grafts be preserved through a forget.

This leaves me with no scenario that might cause this problem. Unless
a git-annex version older than that were used.

I've reverted [[!commit 69e6c4d024dcff7c2f8ea1a2ed3b483a86b2cc7d]] which I
had made to guard against the `git-annex forget` scenario, since it would
slow down imports of trees that contain a lot of small files.

It still seems possible that commit would have avoided the problem, but
until I understand what actually caused the problem, I don't want to
unncessarily slow git-annex down with an unverified fix for it.
