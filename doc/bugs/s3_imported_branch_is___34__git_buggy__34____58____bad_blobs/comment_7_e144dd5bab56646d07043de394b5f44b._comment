One way I can see that this might happen is if `git-annex forget`
has been used, after a previous export/import.

In that case, the content identifier database would be populated with a
GIT key, which would be used instead of downloading the file to be
imported. Resulting in a git sha being used, which could not be present in
the git repository. Because while the git-annex branch usually gets
imported/exported trees linked into it, `git-annex forget` erases that.

So a possible scenario:

	git-annex export or import
	git-annex forget
	pushing git-annex branch to somewhere
	in a separate git clone, pulling that git-annex branch
	git-annex import

That is worth trying to replicate. But it seems pretty unlikely to me that
is what you actually did ...?

Leaving aside the possibility that `git hash-object` might be buggy and not
record the object in the git repository, that's the only way I can find for
this to possibly happen, after staring at the code for far too long.
