I was able to set up this same special remote myself (manually populating remote.log)
and use with my own S3 creds (which of course have no special access rights to this bucket
so it was all public access only), importing into a fresh repository.

Part of that import included:

	import s3-dandiarchive 000345/draft/dandiset.yaml
	  HttpExceptionRequest Request {
	[...]
	   (StatusCodeException (Response {responseStatus = Status {statusCode = 403, statusMessage = "Forbidden"}, responseVersion = HTTP/1.1, responseHeaders = [("x-amz-request-id","T0PNM10TN8STRTK4"),("x-amz-id-2","pqZXYNtU9T0mQxmHvtBjr2weztjwWwP3GleV7Jy5P3DcZbCi7Mt4Kzqo1wpPj9Zy85cZ3CUPHro="),("Content-Type","application/xml"),("Transfer-Encoding","chunked"),("Date","Fri, 02 Jan 2026 15:01:16 GMT"),("Server","AmazonS3")], responseBody = (), responseCookieJar = CJ {expose = []}, responseClose' = ResponseClose, responseOriginalRequest = Request {
	[...]
	  , responseEarlyHints = []}) "<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<Error><Code>AccessDenied</Code><Message>Access Denied</Message><RequestId>T0PNM10TN8STRTK4</RequestId><HostId>pqZXYNtU9T0mQxmHvtBjr2weztjwWwP3GleV7Jy5P3DcZbCi7Mt4Kzqo1wpPj9Zy85cZ3CUPHro=</HostId></Error>")
	ok

But, the import ended with:

	  Failed to import some files from s3-dandiarchive. Re-run command to resume import.

And did not create a branch, so I have not been able to reproduce the
problem.

Digging into why it says "ok" there, that was unfortunately only a display
problem. Corrected that.
