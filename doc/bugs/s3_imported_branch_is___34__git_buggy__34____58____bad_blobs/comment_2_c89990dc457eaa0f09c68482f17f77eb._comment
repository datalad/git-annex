Are the `000675/draft/` files you show it importing the ones that are
access restricted?

And when you replicated the problem from the backup, were you using it in
the configuration where it cannot access those?

I notice that all the files affected seem to be probably smallish text
files (yaml, jsonld). Do you have annex.largefiles configured in this
repository, and are all of the affected files non-annexed files?
If so, it would be worth retrying from the backup with the config changed
so those files get annexed and see if that avoids the problem.
