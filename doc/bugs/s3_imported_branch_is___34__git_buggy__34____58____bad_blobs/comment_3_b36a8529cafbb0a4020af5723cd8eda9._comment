> please advise on how to mitigate (`git reset --hard` the `s3-dandiarchive/master` to prior state before yesterday and reimport with newer git-annex or ... ?)

Simply resetting the remote tracking branch and re-importing won't cause an
import to necessarily happen again. This is because git-annex tracks
internally what has been imported from the remote. Running an import again
when it's already imported files won't re-download those same files.
And it will regenerate the same remote tracking branch.

So running in a clone from a backup is a better way to re-run the import.
