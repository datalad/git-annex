yes -- that one is embargoed (can be seen by going to https://dandiarchive.org/dandiset/000675)

> And when you replicated the problem from the backup, were you using it in the configuration where it cannot access those?

if I got the question right and since I do not recall now -- judging from me using `( source .git/secrets.env; git-annex import master...` I think I was with credentials allowing to access them (hence no errors while importing)

> Do you have annex.largefiles configured in this repository, and are all of the affected files non-annexed files?

yes

```
(venv-annex) dandi@drogon:/mnt/backup/dandi/dandiset-manifests$ grep largefiles .gitattributes
**/.git* annex.largefiles=nothing
* annex.largefiles=((mimeencoding=binary)and(largerthan=0))
```

and it seems all go into git

```
(venv-annex) dandi@drogon:/mnt/backup/dandi/dandiset-manifests$ git annex list
here          
|s3-dandiarchive (untrusted)
||web         
|||bittorrent

```
is empty
