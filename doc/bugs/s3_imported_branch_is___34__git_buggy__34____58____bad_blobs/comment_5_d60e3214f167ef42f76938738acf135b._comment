All being small files does make me think this bug is somehow specfic to
adding the files to git. So it would be very useful to re-run the
reproducer again, with annex.largefiles this time configured so everything
is annexed.

Well that's why I asked. It's not clear to me if it ever did show a failure, 
when used in the configuration where it couldn't access the files.

It seems equally likely that it somehow incorrectly thought it succeeded.
