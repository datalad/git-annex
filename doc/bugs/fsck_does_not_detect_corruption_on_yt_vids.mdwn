### Please describe the problem.

I added a YT vid via addurl and then intentionally corrupted it by rewriting the underlying contents. After doing so, the video was clearly broken, but `git annex fsck` did not detect this.


### What steps will reproduce the problem?

```
$ git annex addurl 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGDzdps75ns'
$ echo test | sudo tee './Small short test video [zGDzdps75ns].webm'
$ git annex fsck './Small short test video [zGDzdps75ns].webm'
fsck Small short test video [zGDzdps75ns].webm ok
(recording state in git...)
$ file -L ./Small\ short\ test\ video\ \[zGDzdps75ns\].webm
./Small short test video [zGDzdps75ns].webm: ASCII text
```

The fsck reports the file is "ok". Even an fsck `--from=web` reports the video is OK:

```
$ git annex fsck './Small short test video [zGDzdps75ns].webm' --from=web
fsck Small short test video [zGDzdps75ns].webm 
ok                                    
(recording state in git...)
```


### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?

### Have you had any luck using git-annex before? (Sometimes we get tired of reading bug reports all day and a lil' positive end note does wonders)

Excited to move my photo collection over to it!
