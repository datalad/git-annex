Many commands do reflect "notneeded" by not displaying any output.

(I suppose that could even be a problem with --json --batch, since
a command like drop will not output anything when it has nothing to do.)

In the case of dropkey, it could have skipped displaying anything for keys
that don't exist, but changing that now doesn't seem wise.
