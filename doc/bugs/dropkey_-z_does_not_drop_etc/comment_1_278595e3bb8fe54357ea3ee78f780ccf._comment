You are piping non-null-terminated output into a command that needs 
terminating nulls. So, it reads the entire findkeys output, including
newlines as the name of a key. And drops that key, which doesn't exist of
course.

With `findkeys --print0`, it does work. It would also be fine to not use
`-z`, since keys should never actually contain a newline in their name.
