okay, after disabling chunking, it still doesn't work.

it seems that it's completely stuck: i haven't seen the assistant transfer any new files yet. using `git annex move` seems to work:

<pre>
www-data@ip-10-87-135-88:/persistent/media$ git annex move --to s3
move video/mp4_sd/-_cineastas_indigenas_ntsc_-_eng_0.mov.mp4 (checking s3...) ok
</pre>
