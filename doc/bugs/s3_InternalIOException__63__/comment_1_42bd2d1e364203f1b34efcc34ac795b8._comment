Are you sure that it was subsequent transfers of other keys that failed,
and not subsequent transfers of chunks of the same key?

The latter seems more likely. There is a cached connection to S3 that is
reused when uploading chunks of a key. But, each transfer of a key
currently runs using its own individual connection. Difficulties with
connections that close or are left running too long are why the S3 remote
doesn't yet reuse connections.
