### Please describe the problem.

annex add  seems to ignore content under directories having . prefix.

We thought to unify (across direct/indirect/v6) adding files to annex repository by using 'git annex add' with corresponding setting for largefiles for any addition, but it seems to ignore content under .-prefixed directories, unlike git

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?

6.20161122+gitg9f179ae-1~ndall+1

### Please provide any additional information below.
