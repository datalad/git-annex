WRT haskell static linking, AFAIK that only affects haskell libraries. If they in turn link with C libs, the linking is still dynamic. At least this is the case on both Linux and the limited BSDs I've used it on. Have no OpenBSD experience.

`SOL_SOCKET` is 1 on linux, so you may have the culprit.

However.. That's a really old version of network! 2.2.1.8 is from 2010. In a more current 2.4.x version, packSocketOption uses the `SOL_SOCKET` value and not 1, so should work AFAICS.
