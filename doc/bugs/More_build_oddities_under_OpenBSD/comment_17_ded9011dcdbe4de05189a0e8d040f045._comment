Blow away ~/.ghc and ~/.cabal; cabal update; put `library-profiling: True` in ~/.cabal/config; and reinstall everything.

Note that you may need to first build ghc's own bundled libraries with profiling support, if your ghc installation does not already include them. I don't know how to do that since on debian I can just `apt-get install ghc-prof`. If that's needed, ghc will tell you and refuse to build stuff with profiling.
