What I did was to temporarily move away (or rename) the offending libs. What I essentially did was this:

    cabal configure
    cabal build
    sudo mv /usr/local/lib/lib{xml2,gnutls,gsasl,idn}.a /tmp
    cabal install
    sudo mv /tmp/lib{xml2,gnutls,gsasl,idn}.a /usr/local/lib

but I've also had to patch network-info. I've contacted the maintainer of that package but I haven't received anything. I'm considering creating an actual fork with my changes but that would almost seem kind of silly as I don't know *ANY* haskell.. But I am looking at the Haskell wiki as I'm typing this so I can see what I'm looking at :).

Won't break anything by not setting SO_REUSEADDR? I suspect you're setting it for a reason?
