So you moved away libs in /usr/local to expose usable ones in /usr? 

I've had luck before sending the network-info mantainer pull requests: <https://github.com/jystic/network-info/issues/3>

git-annex does set ReuseAddr in one place; in Utility/Webapp.hs. The only time that would have a benefit would be when using `git annex webapp --listen=address:port` and starting and restarting the webapp. Normally the webapp chooses a random free port so it shouldn't need that.
