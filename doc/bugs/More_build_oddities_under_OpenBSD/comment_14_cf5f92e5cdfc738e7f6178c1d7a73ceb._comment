Sigh.. Ofcourse it was an old version. It never occurred to me to check that. I was just Googling around and stumbled over that page.
Do you have any pointers on how I would debug this further?

Regarding the linking; I haven't checked it any further actually. I'm planning on investigating that further once I can get this error sorted out. But my hypothesis is that it's all statically linked all the way through, like I said. That would also explain those error messages I got during linking before.
