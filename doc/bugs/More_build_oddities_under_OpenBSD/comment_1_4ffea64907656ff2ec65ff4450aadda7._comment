This is definitely not an issue in git-annex's code. Two C libraries are exporting the same symbol (gnulib might be the other one, or it could be part of the OpenBSD libc as it's some deprecated POSIX symbol, I don't know) and this is simply not apparent until the linker tries to make a binary linking with both.

I have dealt with a similar issue on Android by modifying C libraries to not export colliding symbols. See:
