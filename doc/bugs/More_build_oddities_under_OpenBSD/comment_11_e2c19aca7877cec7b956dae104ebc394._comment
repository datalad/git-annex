I honestly have no idea why that move works because

    % ls -lh /usr/lib|grep -E '(gsasl|xml2|gnutls|idn)'

returns nothing. But couldn't those symbols already be in the other libraries considering, from what I've read at least, haskell stuff are statically compiled by default?

Anyway, you are completely right that this happened when I try to use XMPP. The reason I was looking in the wrong place to begin with was because the webapp spit out the error messsage. I have redirected my attention to the network library and the xmpp library.

But I might have found something interesting in the network library. Keep in mind that I just learned a little today, so do correct me if I'm wrong.

Looking at http://hackage.haskell.org/package/network-2.2.1.8/docs/src/Network-Socket.html I found:
    setSocketOption :: Socket 
                    -> SocketOption -- Option Name
                    -> Int          -- Option Value
                    -> IO ()
    setSocketOption (MkSocket s _ _ _ _) so v = do
       with (fromIntegral v) $ \ptr_v -> do
       throwErrnoIfMinus1_ \"setSocketOption\" $
           c_setsockopt s (socketOptLevel so) (packSocketOption so) ptr_v
              (fromIntegral (sizeOf v))
       return ()

Everything here looks good. So I decided to take a look at SocketOption, socketOptLevel and packSocketOption.
    data SocketOption
        = DummySocketOption__
        | Debug         {- SO_DEBUG     -}
        | ReuseAddr     {- SO_REUSEADDR -}
        | Type          {- SO_TYPE      -}
        | SoError       {- SO_ERROR     -}
        | DontRoute     {- SO_DONTROUTE -}
        | Broadcast     {- SO_BROADCAST -}
        | SendBuffer    {- SO_SNDBUF    -}
        | RecvBuffer    {- SO_RCVBUF    -}
        | KeepAlive     {- SO_KEEPALIVE -}
        | OOBInline     {- SO_OOBINLINE -}
        | TimeToLive    {- IP_TTL       -}
        | MaxSegment    {- TCP_MAXSEG   -}
        | NoDelay       {- TCP_NODELAY  -}
        | Linger        {- SO_LINGER    -}
        | RecvLowWater  {- SO_RCVLOWAT  -}
        | SendLowWater  {- SO_SNDLOWAT  -}
        | RecvTimeOut   {- SO_RCVTIMEO  -}
        | SendTimeOut   {- SO_SNDTIMEO  -}

    socketOptLevel :: SocketOption -> CInt
    socketOptLevel so = 
      case so of
        TimeToLive   -> 0
        MaxSegment   -> 6
        NoDelay      -> 6
        _            -> 1

    packSocketOption :: SocketOption -> CInt
    packSocketOption so =
      case so of
        Debug         -> 1
        ReuseAddr     -> 2
        Type          -> 3
        SoError       -> 4
        DontRoute     -> 5
        Broadcast     -> 6
        SendBuffer    -> 7
        RecvBuffer    -> 8
        KeepAlive     -> 9
        OOBInline     -> 10
        TimeToLive    -> 2
        MaxSegment    -> 2
        NoDelay       -> 1
        Linger	  -> 13
        RecvLowWater  -> 18
        SendLowWater  -> 19
        RecvTimeOut   -> 20
        SendTimeOut   -> 21

Everything looks good so I thought long and hard about this. Then, by chance, I just looked at the man page for setsockopt() and it mentioned SOL_SOCKET and I was like \"Hmm...\"

    % grep -R SOL_SOCKET /usr/include
    /usr/include/openssl/e_os.h:#define ioctlsocket(a,b,c)            setsockopt((a),SOL_SOCKET,(b),(c),sizeof(*(c)))
    /usr/include/sys/socket.h:#define       SOL_SOCKET      0xffff          /* options for socket level */
    /usr/include/sys/socket.h:/* Read using getsockopt() with SOL_SOCKET, SO_PEERCRED */

Wat?

    #define SOL_SOCKET 0xffff

Going back to the Haskell code above I realized that SetSocketOption will NEVER feed 0xffff as level to setsockopt() because socketOptLevel returns 1 unless optname is TimeToLive, MaxSegment or NoDelay.

Am I way off?
