### Please describe the problem.

git-annex requires a `gpg -> gpg2` alias, which is dangerous for other software to misuse.

### What steps will reproduce the problem?

Run any gpg-requiring operation on a machine that has only gpg2 installed and no gpg alias.

    gpg: createProcess: runInteractiveProcess: exec: does not exist (No such file or directory)

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?

git-annex version: 5.20150710

OS X, gpg2 installed with brew

### Have you had any luck using git-annex before?

git-annex took some time to get in the mentality and configure, but now it's a beautiful perfectly oiled file management system. Thanks!
