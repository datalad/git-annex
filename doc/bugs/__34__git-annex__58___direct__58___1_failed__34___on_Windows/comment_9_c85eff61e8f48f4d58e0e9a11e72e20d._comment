Workaround: Enable long paths in the windows registry. See
<https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa365247#maxpath>

It would be good to make git-annex enable that automatically, perhaps by
using the manifest file that is described on that page. I don't know
how to make windows use such a manifest file. It seems to have to be
embedded into the exe file. GHC has a open ticket to get it to do that:
