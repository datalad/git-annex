I've started a `relativepaths` branch that uses all relative paths to the git repo. After working on it for several hours, there are still 16 test suite failures (update: 10) (update: 1). The potential for uncaught breakage is much higher than I am happy with. (Amoung other problems, git-annex does call setCurrentDirectory in several places, and this utterly breaks the relative paths).

Using that branch on windows, I am still unable to add files with --backend=SHA512; even relative paths don't make it short enough for such keys.
