I've beat on the relativepaths branch some more and am probably as confident about it as I'm going to get. Will have to merge it and see what else it breaks.

Also, I've documented that SHA512  and other large hashes are not recommended if one wants to interop with Windows.

None of which completely fixes this bug, but short of teaching git about the magic filename prefix to make windows not be so broken, I don't see anything more I can do.
