### Please describe the problem.
Two androids, A and B, and a computer, C. All running git annex assistant.
If you edit a file on A while A is offline, when A is back online and reconnects, that file will disappear from C and, in B, it will be substituted by a link
If you create a new file on A, that file will appear as a link in B and in C


### What steps will reproduce the problem?
- Have A, B, and C be connected sharing some repo. Create a file, file1. Let it propagate, so file1 is on A, B, C.

- Take A offline (e.g., turn wifi off).

- Edit file1 in A.

- Create file2 in A.

- (Let those files appear in the repo in A as in
[2015-02-27 20:55:04 CET] Committer: Adding file1
add file1 ok
)

- Turn the wifi of A on again.

- Sync A from the webapp (clik on sync now)

- In B (the other android) both file1 and file2 will contain just links, not the actual content of file1 and file2.

- In the computer, file1 will have disappeared and file2 will be a link that points nowhere. (The link that file2 points too, as a string, are the contents of file2 in B).
