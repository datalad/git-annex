Not sure if this is the real reason, but I get a bunch of

>curl: symbol lookup error: /usr/lib/libssl.so.1.0.0: undefined symbol: EVP_idea_cbc

errors in the git-annex log. Running nm on the lib produces the following:

>$ nm /usr/lib/libssl.so.1.0.0 | grep EVP_idea_cbc<br>
>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;U EVP_idea_cbc

...where \"U\" means undefined. I think the reason 64-bit does not work is that there is no curl (and lsof) binaries and libs included.
