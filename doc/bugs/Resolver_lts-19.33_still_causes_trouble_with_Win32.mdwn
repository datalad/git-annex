### Please describe the problem.

I'm sorry for barking up the same tree once again but the change of resolver to LTS 19 (now lts-19.33)
still causes stack builds to fail on Windows with a plan construction problem. Joey pinned Win32 as 
`Win32-2.11.1.0` in extra-deps and while that might be sufficient on Linux, on Windows stack seems to
be rather picky and wants to have none of it. In fact my bumbling around with editing `stack.yaml`
trying to placate the Haskell Stack gods has only found a single solution to the predicament and that is
to pin Win32 as `Win32-2.9.0.0` (sic! -- due to the dependencies for `haskeline`) and do similarly with
a few other GHC boot packages including `Cabal`. This setup then builds and tests just fine. (There is
a patch to `stack.yaml` below.)

I know `Win32-2.9.0.0` is a bit long in the tooth (although, who knows, maybe it works equally well
for git-annex' purposes?) but I wonder do we have a choice if we want to keep aws-0.24 in the configuration?

### What steps will reproduce the problem?

`stack setup && stack build`. Observe the following output:

[[!format sh """
Error: [S-4804]
       Stack failed to construct a build plan.

       While constructing the build plan, Stack encountered the following errors:

### Have you had any luck using git-annex before? (Sometimes we get tired of reading bug reports all day and a lil' positive end note does wonders)

Git Annex is great. I use it several times a week with my multigigabyte backups, where it gives structure to my image-based backup routines, so you could say I'm a believer. :)
