I don't think this is a bug in git-annex. That is the behavior of
`git-remote-gcrypt`. Could you please file a bug on that program instead?

(I've also wondered about this; it could be that it's re-uploading the
manifest every time for good security reasons, or it could be that a better
file structure would allow more incremental uploads. It certianly
seems like it could avoid re-uploading when nothing has changed!)
