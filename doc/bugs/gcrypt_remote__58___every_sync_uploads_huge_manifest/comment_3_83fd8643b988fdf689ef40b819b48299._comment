It should be possible for git-annex to support rsync:// for gcrypt special
remotes; that would just need to reuse the rsync special remote for the
git-annex objects. Retitling this bug report appropriately.

In the meantime, it should work to set up a gcrypt git remote (not a
git-annex special remote) using rsync:// or sftp:// and then use a
git-annex rsync special remote on the same server to store the annex
objects.

But that doesn't help with large pushes to gcrypt remotes
when git hosting providers are being used, which is a main 
use case for using gcrypt (though generally not the gcrypt special remote).
The lack of incrementals there seems like something worth finding a way to
fix in gcrypt.
