I think I should probably just remove that. It's not being maintained.

Adding it to the cabal file so it gets built would slow down builds
producing this extra binary. It would need to be handled as a multicall
program in git-annex the way git-annex-shell and git-remote-tor-annex are.

Do you have a reason to want to use it?
