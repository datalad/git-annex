**Premise:**

I've had this problem before 5.20140709-gc75193e and when the [ugly bug](http://git-annex.branchable.com/devblog/day_193-194__ugly_bug/) was discovered and fixed, I updated and thought it was gone.
Yet, I'm still experiencing a content removal bug, so it might be something different altogether.
I should also add that I'm not really knowledgeable with the git log history tools and git-annex inner workings. I might need some help with finding the necessary information for debugging.

**Bug description:**

Two local computers, running Ubuntu-14.04 and Fedora-20 respectively, are paired through the assistant and functional with git annex 5.20140709. In direct mode. Most of the time, everything seems to work fine. Sometimes, *Computer A* will modify one file in its repository while the *B* is offline. When *B* comes back online both repositories will lose their copy of the modified file (I'm not sure whether this also happens when they're both online when the change happens; it doesn't look like it anyway). The rest of the data in the repository is intact. This does not happen every time and I haven't been able to reproduce it consistently. Since 5.20140709 came out, it happened 2 or 3 times.

Looking at 'git log --stat' in *B*:

    commit d9eb9e94a39
    Author: COMPUTER B

    commit 6fa27f08492
    Author: COMPUTER A
    Date:   Thu Jul 17 18:17:14 2014 +0200
      shared.skg | 1 +

    commit d25cc793739
    Author: COMPUTER A
    Date:   Thu Jul 17 18:17:12 2014 +0200
      shared.skg | 1 -
      1 file changed, 1 deletion(-)

When things go well, it only does 1 deletion and 1 insertion (a change is apparently deleting and rewriting the file, maybe because it's a binary (encrypted) file?). The third most recent deletion is probably the one that shouldn't happen.

Reverting "d9eb9e94a39" will only recover a placeholder, not really the original file. I can get the content back by going through *git annex unused* with *git log -S'key'*, then going to indirect mode, and then using *addunused*.
