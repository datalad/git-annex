### Please describe the problem.
The webapp does not offer me the option to delete a remote repository that it did not succeed to synchronize with. Status of the repository is sync enabled (metadata only) but in settings I may only edit the repo, but cannot delete it.

### What steps will reproduce the problem?
Set up git-annex on a new computer. Forget to enable ssh on the machine. Perform a local pairing (success). The sync fails for obvious reasons.

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?
System is ubuntu but I assume this is a general issue. Version of git-annex is 5.20140117
