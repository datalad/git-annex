### Please describe the problem.

Whenever I leave git-annex to do a long operation on a remote server, I came
back to its eventual death. I leave a `git-annex get ... -J 4` on a tmux at a
server it eventually freezes, so I tend to rely on my machine and
short/repetitive operations to be able to use git-annex. Before I thought the
parallelization might be the issue so I reduced it to 4 from 8/16/32, but it
didn't resolve the problem.

This last time I wanted to investigate and I found out a lot of subprocess
hanging around.

```sh
$ ps -u <me> | grep git
2460230 pts31   00:00:00 git <defunct>
2460231 pts31   00:00:00 git <defunct>
2460232 pts31   00:00:00 git <defunct>
2460233 pts31   00:00:00 git <defunct>
2460234 pts31   00:00:00 git <defunct>
2460235 pts31   00:00:00 git <defunct>
2460237 pts31   00:00:00 git <defunct>
...
$ ps -u <me> | grep git | wc -l
13193
```

Which explains why lowering parallel jobs didn't resolve but delay the eventual
freeze.

On this setup the version is old which might be the culprit. Although I can try
to get an updated version (via binary or conda) on my path, I would still like
to identify the problem. It also happened on another server setup which had a
relatively newer version but since I have no access to there anymore, I can't
provide more information on that (yet).

### What steps will reproduce the problem?

Run `$ git annex get * -J 4` and wait for eventual freeze

### Have you had any luck using git-annex before? (Sometimes we get tired of reading bug reports all day and a lil' positive end note does wonders)

I use it for all kind of data I have both in private and at work. Amazing
piece of software. I'm sure my colleagues/IT are annoyed of me plugging it to
every possible discussion.
