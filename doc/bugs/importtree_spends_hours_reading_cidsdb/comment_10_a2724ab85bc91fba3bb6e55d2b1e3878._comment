What's the last thing output before it enters this state? I know it's at some
point after the last "import filename... ok" but I haven't a clue what it
could be.

For what it's worth, I straced the importing stage, and there are no reads
from the database FDs at all. Presumably sqlite realizes its empty and
doesn't need to keep re-reading to respond to the queries done in that
stage. Each file imported took 113 syscalls (there are small files, so only
1 syscall needed to read the content).

I also attached a strace immediately after it finished the importing stage,
and straced all the way to the end (importing 1000 files). There was not a
single `pread64`. FD #14 was already closed at that point, and the cidsdb
was never accessed again. 

Which matches my reading of the code that it never accesses the cidsdb after
that point. Which makes what you're seeing very strange indeed.

Something is missing to let me reproduce this. Can you reproduce it with
the script I posted in comment #1?

----

Also straced an entire import of 1000 files, and this is all the preads
from fd 14 (there were a similar amount with 3 other fds)

	joey@darkstar:~/tmp>egrep 'pread64.14' /tmp/strace
	pread64(14, "", 8, 512)                 = 0
	pread64(14, "", 100, 0)                 = 0
	pread64(14, "", 16, 24)                 = 0
	pread64(14, "\0\0\0\1\0\0\0\1\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0", 16, 24) = 16
	pread64(14, "SQLite format 3\0\20\0\2\2\0@  \0\0\0\1\0\0\0\1"..., 4096, 0) = 4096
