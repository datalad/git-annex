Here's the final timing from the second test case with 
150000 files after all of the above optimisation:

1. 0m0.131s
2. 33m40.490s
3. 0m41.027s
4. 2m59.070s
5. 14m5.679s
6. 0m3.673s
7. 17m39.271s
8. 11m15.317s

(git-annex get from an importtree remote was also sped up a lot;
it makes the same cid queries as sync #7)

I'm satisfied with this, considering this bug done, unless it's
somehow still being slow for you.
