My apologies for forgetting that.

So initially I thought it was after the last \"import source... ok\".  I'm no longer convinced that it happens after the last one.  There is clearly a phase before this starts, and a separate phase exhibiting this behavior.

The last output from one of these runs was:


```
/acrypt/git-annex/bind-ro/testdata/dvd/var..redacted..: openBinaryFile: permission denied (Permission denied)
^Mok

  Failed to import some files from source. Re-run command to resume import.
```

And indeed there were about 2 dozen files out of that source set that it didn't have the permission to read.

I'm sorry it looked like expansion of scope.  This is not really on NTFS; it's still on ZFS as it has been from the beginning.  I had been testing with one of the repos on NTFS previously but in an effort to rule that out, I've been 100% on ZFS since before reporting this issue.  \"acrypt\" is just the name of my ZFS pool and that refers to that it's atop LUKS (I don't believe this to be relevant, since the CPU time is in git-annex, not kcryptd)
