Hi Joey,

Would it be helpful for you if I ran the instrumented version here?

Also I suspect that the time spent reading cidsdb scales exponentially rather than linearly with the number of files.  Or perhaps there's a magic spot somewhere (an in-memory cache limit?) that causes the excessive time.  Anyhow, I'm happy to do whatever I can to help.

Thanks!
