It would make a lot of sense for --content syncing to be what remains slow.
That has to scan over all the files and when it decides that it does not
need to copy the content anywhere, that's a tight loop with no output.

In my repo with 10000 files that was set up by the latest test case,
`git-annex sync` takes 13 seconds, and with --content it takes 61 seconds.

I optimised a numcopies/mincopies lookup away, and that got it
down to 28 seconds. 

The cidsdb does not get accessed by the --content scan
in my testing, although there may be other situations where it does.
