Initial sync: 39:01.37

Then `git-annex import master:testdata --from source` 
with no changed files: 8:36.30  
(This is writing the cidsdb since the initial sync no 
longer does, see comment #2)

Subsequent imports with no changed files: 0:37.21

Subsequent syncs with no changed files: 3:18.61

Subsequent syncs with no changed files, when not on an adjusted branch: 0:38.40

That 37 second run time for an import with no changed files seems to
indicate that my optimisation so far was successful at eliminating all
cidsdb reading. It's bottlenecked on git operations now.

I also tried an initial import of 150000 files to see how much of that
initial sync was other work than the import (updating adjusted branch,
checking out files, etc).

Initial import: 38:24.36

So the initial sync is mostly spending time on imports, not other stuff.
It could perhaps be sped up some. Of course it does support -J2 which may
speed it up throuh parallism.

Seems like a sync with no changed files on an adjusted branch is doing
unncessary work to update the adjusted branch when nothing has changed.
