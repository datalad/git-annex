I was able to eliminate that extra work. Now the first sync does not write
to the cidsdb but only to the git-annex branch, and the second sync does
the necessary work of updating the cidsdb from the git-annex branch.

I'm not sure that extra work is what the bug reporter was complaining
about though.
