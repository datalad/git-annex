Well, this is a case where `git add` is failing for some reason. It seems
very likely that it output some error message to stderr, so I'd look for
that in the log. It's not clear to me if your grep would show that.

If `git add` was silent on stderr, then I'd move on to thinking it must
have crashed  (or have a weird bug). The 123 exit code is from xargs and
only indicates that `git add` exited nonzero, so we don't know what the
actual exit code was. But it seems that `git add` did not die of a
segfault; it if had the exit code from xargs would be 125.

Since git-annex is batching up some number of files and sending them all to
a single `git add`, the files that come last would fail to be added if any
earlier file somehow caused `git add` to give up. So that could explain why
it happens more often for some files.
