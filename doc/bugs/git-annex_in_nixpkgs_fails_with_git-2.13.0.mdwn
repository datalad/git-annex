### Please describe the problem.

Tests fail on Nix when git is upgraded to 2.13.


### What steps will reproduce the problem?

On NixOS or a system with Nix installed, check out nixpkgs ce8662e693b5756e8457d94bb1765d853310afdb, try to build git-annex (`nix-build -I . -A pkgs.gitAndTools.gitAnnex`).


### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?

git-annex 6.20170321 on Nix ce8662e6.


### Please provide any additional information below.

I ran a git bisect that concluded:

[[!format sh """
8 out of 285 tests failed (281.73s)
  (This could be due to a bug in git-annex, or an incompatibility
   with utilities, such as git, installed on this system.)

### Have you had any luck using git-annex before? (Sometimes we get tired of reading bug reports all day and a lil' positive end note does wonders)

git-annex is an essential building block in my digital life style! It keeps backups of all my precious family photos. I'm a big git-annex shill when I get the chance, especially to nix, guix and decentralized hacker types.
