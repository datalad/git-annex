The solution to your build failure is to edit ~/.cabal/config and remove
the extra-prog-path line. (It's unfortunate that Debian shipped 8.3 with
that bug. I told them about it before the release, but they didn't get it
fixed in time.)

There are probably several other config settings that also break 
the test suite if set in a global gitconfig. For example the
annex.addunlocked setting I added yesterday will.

I think the best approach is to isolate the the test suite from global git
config settings. Making the test suite set `GIT_CONFIG` to the config of
each test repo it runs git-annex in seems like it would
work; this prevents git from reading the user and global configs.

The test suite could set all config values to defaults
in the test git repos. But this would need some restructuring of the code to
be able to not just query, but also set those values.
