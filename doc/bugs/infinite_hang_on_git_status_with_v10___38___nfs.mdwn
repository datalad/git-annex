### Please describe the problem.

There appears to be some locking-related pain with git annex v10 on NFS.

Specifically, git status, git annex status, and seemingly everything that uses git-annex filter-process will hang forever.

### What steps will reproduce the problem?

(approximately)
```
git init && git annex init --version 10
(add some large file, commit)
git annex sync
git status # hangs forever
git annex status # hangs forever
git annex info # actually works, and produces typical output
git diff path/to/normal-file.txt # also hangs
git annex version # actually works, and produces typical output
```

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?

Git annex installed from the latest standalone amd64 tarball. I verified that both `which git` and `which git-annex` point to the scripts/binaries in that tarball.

Running Ubuntu 20.04, with ~/ (where binaries are) and /workspaces (where the repo is) on NFS. `mount -v` shows the following (clipped and IPs obscured)

```
srv:/path on /workspaces type nfs4 (rw,noatime,vers=4.0,rsize=1048576,wsize=1048576,namlen=255,hard,proto=tcp,timeo=600,retrans=2,sec=sys,clientaddr=XXXX,local_lock=none,addr=XXXX)           
```

.git/config contains (anonymised)
```
[annex]
        uuid = UUID_HERE
        version = 10
        pidlock = true
```


### Please provide any additional information below.


As a workaround, I deleted all files from .git/annex EXCEPT for the objects directory, then did `git annex init --version=9`, and reset the UUID to what it was before. I then ran git annex fsck, and it all seemed to function correctly with no hangs. But, a few commands later, I noticed we were back at version=10, and the problem recurred. I set `annex.autoupgraderepository = false`, again nuked .git/annex, set version=8 this time in the config file and with git annex init --version 8 and it seems were good and stable for now.


### Have you had any luck using git-annex before? (Sometimes we get tired of reading bug reports all day and a lil' positive end note does wonders)

A great deal! We're managing tens of TB of plant genomics data with git annex, and it's a life saver, so many many thanks Joey et al. I know NFS is a bit of an edge case in git-annex land, but for the majority of git-annex's scientific users, NFS is all we have.
