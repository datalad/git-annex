After wasting 20 minutes on github's atrocious mess of an interface, I
managed to download some raw logs that I can look at in something that does
not freeze the javascript interpreter constantly while searching for "FAIL". 
(This is quite a mess to inflict on yourself all in the name of proprietary
monoculture, just saying.)

Full relevant except:

Very odd that it omits any mention of what subtest failed. I have a feeling
this log only contains stdout and not stderr, or something other weird is
happening. Probably if that were not missing it would say "test harness
self-test failed".

gpg communicates with the agent over a unix socket. On linux, the path 
to a socket is limited to 109 bytes. The test is being run in 
"/home/runner/work/datalad-extensions/datalad-extensions/build/git-annex-8.20200309+git101-ga51a94f61"
which is 100 bytes. Add ".t/gpgtest/" and the name of the socket, and it's too
long.

Quick fix is to cd to /tmp or something before running the test suite.
