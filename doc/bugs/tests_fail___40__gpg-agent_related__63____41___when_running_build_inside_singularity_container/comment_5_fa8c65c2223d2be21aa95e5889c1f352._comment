Reproduced on a host that is not behind a satellite http cache.

My earlier change did not fix it. With my change, GNUPGHOME is something like
"../gpgtmp/1". So the version of gpg in this singularity must be converting
that relative path to an absolute path, too long for a socket path.
Which seems like kind of ridiculous behavior, but gpg does `chdir()` in
places so maybe that's why.

Tried a few changes, including removing --use-agent and --no-tty
(it still tries to use the agent), using --no-use-agent
(option is obsolete and it still tries to use the agent).

Affected version of gnupg is 2.2.12, and I think 2.2.20 does not behave
that way, because it always puts the gpg agent socket in
/run/user/uuid/gnupg/ not in GNUPGHOME. (OTOH, the docs for gpg say 
it uses the standard socket since 2.1.) Or something about the singularity
environment could be altering gpg's behavior.

Anyway, this is kind of ridiculous behavior from gpg, and the only thing
I can see that git-annex could do to avoid it is set GNUPGHOME to some
short path in /tmp. But then git-annex would have to not honor TMPDIR
for that, because that could be set to some path that is too long. Ignoring
TMPDIR would be easily argued to be a bug in git-annex, while this is pretty
clearly a bug in an old version of gpg.
