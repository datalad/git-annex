Note that I'm assuming that bar is a remote of both foo and of quux.
That seems like a reasonable reading of what you described, and is a
reasonable configuration, but perhaps you were trying to describe some
other configuration. 

In [[forum/mesh_configurations]] you seem to instead
describe a chain of remotes, where bar is a remote of foo, and quux is a
remote of bar: `foo -> bar -> quux`. In this configuration, running the assistant on 
foo and quux, but not on bar, would not result in changes made on quux
ever getting to foo, because quux has no way to push objects to bar. So, I
don't think that's the configuration you meant either. But lack of clarity
in bug report makes it hard to know.
