Dear Joey, many thanks for your useful reply. Now I understand that better. I tried your fix and it worked - no there are no complaints and the files are being synced.

However, in my /annex/objects there is 1.9Gb, while in the cloned repo there are only 20 Mb of data synced. Do you have any ideas of what could be done? Should I ask at the forum? Many thanks anyway. 

Now I think this is not a bug of git-annex, but I still think that the documentation for that could be improved. Should I delete this report, move it to the forum or anything?
