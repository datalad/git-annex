### Please describe the problem.

git status reports having staged changes and no changes from index

```shell
(git-annex) dandi@drogon:/mnt/backup/dandi/dandisets/000026$ git status
On branch draft
Your branch is up to date with 'github/draft'.

Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
        modified:   .dandi/assets.json

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")

(git-annex) dandi@drogon:/mnt/backup/dandi/dandisets/000026$ git annex status
M ./.dandi/assets.json
```

although git shows no diff and sha256 checksum corresponds to the key:

```shell
(git-annex) dandi@drogon:/mnt/backup/dandi/dandisets/000026$ git diff --cached
(git-annex) dandi@drogon:/mnt/backup/dandi/dandisets/000026$ git show -- .dandi/assets.json

```

I think may be the tricky part is that I have it of 

```
(git-annex) dandi@drogon:/mnt/backup/dandi/dandisets/000026$ git config annex.version
10
```

although I thought that we kept it at 8 but I have user wider config setting

```
(git-annex) dandi@drogon:/mnt/backup/dandi/dandisets/000026$ git config filter.annex.process
git-annex filter-process
```

I was recommended to speed up operations while avoiding upgrade to  10, but I guess running most recent version once lead to the upgrade since all the other repos are still at 8 as I thought it would be

```
(git-annex) dandi@drogon:/mnt/backup/dandi/dandisets/000026$ grep -h '\<version =' ../*/.git/config | sort | uniq -c
      1         version = 10
    186         version = 8
```

having it reported modified causes our script which does sanity check to operate only on clean repo to fail.

`git reset --hard` seems mitigated that

```
(git-annex) dandi@drogon:/mnt/backup/dandi/dandisets/000026$ git reset --hard
HEAD is now at b859efed7d [backups2datalad] 66 files added
(git-annex) dandi@drogon:/mnt/backup/dandi/dandisets/000026$ git status
On branch draft
Your branch is up to date with 'github/draft'.

nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

all.  I will now rerun our script and see in what state I would end up (although, once again, I ended up in version 10 of the repo already, so may be behavior would be different). 

### What steps will reproduce the problem?

I think I get it after I `annex move` and then `annex get` that file back. Just for my own reference -- git-annex repo is result of the https://github.com/dandi/dandisets/blob/draft/tools/backups2datalad-update-cron 


### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?

10.20220822-g84f1875 (conda build), originally observed on earlier 10.20220724-ge30d846
