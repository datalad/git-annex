I have verified that an interrupted repair results in data loss, when
.git/objects contains pack files.

Fixed that. Which leaves 2 open questions:

* Was the assistant interrupted somehow while it was running repair, in
  Atemu's case? That could have been anything from the laptop being
  powered off, to it being stopped explicitly, to it crashing.
* What caused the assistant to think it needed repair in the first place?

Although the answer to the second question doesn't matter much if the
data loss bug is fixed -- if there's a problem of some kind causing
unnecessary repairs, it would only be some excess CPU load.
