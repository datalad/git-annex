If the assistant crashed in the middle of a repair that confirms my
analysis, and my fix will avoid both the data loss problem *and* the crash.

Only remaining question to me is why would it trigger an unnecessary repair.

But that could be anything that causes git fsck to exit nonzero. Or it
might be that git fsck found an actual problem, but not one that was
preventing the repo from working. Eg, a missing/corrupt object used
somewhere deep in the history.

(Note that git-repair already exists. git-annex integrates it.)
