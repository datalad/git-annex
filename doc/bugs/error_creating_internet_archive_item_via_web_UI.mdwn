### Have you had any luck using git-annex before? (Sometimes we get tired of reading bug reports all day and a lil' positive end note does wonders)

I recently started trying to use it to manage photos, but I'm struggling a bit to get my head around it.
Today I'm trying to use it to archive my open source software downloads.
