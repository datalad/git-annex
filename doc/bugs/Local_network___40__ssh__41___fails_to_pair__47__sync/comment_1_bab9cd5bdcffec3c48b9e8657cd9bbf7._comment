Oh, that's odd...

The Mythbuntu machine says it fails and the laptop screen still says pairing, but a new window on the laptop says that it synced with the Mythbuntu server. On the Mythbuntu server, it has a blank entry for the laptop, which if you click to edit says \"Internal Server Error\" \"Unknown UUID\".

When I add things on the laptop, they immediately become shortcuts and an equivalent shortcut appears on the Mythbuntu machine, though updates to the content (in this case a text file) are not sychronised. 

Adding a file on the Mythbuntu machine does not turn into a shortcut and nothing appears on the laptop.
