Remote mythbuntuserver.local_annex does not have git-annex installed; setting remote.mythbuntuserver.local_annex.annex-ignore

So, how did you install git-annex on mythbuntuserver? What does the `.ssh/authorized_keys` on mythbuntuserver look like? (In particular the key that git-annex adds to it, which should be set to run git-annex-shell.)
