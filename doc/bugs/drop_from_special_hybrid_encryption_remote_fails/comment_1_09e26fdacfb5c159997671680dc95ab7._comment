What kind of special remote is this? In fact, can you just paste the output
of `git annex info thenameoftheremote`

There are plenty of reasons that an operation like a drop can fail,
most of which are not bugs, but some kind of configuration problem,
an inaccessible remote, etc. Most or all of them should come with a
useful error message though..
