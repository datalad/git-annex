### Please describe the problem.

Using the latest build, when the agent is started, it works ... and works ... and works ... until it silently dies at some point.

### What steps will reproduce the problem?

I hope this will reproduce:

* Create a remote with an invalid host which is not reachable
* Start git-annex-autostart.vbs
* Wait 5-30 minutes until no git.exe/git-annex.exe are visible any more in task manager (for my current test it took 10 minutes)
* Inspect the logs

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?

    $ git annex version
    git-annex version: 5.20140715-g622a376
    build flags: Assistant Webapp Webapp-secure Pairing Testsuite S3 WebDAV DNS Feeds Quvi TDFA CryptoHash
    key/value backends: SHA256E SHA1E SHA512E SHA224E SHA384E SKEIN256E SKEIN512E SHA256 SHA1 SHA512 SHA224 SHA384 SKEIN256 SKEIN512 WORM URL
    remote types: git gcrypt S3 bup directory rsync web webdav tahoe glacier ddar hook external
    local repository version: 5
    supported repository version: 5
    upgrade supported from repository versions: 2 3 4

### Please provide any additional information below.

I hope/think that this is also related to what I wrote in:
https://git-annex.branchable.com/forum/Restricting_SSH_+_supply_key

Here the assistant apparently takes the wrong ssh.exe (from bin/ instead than cmd/ directory). This results in the fact that for some reason .ssh/config is not used.
In any case, the host alias can not be resolved.
At some point git annex assistant seems to die because of that, but I am not sure.
In any case, a non-reachable server should not be the cause that the assistant dies.
The last entries of daemon.log are always:

    git-annex: <stdin>: hGetLine: invalid argument (Bad file descriptor)
    failed
    git-annex: assistant: 1 failed 

So I think this is the cause.
