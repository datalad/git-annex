The command `git annex find --want-drop --in m2`
finds files that meet 2 criteria:

1. Present in the m2 remote. In this case, that is file3.
2. Are not wanted to be present in the repository in which you run
   git-annex. In this case, that's all files, since you're running it
   in m1, which has no files, and is set to manual mode.

Combining criterion 1 and criterion 2, the command finds file3.
Not that you expected, but only I think because you misunderstood 
what --in does.

So, I don't see a bug here?
