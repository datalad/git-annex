This might not be a very helpful comment, but a while ago I also had a situation where files would be dropped from a remote manual repo.

Unfortunately, I was not able to get this to happen reliably, but from memory

(on repo 1)

    git annex get file --from repo2

would result in ``file`` being gotten, and then dropped, from repo2, even though both repos were set to manual.

But, the unhelpful part, is I can't even remember exactly when this happened (maybe a year ago), so this might not help narrow it down.
