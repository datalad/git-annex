Well, you've provided some great information, and your setup seems sane,
and I'd expect it to keep the file in manual mode and not drop it.

The key part of the log is this:

	[2014-11-16 15:10:23 MSK] dropped random_1_24 (from here) (copies now 2) : drop wanted after Upload UUID \"d865391b-cf21-42d6-a04c-e1b32897c1af\" random_1_24 Nothing

So, after transferring the file to the remote where you're getting it, it
has apparently checked the local repo's preferred content, and thinks it says
that the local repo doesn't want the file anymore. Which certianly doesn't
make sense if the repo is configured to be in manual mode.

The only time I'd expect this to happen is if the file in question is one that
a "client" repository wouldn't normally want. So, if "random_1_24" was in an
archive directory, the preferred content expression would let it drop it then.

I tried to replicate your configuration, and wasn't able to reproduce
it deciding to drop the file, when testing with git-annex version 5.20150618.

Can you reproduce this with the most recent release of git-annex?

If so, can you verify that running "git annex drop --auto" doesn't try to drop any files when you run it 
in the repository that's confgured to be in manual mode?
