### Please describe the problem.

In SmartGit, doing a cherry-pick invokes the following 2 commands.

``git cherry-pick --no-commit <commit-id>``
``git commit "--author='<name and email>'" "--date='<date-time>'" --file=/var/folders/bw/jh4pq43918gfd_r7qxzkkt_40000gq/T/smartgit3129597356340000806tmp/commit7268815197345344355.tmp``

The error is _git 'annex' is not a git command_.


### What steps will reproduce the problem?

``git-annex init <some-name>``

Do some commits in 2 branches.
Do a cherry-pick in SmartGit.


### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?

PLEASE provide instructions here on how to get the git-annex version.
(It is ``git-annex version``. And why is ``git-annex | less`` blanking out when I press any key?)

git-annex: 5.20151019

OS: Mac OS El Capitan.


### Please provide any additional information below.

[[!format sh """
# If you can, paste a complete transcript of the problem occurring here.
# If the problem is with the git-annex assistant, paste in .git/annex/daemon.log


# End of transcript or log.

### Have you had any luck using git-annex before? (Sometimes we get tired of reading bug reports all day and a lil' positive end note does wonders)

Yes. Lots. Am an expert at it now.

This can either be a problem with SmartGit, or a problem with the hacks that git-annex puts into a standard git repo.
