Could you please go into some more detail about these two things:

> --create repo (transfer mode) on VPS
> 
> --create shared encryption repo (backup mode) on same VPS

It's not clear to me what kind of repositories these are. Are they bare git repositories? What version of git-annex, if any, is installed on that VPS?

> git-annex whereis $file does not indicate that the files represented as symlinks are located on the Mac OSX clients in question until after files are manually retrieved

Well, I'd not expect whereis to say that the file is in a repository until it's retrieved into that repository. However, does whereis, on the OSX clients, ever say that the file has reached one of the repos on the VPS?
