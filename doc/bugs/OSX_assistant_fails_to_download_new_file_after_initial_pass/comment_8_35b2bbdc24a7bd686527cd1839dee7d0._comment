Hmm, it looks to me like the transfer scan may not be getting run after the git branches get pulled. I would expect to see \"starting scan of\" in the debug log when it does that scan. Do you see that in the log?

AIUI, when you click on Actions -> Sync Now in the webapp for the repository that contains the content, it gets downloaded right? That does the same scan that should be automatically run after a branch is pulled.
