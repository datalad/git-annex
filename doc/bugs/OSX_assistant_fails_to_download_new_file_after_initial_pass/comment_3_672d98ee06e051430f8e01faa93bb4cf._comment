I created an local repository on each of 2 OS X (10.8.5) systems running git-annex version 5.20140421, and each of 2 Ubuntu 12.04 systems running version 5.20140517.4

I then created a remote SSH repository by selecting \"Make an unencrypted git repository on the server\" - this repo is in \"transfer\" mode.

On the 2nd OSX client, I added a remote SSH repository, providing the same host and path information and elected to \"combine\" my local repo with the remote repo so that files would stay in sync.

I did the same on each of the linux clients.

git-annex indicates that local repos on each machine are in direct mode and show all expected semi trusted repos: web, SSH remote, other clients that have combined with the SSH remote.

git-annex indicates that the SSH remote repo is in indirect mode

git indicates that all repos are in bare mode

git-annex version 5.20140412ubuntu1 is installed on the VPS, and 'git-annex shell notify changes' processes are running.

Agreed on the behavior of git-annex whereisâ€¦ just pointing out that the location info is accurate.

The 2nd, encrypted repo may have no bearing at all because even when I remove it, the client behavior on OSX doesn't change.

Thanks for taking the time to consider this!
