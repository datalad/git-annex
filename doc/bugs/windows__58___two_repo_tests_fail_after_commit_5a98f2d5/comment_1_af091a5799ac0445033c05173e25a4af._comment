Thanks for another fine bug report.

I took a look at that commit, and it seems that reverting it for Windows
makes the most sense. There were two places where it changed behavior on
Windows, that were both separated from the code paths for other OS's.

I've made that change, which should fix it. I'm going to close this bug
report, but please follow up if you still see the issue.

(Also, I've opened [[tasty_test_limiting_broken_by_concurrency]]
