### Please describe the problem.

git-annex version: 6.20160126

Problem happens on Mavericks, not on Yosemite with same version.

Can do a relative or absolute path on a git annex add.

But on the git annex copy to an S3 remote, if I use an absolute path for the file descriptor (e.g. /Users/name/git_directory/test.txt) it will not report an error, but will also not print the "copied..." string. A subsequent call with a relative path (e.g. test.txt) will work, show the copied message and indeed show up on S3.


Good news: It's working great on Yosemite!
