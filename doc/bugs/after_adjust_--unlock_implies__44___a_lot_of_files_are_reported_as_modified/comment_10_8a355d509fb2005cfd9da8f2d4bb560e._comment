Well, I can confirm that, with .git/info/attributes missing, `git status`
displays unlocked files as modified.

But, the bug originally reported here had the files only start to show up
as modified after some amount of time, not immediately. And also, it had
`git diff --cached` outputting nothing when run on those files. The
behavior with .git/info/attributes does not match either of those. So I
don't think yours is the same problem as the original bug report. Which
it's pretty clear involved sshfs.

As to how .git/info/attributes could be missing:
It is created by `git-annex init`. Upgrading a repository from v5 or older
will also create it. So I don't see how it could normally be missing. At the
moment the most likely reason would be if you had deleted it earlier..

(One other way it can be missing is if annex.supportunlocked is set to
false.)
