You have to `git-annex sync` (or `push`) first to get your changes
propagated from the adjusted branch to the main branch that you are
exporting.

(You could alternatively export the adjusted branch itself.)

This is the same as if you tried `git push main origin` when on an adjusted
branch. It would surely not be a bug that doesn't push changes you have
only committed to the adjusted branch. So I think it's reasonable for the
export workflow to need the same step that the git push workflow needs.
