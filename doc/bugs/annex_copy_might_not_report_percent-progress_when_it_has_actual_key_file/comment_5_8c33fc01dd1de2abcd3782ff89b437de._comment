I don't understand what you mean with the find command. Are you talking
about the "unknown" values in the json?

Oh, I suppose you mean particularly that the bytesize is unknown.

Well, this would make `find` output differ depending on whether the key is
present or not, in cases where it would otherwise be the same. And it would
change machine-consumable output in a way that for all I know would break
stuff.

So, changing that seems like a bad idea.
