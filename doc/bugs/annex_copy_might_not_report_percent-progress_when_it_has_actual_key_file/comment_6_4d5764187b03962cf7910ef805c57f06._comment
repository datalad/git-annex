I'd be more comfortable with adding a new "disksize" value
with the current space taken up by the key.

However, adding that to find --json would mean that find would have to stat
the file to get its size, which would slow it down. Find often does already
stat the file via its inAnnex check, but eg `git annex find --in remote` does
not, and slowing that down further seems inadvisable.
