Messages.Progress.metered is what looks at the keySize, and when it's
not known, displays no meter. So it would need an additional Maybe FilePath
that's the file being uploaded, to look at when the keySize is not known.

That does not seem too hard a change to make; I'm not convinced the extra
complexity is worth it, since this would only add progress for uploads,
and not for downloads.

There is something to be said for consistency;
and if some transfers of a key have progress and others do not,
it seems the user might get confused, while if nothing does, the user
can conclude that git-annex is not able to provide progress for a key
that does not contain a size, and if they don't like that, avoid
things that generate such keys.
