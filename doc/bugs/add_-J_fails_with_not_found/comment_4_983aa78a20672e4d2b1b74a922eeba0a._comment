I was worried there could be further races in the seeking
done by withFilesOldUnlocked and withFilesMaybeModified if those
run while files are still being ingested by actions run earlier
in the `git annex add`. Seems this is not a problem though --

withFilesOldUnlocked looks for typeChanged files, but the files
that were just/are currently being added were not in git before,
so are not typeChanged.

withFilesMaybeModified looks for modified files, and again these
files were/are just being added for the first time, so it won't stumble
over them.

So, I don't think a synchronization point is needed. In fact,
all three seeks could actually be run more concurrently than they are not
without stepping on one-another's toes.
