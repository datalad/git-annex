That leaves only the innefficiency of checkFileOrDirectoryExists being
run three times per parameter passed to `git annex add`.

There are some other commands that also run checkFileOrDirectoryExists
multiple times. `git annex lock` being one.

So, I factored that out into a separate pass, that's only done once.
