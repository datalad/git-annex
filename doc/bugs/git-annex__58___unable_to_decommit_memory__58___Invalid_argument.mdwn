### Please describe the problem.

Received the following error upon syncing a large repo.

    git-annex: unable to decommit memory: Invalid argument

### What steps will reproduce the problem?

Not sure. I tried creating a small test repo, adding files, and syncing, but it did not produce the error.

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?

    git-annex version: 6.20161211+gitgc3ab3c6-1~ndall+1

... via the neurodebian repo. On Xubuntu 14.04 64x

    uname -r: 3.13.0-106-generic

### Please provide any additional information below.

My files appear to be okay, and otherwise the annex seems to be functioning normally.

Nonetheless I'm hesitant to use it while this error occurs. Is safe to keep using my annex in spite of the error?

### Have you had any luck using git-annex before? (Sometimes we get tired of reading bug reports all day and a lil' positive end note does wonders)

I've been using git-annex for at least a year now. It's one of the greatest tools I've ever found, and is indispensable for some of my work. I can't recall any other problems I've had that weren't user-caused. So thank you!
