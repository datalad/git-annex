I agreee it makes sense to detect freeze/thaw hook fail at init and error
out rather than switching to an adjusted branch, and rather than start
using a repisitory that is not configured as desired from the start. 
I've implemented that now.

I think that change is arguably enough to consider this done. It avoids
the user initializing a broken repository, or otherwise starting from an
unexpected state. Fixing problems that happen later is the
job of `git-annex fsck`.
