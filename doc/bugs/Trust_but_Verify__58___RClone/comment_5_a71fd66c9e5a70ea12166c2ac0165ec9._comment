Hi D,

That is correct: I am deleting the file via the dropbox sync utility.
What's odd is rclone is aware of the file's absense, so far as `ls` is concerned at least.

I suspect I will recreate your non-issue if I try with the sync utility disabled, I will explore. In the meantime, maybe you can reproduce the issue with the sync utility or have debug command suggestions I could run?
