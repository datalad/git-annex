git-annex drop always actively verifies that a semitrusted remote
still has a copy of the file.

How did you delete the file from the remote? I suppose it's possible that
rclone is seeing a cached or stale state of the dropbox. Or that the
dropbox you deleted it from was not in sync with the dropbox rclone was
looking at.

What version of rclone?

Here's the code that the rclone special remote uses to check the presence
of a file:
<https://github.com/rclone/rclone/blob/master/cmd/gitannex/gitannex.go#L494>

And at least according to the documentation of newObject, that does actively
check if the file is present:
<https://github.com/rclone/rclone/blob/612c717ea0eed3f646095ed57620fd05b2a2c20b/fs/types.go#L36>
