Guess I'll come down on the side of restoring old behavior which was
changed w/o warning (and without the new behavior ever being documented).

And on the side of user experience showing the current behavior is surprising.

The future users who get surprised by the resulting inconsistency 
of unregisterurl not unsetting location tracking will just have to
live with it.. Sigh.
