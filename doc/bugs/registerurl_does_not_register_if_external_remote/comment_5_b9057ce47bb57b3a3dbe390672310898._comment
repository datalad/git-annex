What I'm inclined to do is is add a --remote= parameter to registerurl and
unregisterurl. If the specified remote does not claim the url, have it fail
to add it. (See also [[todo/registerurl_--remote_REMOTE]])

So, you can then use registerurl with --remote=$uuid, check that it
succeeded, and then use setpresentkey to mark it present on that uuid.
Without the fragility you complained of.

Update: The --remote parameter is implemented now.

(Could registerurl with --remote update location tracking itself? Maybe,
but I'd worry about a scenario like in the previous comment.)
