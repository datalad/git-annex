Well, unregisterurl and rmurl can't safely update location tracking for remotes
other than the web. Unless there were some way to know that simply removing an
url was *sufficient*, like it is for the web, and unlike how it would be
with my S3 remote scenario above.

But, the only issue with registerurl updating location tracking is that it's
not symmetric with unregisterurl.

So is that symmetry more important than comment 6? I don't know. In both
cases, some users are going to be surprised by inconsistent behavior.

The only way to avoid all user surprise would be to go back in time and 
make these plumbing commands not update location tracking from the start.
