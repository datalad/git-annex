yet to re-review that reasoning, but does it mean that to merely register a URL client needs to
- call `annex registerurl`
- inspect to which remote URL was added/was claimed (is there a way? `whois` is silent)
- if it was claimed by some special remote other than web -- use `annex setpresentkey`?

Sounds like too much / too fragile, and somewhat different from how `addurl` behaves which does it all just fine regardless either it is web or some claimurl'ed remote.
