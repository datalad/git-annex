That ssh lock file is created by this code:

	-- The posix lock file is created even when using pid locks, in order to
	-- avoid complicating any code that might expect to be able to see that
	-- lock file. But, it's not locked.
	dummyPosixLock :: Maybe FileMode -> LockFile -> IO ()
	dummyPosixLock m f = closeFd =<< openLockFile ReadLock m f

But, that does not ever actually take a lock on the file, so
NFS should not make its .nfs thing in this case. Unless NFS does it when a
FD is simply opened with close-on-exec set. 

Can you get a strace of the creation of files under .git/annex/ssh/
that result in these .nfs things?
