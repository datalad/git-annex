git-annex always registers a cleanup action when it starts using a ssh
connection caching socket. As long as git-annex gets a change to shut down
cleanly (ie is not interrupted), it should run the action to stop the ssh
connection caching.

For example, git-annex sync --debug here shows as its second to last line:

	[2016-04-20 12:47:40.069633] read: ssh ["-O","stop","-S","server","-o","ControlMaster=auto","-o","ControlPersist=yes","server"]
