Re the OSX failure, it seems that somehow the manifest key is not being
found when the test is run on OSX. I don't know why. There is nothing in
this code that should be OSX-specific.

Unfortunately I do have access to any OSX system to try to investigate
this. The "datalads-mac" I used to use does not seem to exist anymore.

Of course, this test could be skipped on OSX.

Does occur to me this could somehow be exposing a deeper problem on OSX
with exporttree special remotes. I have split the failing test in two, so
we'll see if both fail, or only the exporttree one.
