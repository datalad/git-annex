This is a new test.

Looks like it's found a legitimate bug in git-remote-annex. When the
filesystem is crippled, the git-annex init checks out an adjusted branch,
which here happens in the middle of git's own checkout and so legitimately
confuses git.

I can reproduce this on a FAT filesystem, cloning from eg a directory
special remote. Fixed this.

(The OSX failure is something else.)
