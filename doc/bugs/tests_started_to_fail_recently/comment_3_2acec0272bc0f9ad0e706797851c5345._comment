Aha, this test on ubuntu is failing the same way as the OSX test:

<https://github.com/datalad/git-annex/actions/runs/11905453897/job/33176247387>

It seems that "custom-config1" only involves a annex.stalldetection
setting, if I am reading the workflow file right. I was not able to
reproduce the failure with that config set though.
