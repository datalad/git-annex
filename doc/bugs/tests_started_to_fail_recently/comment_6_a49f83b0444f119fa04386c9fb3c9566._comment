And here's why it's failing still on OSX and that 1 ubuntu "custom-config1" run:

	git clone from special remote (after git push with output: Full remote url: annex::89ddefa4-a04c-11ef-87b5-e880882a4f98?encryption=none&type=directory
	git-annex: remote url not configured
	Push failed (Failed to upload GITBUNDLE-s3832--89ddefa4-a04c-11ef-87b5-e880882a4f98-b73a51289d659d73054ee531b45825da3061213d32d47aeb998f4abeb591a88d)
	warning: helper reported unexpected status of push
	warning: helper reported unexpected status of push
  	Everything up-to-date

Fascinating. It seems that git-remote-annex has been run twice. The first time
seemed to do something successfully, since it reported the "Full remote url".
Probably that first run is git using it to see what refs are on the remote. 

The second time, git ran git-remote-annex with only 1 argument, rather than the
expected 2. Why would git do that? And only in these few situations?

According to gitremote-helpers:

       Additionally, when a configured remote has remote.<name>.vcs set to <transport>, Git explicitly invokes git remote-<transport>
       with <name> as the first argument. If set, the second argument is remote.<name>.url; otherwise, the second argument is omitted.

But that does not apply. The docs don't seem to give any other reason why
the second argument would be omitted. Although the docs do say it's optional.

I've improved git-remote-annex output in this situation, so it will show
wha the first parameter is. That might help understand out what git is trying to
do here.
