My arm64-ancient build failed today in the same way as the OSX build is failing,
so I should be able to debug it there.

	builder@sparrow:~/x/a$ git push d git-annex
	Full remote url: annex::f88d4965-fc4f-4dd0-aac2-eaf19c9bcfa5?encryption=none&type=directory
	fatal: Refusing to create empty bundle.
	Push failed (user error (git ["--git-dir=.git","--work-tree=.","--literal-pathspecs","bundle","create","--quiet","/tmp/GITBUNDLE1049637-0","--stdin"] exited 128))
	warning: helper reported unexpected status of push
	Everything up-to-date
	builder@sparrow:~/x/a$ echo $?
	0

Huh ok, so git-remote-annex is failing to push, which is why clone
later fails. And for whatever reason git doesn't propigate the error, which
is why this is not visible in the transcript.

That build uses git 2.30.2. That git bundle --stdin was broken and
didn't read refs from stdin at all. Also it had other bugs. I think it's
best not to try to support git-remote-annex with that version of git at
all, given those bugs.

That probably won't help with the OSX failure, which is with a very new git
version. So I also made the test
suite capture the git push output even when it exits successfully, so it
can display it when the git pull fails. That should show what the problem
is there.
