	git-annex: remote url not configured for transferrer

Apparently git is running "git-remote-annex transferrer".

This must be due to git-remote-annex be running "$0 transferrer" instead
of "git-annex transferrer"!

In the usual case, when git-remote-annex is a symlink to git-annex,
getExecutablePath returns "git-annex". But, if git-remote-annex is a
hardlink or copy, that returns "git-remote-annex" instead.

And in the linux standalone tarball and OSX app, it does not use
getExecutablePath, but getProgName so "git-remote-annex" also there.
