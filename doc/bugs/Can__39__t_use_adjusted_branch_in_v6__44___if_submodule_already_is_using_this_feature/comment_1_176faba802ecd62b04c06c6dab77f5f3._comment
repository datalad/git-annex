Error message is:

	git-annex: unexpected object type "comm"

What it's actually choking on is the "commit" object for the submodule,
in git-ls-tree output. Doesn't matter if the submodule uses
adjusted branches or not.

The parser for ls-tree output is buggy;
it's expecting only "blob" and "tree", so pulls out a fixed width 4
characters: "comm"

Also, the adjusted branch code needs to be made to skip over CommitObjects,
once the parser is fixed to generate them.
