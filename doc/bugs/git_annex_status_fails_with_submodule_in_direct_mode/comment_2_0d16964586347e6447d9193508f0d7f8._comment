Yes, that's what I assumed. Therefore this bug was linked in the datalad issue regarding --ignore-submodules.

May be we are the only ones, who are actually effected, since we heavily use submodules. If it's too much of an effort, I will find a way around it, I guess.
Either way: Thank you for having a look at it.
