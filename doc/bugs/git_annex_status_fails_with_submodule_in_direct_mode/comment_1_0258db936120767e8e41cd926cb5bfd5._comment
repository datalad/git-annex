Error is:

	fatal: This operation must be run in a work tree
	fatal: 'git status --porcelain' failed in submodule sub

`git status` fails the same way, and it seems that the only way
to make it work would be to pass --ignore-submodules to it.

But I suppose then, it would need to replicate git status's submodule
traversal.

I'm not too keen on adding complicated stuff involving submodules to direct
mode. My goal with direct mode is to eliminate the need for it.
