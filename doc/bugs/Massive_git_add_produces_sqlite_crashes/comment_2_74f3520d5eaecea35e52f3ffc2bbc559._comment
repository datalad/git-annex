Hello joey, and thanks for the quick answer, I am honored !
It's refreshing to enter an active community :)

About the usage of \"bash on Windows\", well, git-annex had too many problems, especially with the symlinks, until the recent \"Windows 10 Fall Creators Update\".
Now it goes pretty well.

My main concern for the moment is the symlinks created in the \"bash\" can't be used by windows whereas symlinks created in windows can be used in \"bash\".
Thus working in an annexed directory with Windows programs needs to unlock files. One note though, I didn't try with hardlinks.

About the v6. I just figured that some minutes ago and, following <http://git-annex.branchable.com/tips/largefiles/>, created a .gitattributes file.

	*.txt annex.largefiles=nothing

It works better now.

About the smudge/sqlite errors. I encountered those only after a big number of adds.
I even managed to add all my files eventually with a little loop ignoring the errors (for 1000 files):

	for i in {1..10}
	do 
	git add $(git ls-files --others | grep txt | head -100) 2> /dev/null
	done
