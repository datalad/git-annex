Hmm, I guess this wasn't implemented because a generally small number of
hash directories are not a bother. And because implementing it was a bit
annoying.

Testremote cannot test for this, because remotes do not need to have the
concept of a "directory". For example, a S3 bucket does not contain
directories, only filenames that may contain a "/" in them. Also, I don't
think it's necessarily a bug for a special remote to leave hash directories
in place when removing files. There could be good reasons to do that in
some cases.
