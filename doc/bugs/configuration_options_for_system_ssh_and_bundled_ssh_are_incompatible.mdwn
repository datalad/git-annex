### Please describe the problem.

It appears that the bundled ssh is built without support for some configuration options supported by my system ssh. In particular it doesn't support GSSAPIKexAlgorithms. In principle it's fine to compile this ssh without support for GSS, since nobody uses it, but in practice it means that I can't even turn it off in my system config without breaking the bundled ssh.

(I suppose the problem could also be that the bundled ssh tries to use the system ssh configuration instead of a bundled configuration.)

### Have you had any luck using git-annex before? (Sometimes we get tired of reading bug reports all day and a lil' positive end note does wonders)
