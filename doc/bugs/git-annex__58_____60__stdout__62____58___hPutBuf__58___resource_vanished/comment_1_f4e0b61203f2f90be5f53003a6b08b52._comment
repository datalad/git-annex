I've seen this message before with `git-annex version | head -n 1`

That particular one was made to ignore the error to write to stdout after
it was closed, but any other write to stdout might fail similarly when
going to a pipe that got closed.

So can you please track down what git-annex command is being run? My
suggestion is to use `strace -f`
