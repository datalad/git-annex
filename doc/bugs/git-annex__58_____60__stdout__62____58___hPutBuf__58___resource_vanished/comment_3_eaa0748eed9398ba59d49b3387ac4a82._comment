Thank you @joey and @mak for the hints.
I was unable (even with strace) for chase down the particular system call that cause the issue, since it is highly random and generated by my shell prompt.
However, mak seems right about the git_status module of starship. I increased my timeout from 500ms (default) to 1000ms (and will try slightly larger value if needed).
If this mitigate the issue correctly, I will not comment anymore! But I suspect it to work. ;)
