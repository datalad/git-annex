I arrived here because I was having the same issue. At least in my case, the issue seems to stem from the `git_status` module in starship. I know this is not the best solution, but I was able to stop this issue by increasing the value of `command_timeout` in my starship config. Another potential solution might be to use `gitoxide` for checking the status of the repository with starship (my assumption here is that `gitoxide` might be faster than regular git for checking the status of the repository).
