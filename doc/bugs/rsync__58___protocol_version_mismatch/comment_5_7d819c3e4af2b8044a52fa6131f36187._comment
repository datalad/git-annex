The stray recv-key is a good clue. git-annex-shell only allows one upload
of a given file to run at a time. So if you get a transfer stalled out,
it will reject another transfer attempt. This can sometimes happen when eg,
migrating between networks and restarting an upload when the old one is
still running on the server.

However, normally there is an error message "transfer already in progress".

It may be that your rsync is not forwarding that stderr through to display
it, for some reason.

It would probably help if you can run the same git-annex shell command line
on the server, verify that it fails with "transfer already in progress"
when an recvkey of that key is already running. Then you could try sshing
to the server noninteractively and having it run the same git-annex-shell
command, and see if the error makes it through that.
