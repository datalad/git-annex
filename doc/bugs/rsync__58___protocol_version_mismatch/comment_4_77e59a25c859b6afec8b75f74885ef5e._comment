Hm, not so sure that \"rebooted, did not help\" was actually true. I take that back.

Now I saw a stray `git-annex-shell recv-key` process mentioning that file. I killed it and now everything seems fine. I will keep this in mind for next time, to see if I can verify that this was actually the cause of the message, but maybe it's a clue.
