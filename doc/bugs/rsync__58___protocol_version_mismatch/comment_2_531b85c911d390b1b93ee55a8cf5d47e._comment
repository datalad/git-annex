It's weirder than that. I add a cow union mount over it, it works fine.

I copy the file, I drop the file, I remove the union mount. Again it's back in the broken state. Rebooting does not help, so it's not some very insistent lock.

Next I will try a copy of the repo, to see if that is able to carry over whatever strange state this thing is in.
