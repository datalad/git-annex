ikiwiki gets slow the more pages it has to deal with. With only a few
thousand pages, it's pretty fast. Including comments, there are currently 
nearly 10k pages here. (The server might also have been overloaded
for some reason when this bug was filed. There were some stability problems
in august related to apache bugs.)

In the past I've deleted old closed bugs to speed it back up.
There around 3k pages in bugs and todo including comments.

Deleted bugs closed before this year and removed almost 1k pages.

Also, needing to update the rss and atom feeds when adding a bug
meant writing over 10 mb to disk every time. Limited the size of those
feeds, which should help a lot.
