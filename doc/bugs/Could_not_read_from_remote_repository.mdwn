### Please describe the problem.

I've been using git-annex for a few weeks now, and everything was working fine until today. Now, when git-annex goes to sync my files, it will hang for a while, and then display a red box on the left side, saying `! Synced with adam.liter`. So, basically, it doesn't really sync. The logs say that it cannot read from the remote repository, which is set up on box.com and was working just fine until today.

I've tried reconfiguring my jabber account on all my devices with git-annex as well as deleting and remaking the box.com repository, and none of these steps have solved the problem.

### What steps will reproduce the problem?

Making changes to any file located in the repository.

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?

Mac OS X 10.8.4 and git-annex version 4.20130801-gc88bbc4.

### Please provide any additional information below.
