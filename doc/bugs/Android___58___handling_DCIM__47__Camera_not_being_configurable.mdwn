### Please describe the problem.

In order to handle the fact that the directory where pictures are saved is not configurable on my phone, I set up a second git annex repository with the Repository group "file source".

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?

5.20140108-gce9652

### Please provide any additional information below.

In the log, there are many "too many open files" errors like these :

git:createProcess: runInteractiveProcess: pipe: resource exhausted (Too many open files)

[[!tag moreinfo]]
[[!meta title="too many open files on android"]]
