This behaviour is indeed very confusing when one attempts to use git-annex with the assistant only, without thinking about the underlying machinery.
Having the assistant automatically put a .gitignore file in empty directories is a possible solution, but maybe printing a warning in the log when the watcher sees an empty directory could be an unobtrusive and helpful solution? (At least it would have helped me)
