Adding .gitignore files makes sense for a git standpoint but whatever workaround is needed to make the assistant works properly should be done by the assistant itself no? Maybe having direct mode commit a shaddow \".this_is_a_magic_empty_file\" in empty directories and then not actually writing that file into direct mode repositories on the other side.
