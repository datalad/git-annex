Your hypothesis is right, it's items in the bucket with names ending in "/".

After fixing git-annex to skip and warn about those, it looks like this:

	list s3-origin
	  Cannot import a file with a name that appears to be a directory: models/smartspim_production_models/
	
	  Cannot import a file with a name that appears to be a directory: models/smartspim_production_models/model_2_12202024/
	
	  Cannot import a file with a name that appears to be a directory: point_annotations/
	
	  Cannot import a file with a name that appears to be a directory: point_annotations/06-21-2024/
	ok

Note that "models/smartspim_production_models/config.json" is a file in the
bucket located "inside" the first path. So this is not a case of an empty
directory being somehow stored to a S3 bucket as a file, but of something else.
I have not looked at the contents of these objects, as I would likely not
understand them anyway.

I couldn't think of a better method than to warn and skip them. Any name mangling
would take a name that could be used by some other file. And not warning risks the user
being surprised when all the data in the bucket does not get imported.
