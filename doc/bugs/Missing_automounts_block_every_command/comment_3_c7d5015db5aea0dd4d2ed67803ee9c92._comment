There would still be some cases where a git-annex command blocks somewhat
unexpectedly on the automount. 

For one, `git annex drop` can need to
check if content is in a remote, and so would block, despite not acting
directly on that remote. 

And, `git annex get` of a file that's located in
such an locally automounted remote and a network remote will
default to trying the local remote first, and so would block.

The cost of the automounted remote could be adjusted to make these commands
prefer some other remote, but then you've configured git-annex to not
use the automounted remote much, which is probably not what you really want
to do if it's a fast drive.

Of course, there are also ways to automount removable drives when they get
plugged in, rather than using automounts that block on access, and so
neatly avoid all blocking problems.
