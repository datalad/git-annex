Added remote.<name>.annex-checkuuid config, which can be set to false
to disable the default checking of the uuid. It will still check before
making any modification of the remote repository.

There may still be situations where using this kind of automount is suboptimal
with git-annex, as outlined in comment 3, but I think this is as far as it makes
sense to change git-annex to deal with them.
