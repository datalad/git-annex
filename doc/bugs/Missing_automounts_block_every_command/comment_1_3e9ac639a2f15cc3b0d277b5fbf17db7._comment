There are a couple of parts to this, so let's get this one out of the way
first: Tab completion etc should not be looking at remotes.

It seems that even `git annex --help` does for some reason; so does
stuff like `git annex examinekey`. So it's happening in a core code-path.

Ah, ok.. Git.Config.read uses Git.Construct.fromRemotes,
which uses Git.Construct.fromAbsPath, which stats
the remote directory to handle ".git" canonicalization.

Fixed this part of it; now only when the remoteList is built does it
stat remotes.
