@lell, would you be so kind to point to me to \"formalization\" you use for your containers/configuration layout?
\"I like containers too\", and in neuro* domain we are formalizing layout of data etc on the filesystem in [BIDS standard](https://bids.neuroimaging.io/).
Moreover we are trying to formalize at the level of the \"entire project\", see e.g. [this issue with examples](https://github.com/bids-standard/bids-specification/pull/1861#issuecomment-2183701293).
I would be interested to learn what/how you do it.
Feel welcome to reach out directly to e.g. `debian AT oneukrainian.com`.
Cheers,
"""]]
