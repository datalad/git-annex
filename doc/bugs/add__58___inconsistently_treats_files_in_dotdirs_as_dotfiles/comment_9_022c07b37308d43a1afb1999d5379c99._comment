(Note that this is a bug that has already been closed.)

While yes, leading dot just means "hide it from ls", people *do* have a
legitimate complaint when `git-annex add` annexes .gitattributes or a file
like that. Since we don't have any other general semantic information about
config files besides leading dot, this seems to be to be the best that can
be done to avoid what would otherwise be a common complaint, and turn it
into an uncommon complaint.

The only other good approach seems to be the git-lfs approach, of requiring
that the user configure explicitly which files they consider large, with eg
`git lfs track "*.iso"`
