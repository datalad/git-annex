I did spend some time now trying to figure FTW and why git-annex (version from end of last year) says \"non-large file; adding content to git repository\" whenever `check-attr` insists that `largefile` should apply to my huge `.dandi/assets.json`.  Only trying newer git-annex I think I got the reason which it finally announced as \"dotfile; adding content to git repository\" and I was able to recover this discussion!

Re 

> But, .config/ seems to me to perfectly match what dotfiles are, which is files that are configuration that are named with a name starting with a dot in order to keep them from cluttering up ls. 

As far as I know, having leading dot just a convention for **hidden** and not config, and even not neccessarily text files. 
Even though, `dotfile` files (not folders) are most of the time are text files, I would not generalize that to dot-folders:
content of `.cache/` or `.venv/` (created by `uv`) etc are unlikely to be text files to even start with.  Those folder names start with dot to signal \"hidden\" not \"text\" or \"small\".

That is why I retain that it remains confusing and inconsistent to have any special treatment and need for extra configuration (`git annex config --set annex.dotfiles true`) for content of dot-folders.  I appreciate that such change would likely change behavior but IMHO it might just be \"for the best\".
