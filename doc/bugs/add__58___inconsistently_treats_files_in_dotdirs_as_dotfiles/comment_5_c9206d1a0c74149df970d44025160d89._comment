> Why can't git-annex just handle the .git folder differently and for all others just annex or not as set in the largefile rules?

Because creating a .gitignore followed by `git-annex add` would then blow the
user's foot off. And this would be a very common foot-shooting opportunity,
and .gitignore is only the perhaps most common trigger for it.

Files in dot directories are generally less common, outside of course of
.git and $HOME. Which is the only reason I'm willing to consider changing
the dotfiles handling to not include those.

But, .config/ seems to me to perfectly match what dotfiles *are*, which is
files that are configuration that are named with a name starting with a
dot in order to keep them from cluttering up `ls`. Just because in your use
case you don't want to check those into git as dotfiles does not seem like
a good argument for git-annex to not treat them as dotfiles by default.
