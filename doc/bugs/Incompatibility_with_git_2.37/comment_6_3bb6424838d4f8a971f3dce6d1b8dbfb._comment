Now 2 weeks since the segfault in git has been known, and they have not
fixed it.

Now feeling that it's might be worth git-annex init avoiding the
segfault, by making sure to do something that creates the index file before
write-tree. So I don't have to worry about when this gets fixed in git,
or the chances that a buggy release will start being widely used for a long
time.

Yeah, done so.
