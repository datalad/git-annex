`git write-tree` has always locked the index, so it seems something else
has changed to also lock the index when core.untrackedCache is set, that
did not before.

Probably `git update-index`, since that's what looks at the config.
`git-annex init` does run that, before `git write-tree`, but it
waits for it to exit. So I don't understand what would have the index still
locked.

I wonder if this is related to some other config also being set, such as
core.fsmonitor.
