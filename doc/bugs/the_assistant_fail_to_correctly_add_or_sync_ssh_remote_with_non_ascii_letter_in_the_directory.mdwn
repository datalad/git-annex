### Please describe the problem.
I've tried to setup a remote using assistant, but it failed to correctly sync apparently because there is a "è" in the directory

### What steps will reproduce the problem?
run the webapp
use "Add another directory"
then Remote Server
add host name, user name password and directory as "Bibliothèque calibre" (to a repository that already exists)

the remote is added as metadata only and the assistant will try to upload every file to it every time it is restarted.

if a symlink is created named "calibre library", and is used instead, there is no problem.

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?
it is git-annex version: 5.20150916-1 on debian/sid

### Please provide any additional information below.

the log is full of:

### Have you had any luck using git-annex before? (Sometimes we get tired of reading bug reports all day and a lil' positive end note does wonders)

Adding remote that use only ascii letter work realy well with the webapp.
