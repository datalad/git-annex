### Please describe the problem.
I could not find a way to abort the addition of a new remote repository.

### What steps will reproduce the problem?
- start adding a remote repository (unencrypted, with git-annex installed);
- forget to create the folder on the remote host;
- navigate away from the repository page;
- the dashboard says the repository is partially set-up, and the only thing one can do is look at the log (which says the folder is missing).

I was able to solve it by creating another repository with the exact same data.

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?

Version: 4.20131002-gf25991c on OS X 10.8.5

### Please provide any additional information below.

# End of transcript or log.
