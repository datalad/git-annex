### Please describe the problem.

I am having a problem on Windows in which the AWS access credentials are stored but not used. When I have the ```AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID``` and ```AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY``` variables are set, everything works correctly. However if I open a new window that doesn't have envs set, git annex sync --content fails with a Forbidden message. Looking in the creds directory, I see plaintext creds stored.

### What steps will reproduce the problem?

```
# set AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=thing1
# set AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=thing2
# git init test
# cd test
# git annex init
# git annex initremote s3cloud type=S3 encryption=pubkey keyid=key embedcreds=yes
 ... everything works, annex-uuid is created, etc ...

# now open a new window, navigate to proper repo

# git annex sync --content

... forbidden messages

# Reset the env vars
... sync works as normal ...
```

Note that this fails *silently* when using the webapp. The app shows percentage of upload, and the uploads "complete" but the log shows:

```
  S3Error {s3StatusCode = Status {statusCode = 403, statusMessage = "Forbidden"}, s3ErrorCode = "InvalidAccessKeyId", s3ErrorMessage = "The AWS Access Key Id you provided does not exist in our records.", s3ErrorResource = Nothing, s3ErrorHostId = Just "/MfOhrvmoi1uTsuJDaV2c+3jxqt+/cAC8KBvGkbE+os1BAPAw/bLeNHiUF8kbSJ+2cMuNO+0mzQ=", s3ErrorAccessKeyId = Just "redacted", s3ErrorStringToSign = Nothing, s3ErrorBucket = Nothing, s3ErrorEndpointRaw = Nothing, s3ErrorEndpoint = Nothing}
```

### Have you had any luck using git-annex before? (Sometimes we get tired of reading bug reports all day and a lil' positive end note does wonders)

I have successfully used git annex on linux and mac, and it is great!
