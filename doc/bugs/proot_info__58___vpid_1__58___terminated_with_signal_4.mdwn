### Please describe the problem.
I get this error when I try to run git annex sync on my amazon fire tablet.
`proot info: vpid 1: terminated with signal 4`

`uname -m` reports `armv7l`

If I do `proot-distro login debian` then I can use the very same git-annex.linux and it works but it's slow (idk why). If I try to use git annex from termux then it fails with that error. Not that it matters, I'm using termux from here https://sourceforge.net/projects/android-ports-for-gnu-emacs/files/termux/ which is "a version of the Termux terminal emulator signed with
Emacs's signing keys" so that Emacs can use the termux binaries or something.
 
### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?
Android 9. LineageOS.

### Have you had any luck using git-annex before? (Sometimes we get tired of reading bug reports all day and a lil' positive end note does wonders)

So, I've been trying to uss it for years. Kind of like how I tried using Emacs and went bankrupt twice before things clicked. I was so hung up on the symlinks. Then I finally understood some things, thanks Gemini, and now I'm using annex.addunlocked and annex.thin and I feel really nerdy and cool. I would love to get this working on my tablet too.

Thanks!
