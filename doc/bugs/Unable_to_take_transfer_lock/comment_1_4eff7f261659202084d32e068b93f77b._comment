The most likely reason for that error message would be if a transfer
of the same file was already in progress by another git-annex process.

It might also be the case that if you're trying to access a git-annex
repository via SMB, the POSIX fcntl locking that git-annex needs to do
don't work. This is often the case with various network filesystems.
Solution is to make the url for the git remote be a ssh:// url instead.

I don't know what OSX's case-insensative complication could have to do with
this, although it certianly seems to be a good way to get completely
unexpected behavior.

Is there an actual bug here? What are the steps to reproduce
it?
