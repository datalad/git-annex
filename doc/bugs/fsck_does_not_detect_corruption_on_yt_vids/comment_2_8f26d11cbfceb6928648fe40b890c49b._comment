The intent of this is to allow downloading the same youtube video to
multiple devices, since youtube might present different encodings of the
video at different times.

You can use `git-annex migrate --backend=SHA256` to convert to a backend
that does get hash checked.

If you set the annex.securehashesonly config to true, `git-annex fsck`
will complain about any files that are not hashed (as well as files using
insecure hashes).

Setting annex.securehashesonly will also prevent `git-annex addurl` from
adding youtube videos, eg:

	git-annex addurl 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uA3yPe5lG4c'
	addurl https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uA3yPe5lG4c
	(using yt-dlp)
	  annex.securehashesonly blocked transfer of URL key
	failed

Perhaps it would be better for addurl, with that configuration, to
not generate an URL key, but hash it with the default backend.
