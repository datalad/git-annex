I think I found a likely explanation: The yt-dlp downloaded videos use the URL backend, which doesn't include any sort of hashing. That makes some sense, but the indicator that `git annex fsck` gives here is still misleading. You might have silent corruption without realizing it, which is never something I'd anticipate with files stored in a git repo.

Should `git annex fsck` perhaps print a warning of some type when checking files it cannot verify consistency on?
