>git-annex import and the directory special remote should skip over symlinks

It should still import them as symlinks into git, just not change them to annexed files.  If these are relative symlinks pointing within the tree being imported, they'll still work in the repo.  If these are absolute symlinks to common files mounted on a filesystem shared by all users of the repo, you still want them in the imported repo as absolute symlinks.  Absolute symlinks that happen to point within the tree being imported should be imported as annexed files.
