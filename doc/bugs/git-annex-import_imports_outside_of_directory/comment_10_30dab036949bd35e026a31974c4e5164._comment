> the old git-annex import already skipped symlinks to files

Then the old import was problematic as well :)

Sorry for harping on this, but since this affects my use cases (and I suspect others' as well), what's the rationale for not doing what `tar` does?
I assumed that an import is similar to doing a `tar` or a `cp -pr`, except that the files get annexed and a connection to the files' origin is recorded.

For things like song collections the symlinks might not matter, but for datasets they do.  E.g. symlinks are used to ensure tools that expect certain filenames at certain paths can find them.  The tools are often written by other people, so as a user you might not know all details of these expectations.  Files from related analyses are symlinked to keep the relation explicit.
Absolute symlinks are used to point to large shared resources (e.g. genome files) on a filesystem that all users of the repo share.   I can give more detailed illustrations if it would help.  But I'm not sure I understand the downside of importing symlinks the way tar does.
