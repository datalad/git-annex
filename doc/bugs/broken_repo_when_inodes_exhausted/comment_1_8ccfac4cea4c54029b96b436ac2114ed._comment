Pretty much anything is going to break when you run out of inodes; 
all the errors shown here are due to the git repository getting
inconsistent because of it. I don't see any part that's git-annex specific.

Is `git annex repair` able to repair it at all? I'd expect it would be able
to, as long as `git fsck` reports that there are problems.
