Thanks.  It turns out I'd deleted that repo in order to free the inodes up.  Next time I will see if I can repair.

But it would be nice if git-annex tracked inodes the way it tracks free space, so that it could refrain from causing the inode exhaustion.  This also would have alerted me to how few inodes I had remaining.
