The problem is much simpler than that: Files that are unlocked in v6
repositories are not treated as annexed files at all in v5 repositories.
You cannot `git annex get` them or anything. 

So, the simpler reproduction recipe is to `git add` a file to a v6
repository and then in a v5 clone, `git annex get` and it won't say
anything, because that's not an annexed file as far as it's concerned.

It's also very easy to deal with this situation if you've gotten into it --
all you need to do is `git annex lock` the files in a v6 repository and
commit it, and then the v5 repository will be able to access them.

A good way to avoid the problem while still using the features of v6
in your v6 repository is to run `git annex adjust --unlock` in there.
Then commits of unlocked files will automatically be translated to locked
files that are compatible with v5.

git-annex v5 can't possibly treat v6 unlocked files as annexed files.
It could warn about the problem, but this would complicate it with needing
to check if every non-symlink file is a v6 unlocked file. I don't feel
this problem warrants that complication.
