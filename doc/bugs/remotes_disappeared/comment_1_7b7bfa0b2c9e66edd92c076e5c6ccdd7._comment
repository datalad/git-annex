I see that you're using `reinit` .. so are you sure that the UUID you
reused there or at some other time did not belong to a remote that had
previously been marked dead? 

I mean, reusing UUIDs of dead remotes (or just generally reusing UUIDS at
all) seems like the most obvious way to shoot yourself in the foot and get
into something resembling this sitation.

Your transcript seems to show one git-annex info in the ~/mp3 repository
listing the remotes, and a subsquent git-annex info in the ~/mp3 repository
not listing the remotes, with no commands in between that touch that
repository in any way. This makes me suspect something is being left out
somehow. Are you using the assistant or something?

You can see which remotes have been marked dead by `git show git-annex:trust.log | grep X`
