### Please describe the problem.

I got the following errors from the assistant, in `.git/annex/daemon.log`:

    InternalIOException send: resource vanished (Broken pipe)

Then subsequent transfers seem to fail with:

    InternalIOException send: resource vanished (Connection reset by peer)

### What steps will reproduce the problem?

It's unclear. The assistant is trying to sync a lot of stuff to S3 right now, as files are regularly added into the repository and the assistant migrates them all there. The repository is setup as a "source" repository to make sure it doesn't keep files and send them all to s3.

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?

standalone tarball `5.20150508-g883d57f` on Ubuntu Precise.

### Please provide any additional information below.

here are the two latest log files, but all previous logfiles available are similar...
