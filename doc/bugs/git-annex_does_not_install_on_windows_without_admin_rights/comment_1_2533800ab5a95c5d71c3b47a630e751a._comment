Thanks, this had been reported in the forum before, but they did not point at the directory permissions as the problem.

It would be possible to modify the installer to install git-annex somewhere else and add it to the PATH, but it seems this is a utter nightmare on windows and I'd have to pull in enormous NSIS scripts from their wiki, of unknown provenance. Which is why I am piggybacking on the git installation's PATH.
