This does seem to be an unncessary use of the database,
git-annex init always creates the db in scanUnlockedFiles
when the repo has a HEAD ref, but normally it will find no unlocked files
and so it could just not create the database there.

That should make git-annex usable, until a situation where it does
need to use the database, like something to do with an unlocked file.

Implemented that, which will fix the immediate problem reported here,
but I'd like to pursue the WAL stuff still.
