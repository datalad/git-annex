This is sqlite failing to do its own internal locking which I'll bet is
some elaborate and fine-grained locking indeed.

Essentially the same problem as
[[drop_blows_on_lustre__58___SQLite3_returned_ErrorIO]]
(And also the main problem using git-annex on Windows in WSL.)

Not a great deal I can do about this, because the locking is in sqlite.
That other bug has some thoughts about avoiding unncessary use of sqlite
or moving the databases to some other filesystem.

It may be that not enabling WAL mode on the database would change sqlite's
locking behavior to something that works better on the filesystem.
I would normally not want to do that, but with pidlock enabled, only one
git-annex is going to be running anyway, and so there's no need for WAL
mode's concurrency support.

Here's a patch to test. I would not use this in production, since it does
not check for pidlock, but just always disables WAL.
