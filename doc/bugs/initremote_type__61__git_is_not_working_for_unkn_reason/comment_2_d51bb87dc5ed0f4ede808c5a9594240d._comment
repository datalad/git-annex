Wouldn't it be possible to support (absolute) file:// urls, eg. something similar to
`file:///home/jkniiv/test-VEfBrTZ/remote2`? In my mind they feel like a reasonable approximation
of ssh:// urls and could be useful for getting a feel for git special remotes before setting
up a bare git-repo/annex on an ssh-server. I know they are not the same thing implementation wise
but I feel that being able to try this feature out on a least-effort basis would be useful
from a pedagogical standpoint.
