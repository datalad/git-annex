Hmm, I think this only works for ssh:// urls currently.

Even the ssh url form host:/path does not work, because it gets
normalized to a ssh:// url.

The implementation does not support non-url's at all; the provided location
is treated as an url (`Git.Url location`). And even if it were treated as a
path, the path gets normalized to a relative path and an absolute path (or
differently relavatized path) would not work.

Using paths with this is rather problematic too, because if the repo is
cloned to another machine, it would not find the repo at the recorded path.
Similarly, relative paths are also problimatic. But it may as well support
them to the extent it can.

I think this needs changes to the core Git data structure, to store the
original, unmodified git.remote.path. Or a different interface than the
current, one that accepts any repo location and probes it to find the uuid.
The latter idea seems better because it simplifies the UI rather than
complicating the internal representation.
