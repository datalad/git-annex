What kind of performance benefit are we talking about here?

It seems it would be a bit hard to implement this, since Backend.Hash uses
a HashSize that is just an Int, which would have to be extended with the
number of bits to use of a longer hash. Not hard hard but it will
complicate the code.

(Also, the name "SKEIN512_256" is pretty long itself to include in a
filename.")
