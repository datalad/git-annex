### Please describe the problem.

Setting up a new repo with an existing git-lfs as its only annex remote doesn't find the annex files.

### What steps will reproduce the problem?

This is all with encryption=none

* set up repo w/ lfs-enabled origin.
* annex a file, commit, push.
* set up git-lfs special remote, and git annex copy --to it.

Now

* clone origin.
* set up the same git-lfs special remote.
* oops: git annex get says no available copies!

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?

* Debian GNU/Linux (testing)
* git 1:2.27.0-1
* git-annex 8.20200330-1

### Please provide any additional information below.

# End of transcript or log.

### Have you had any luck using git-annex before? (Sometimes we get tired of reading bug reports all day and a lil' positive end note does wonders)

I use it all the time for lots of files, git-annex is great! Hoping to migrate off my own ancient server to a gitlab one maintained by somebody else, mainly because it's backed up. But would prefer to stick with git-annex instead of having to migrate to horrible git-lfs.
