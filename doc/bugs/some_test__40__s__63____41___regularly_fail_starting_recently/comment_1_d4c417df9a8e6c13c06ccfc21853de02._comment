`ExitFailure (-6)` says something went badly wrong. That is not a specific
test failing, it's an entire test runner crashing. Apparently with SIGABRT,
so something found a reason to `abort()`. git-annex does not do that,
probably it was glibc that did.

Looking in the log...

	2022-12-08T03:13:27.8289753Z libgcc_s.so.1 must be installed for pthread_cancel to work

Oho! Same as [[bugs/standalone_needs_more_depends_-_libgcc-s1__63__]]
then it seems. I've fixed that earlier today, so try with an updated
standalone build.
