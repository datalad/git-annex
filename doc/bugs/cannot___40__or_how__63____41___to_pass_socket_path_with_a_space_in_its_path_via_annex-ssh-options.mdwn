### Please describe the problem.

git annex specifies its own socket path via -S.  To overload with our socket path (to be reused by annex and other ssh invocations) we need to provide the path via annex-ssh-options option.  And we cannot pass it as an overload -o ControlPath since -S specification provided by annex "overrides" it.
The difficulty comes in possibly not quite common but still possible case when path to the socket contains a space.  I have tried all kinds of possible specifications but failed to find one which works... 

Could you give me a hint!? ;)

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?

6.20170307+gitg24ade8a25-1~ndall+1
