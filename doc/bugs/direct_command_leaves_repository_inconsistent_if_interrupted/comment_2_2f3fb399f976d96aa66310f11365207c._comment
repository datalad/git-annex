I still cannot see a way that more than one file's content could end up in misctemp, since `git annex direct` moves just one file there at a time, so max of one should be there if interrupted. However, there was really no reason to be moving files through misctemp at all, so `git annex direct` now moves them into place completely atomically.

Bug report retitled appropriatly for the `git annex lock --force` suprise.
