I found an old todo about the same thing,
[[todo/Make_webapp_port_configurable]].

The idea there was, they were using docker and wanted to open only a
specific port selected for the webapp. So basically the same kind of thing.

I think that this should be a separate --port option, to avoid needing to
try to parse something that may be an ipv6 address or hostname, or
whatever.

I don't think that using --port should prevent the webapp from needing
the `?auth=' part of the url, as output when using --listen.

Probably it does not make sense to use --port without also using --listen,
but if the user does use it, I don't think --port needs to output the url
the way --listen does.
