--listen takes an IP address (or hostname),
it does not let you specify the port. I've clarified the documentation
about this.

I don't reproduce the behavior you show, when I try that the process
runs but does not bind to any port, and in .git/annex/daemon.log, I see:

	WebApp crashed: Network.Socket.getAddrInfo (called with preferred socket type/protocol: AddrInfo {addrFlags = [], addrFamily = AF_UNSPEC, addrSocketType = Stream, addrProtocol = 0, addrAddress = 0.0.0.0:0, addrCanonName = Nothing}, host name: Just "0.0.0.0:8888", service name: Nothing): does not exist (Name or service not known)

This may be an OS or resolver difference. If "0.0.0.0:8888" somehow
resolves to an IP address on your system, then the webapp will listen
on that IP address I suppose. But it's not expecting that to specify a
port.

The webapp outputs the full url, including the port it chose. 
Since that url also includes an auth token that is required to use the
webapp, specifying the port for it to listen on does not seem very useful.

What's your use case for wanting to specify a port?
