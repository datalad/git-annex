It appears like addurl --relaxed if used incombination with --file doesn't actually relax.

(I'm interested in quickly adding links to an extremely large set of files (and for a large set of revisions), and the fact that addurl takes a second or so per file makes this impossible performance-wise.)

What steps will reproduce the problem? (Well, this isn't the problem per see, but it illustrates that it does checking)

    $ echo foo > foo
    $ git annex add foo
    $ git annex addurl --relaxed http://lambda.haskell.org/platform/download/2012.4.0.0/haskell-platform-2012.4.0.0.tar.gz --file foo
    addurl foo 
      failed to verify url: http://lambda.haskell.org/platform/download/2012.4.0.0/haskell-platform-2012.4.0.0.tar.gz
    failed
    git-annex: addurl: 1 failed

What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?
