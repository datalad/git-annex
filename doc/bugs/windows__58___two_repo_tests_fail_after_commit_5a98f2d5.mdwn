### Please describe the problem.

Recently I found that two repo tests, namely 'concurrent get of dup key regression'
and 'import', fail due to locking problems. I bisected this on my Windows laptop and
found that [[!commit 5a98f2d50913682c4ebe0e0c4ce695c450a96091]] is the first bad commit.

### What steps will reproduce the problem?

`stack setup && stack build`. Then copy git-annex.exe to `C:\annx` and in (Git) Bash say:

[[!format sh """
$ ./git-annex test -p 'Repo Tests' 2>&1 | tee git-annex.test--p-Repo_Tests.LOG~202
$ grep -E '(concurrent get of dup key regression|import):' git-annex.test--p-Repo_Tests.LOG~202
"""]]

Observe two FAILs.

(It is unfortunate that you can't call for instance `./git-annex.exe test -p 'concurrent get of dup key regression'`
directly because of an unrelated setup issue with Tasty. I guess this would warrant a separate bug report.)

### Please provide any additional information below.

### Have you had any luck using git-annex before? (Sometimes we get tired of reading bug reports all day and a lil' positive end note does wonders)

Git Annex is great. I use it several times a week with my multigigabyte backups, where it gives structure to my image-based backup routines, so you could say I'm a believer. :)
