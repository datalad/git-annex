Stuck in a loop, now with every restart of git-annex it downloads the update and then uploads it to all my repositories again:
http://screencast.com/t/Ow7SlPVaS68 

And then it says: 
 Finished upgrading git-annex to version 5.20140420-ga25b8bb 
BUT that is the OLD version not the new one :-/

NEXT TRY:

killed all processes of git and git-annex, restart. 

Was greeted by: 
 An upgrade of git-annex is available.
(version 5.20140421)

Klicked the Upgrade button.
Nothing happens, except that the upgrade notice disappeared :-/
