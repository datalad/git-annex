The repeated attempts to upgrade to 21 when it only downloads 20 are due to a different bug: [[bugs/git-annex_auto_upgrade_is_redundant]]. I've just put in a quick fix that should avoid that.

However, for the purposes of this bug report, I'm interested in the original problem of \"Cannot find old distribution bundle; not upgrading\", and to fix that, I need to know how you originally installed git-annex.
