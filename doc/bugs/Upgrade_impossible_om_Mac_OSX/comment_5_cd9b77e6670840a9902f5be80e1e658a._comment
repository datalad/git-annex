I gave up on this. After doing this a few times, I stopped. Living in Africa, bandwidth is really expensive :-/ 

Initially I installed via the downloaded .dmg file. 
After poking around a few times, I found a folder inside my Applications folder:

    ls -al /Applications/gi*
    /Applications/git-annex.app:
    total 0
    drwxr-xr-x@   3 ovi   admin   102 May 12 13:10 .
    drwxrwxr-x+ 155 root  admin  5270 May 15 04:19 ..
    drwxr-xr-x    5 ovi   admin   170 May  9 15:45 Contents

    /Applications/git-annex.app.5.20140421:
    total 0
    drwxr-xr-x    2 ovi   admin    68 May 11 11:26 .
    drwxrwxr-x+ 155 root  admin  5270 May 15 04:19 ..

Every time I now open git-annex assistant I am greeted with: 

    An upgrade of git-annex is available.
    (version 5.20140421)

I just did it again and it starts downloading again arrrghh!

    Transfers
    git-annex.dmg (for upgrade)‚Üêweb 12% of 22.52 MiB

restarted the assistant and it now says: 

    Finished upgrading git-annex to version 5.20140420-ga25b8bb

Then I check and find this:

ls -al /Applications/gi*
/Applications/git-annex.app:
