I have adjusted the \"Cannot find old distribution bundle; not upgrading\" message to say where it looked, and failed to find the git-annex.app directory.

I am going to have to moreinfo this, since without knowing where git-annex was installed to, I can't say why it failed to find a git-annex.app directory.
