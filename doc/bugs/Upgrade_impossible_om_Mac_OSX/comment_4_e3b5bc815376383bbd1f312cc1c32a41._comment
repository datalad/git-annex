\"Cannot find old distribution bundle; not upgrading\"

This message means that git-annex was unable to find where the old version was installed, which it needs to do in order to replace it with the new version. It looks for a `git-annex.app` directory, and could not find one. How did you install the old version, and to what location?

I think it might try to upload the dmg file to a repository if that repository is set as a full backup and so wants all files even ones not in the work tree.
