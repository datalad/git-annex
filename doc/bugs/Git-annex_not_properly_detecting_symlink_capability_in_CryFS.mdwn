### Please describe the problem.

When creating a new git-annex repository (or upgrading, or doing fsck) inside a CryFS container (FUSE-based encrypted local filesystem, similiar to EncFS), git-annex goes into direct(or adjusted, in v6) mode despite CryFS working just fine with symlinks.

Indeed, a created-outside-cryfs git-annex repository works as expected when copied inside

### What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Install cryfs (https://www.cryfs.org/, packaged for ubuntu,debian, or build from source)
2. Create a CryFS container: $ cryfs container container-data
3. Create a git annex repository inside the container:

    $ cd container
    $ git init .
    $ git annex init --version 6

#### Cloning from v6 repository, you get

git annex init --version 6
init  
  Detected a filesystem without fifo support.

  Disabling ssh connection caching.

  Detected a crippled filesystem.

  Disabling core.symlinks.
(merging origin/git-annex into git-annex...)
(recording state in git...)
(scanning for unlocked files...)

  Entering an adjusted branch where files are unlocked as this filesystem does not support locked files.

Switched to branch 'adjusted/master(unlocked)'
ok
(recording state in git...)

#### Cloning from v5 repository and upgrading, you get

git annex upgrade
upgrade . 
  Detected a filesystem without fifo support.

  Disabling ssh connection caching.

  Detected a crippled filesystem.

  Disabling core.symlinks.
(merging origin/git-annex into git-annex...)
(recording state in git...)

  Enabling direct mode.
(v5 to v6...) (scanning for unlocked files...)
ok
(recording state in git...)

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?
git-annex-6.20170519-1.fc26.x86_64

### Have you had any luck using git-annex before? (Sometimes we get tired of reading bug reports all day and a lil' positive end note does wonders)

I love git-annex.
