### Please describe the problem.

There is no way to specify the commit message used by the pull command.

### What steps will reproduce the problem?

When pulling from a special remote with importtree=yes to get new/modified files, git-annex generates the commit message. It is desired to specify the commit message to describe the content being pulled.

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?

10.20231130-g0e9bc415882a5e3a285e004cf9f80936e5762a07
Linux

### Please provide any additional information below.

[[!format sh """
# If you can, paste a complete transcript of the problem occurring here.
# If the problem is with the git-annex assistant, paste in .git/annex/daemon.log


# End of transcript or log.
"""]]

### Have you had any luck using git-annex before? (Sometimes we get tired of reading bug reports all day and a lil' positive end note does wonders)
