The Windows installer includes numerous DLLs from Cygwin. I have tested it in a non-cygwin environment and it seems to work for me, and for other users. At least generally.. perhaps it *is* missing something used by wget or curl?

Can you please provide the names of the DLLs that seem to be missing?
