With git-annex 10.20230329-g30d7f9ad7 I got the following message after checking out `adjusted/master(unlockpresent)` and running `git annex copy --from foo --to bar -J2`:

```
git-annex: .git/HEAD: openFile: resource busy (file is locked)\"
```

This message appeared at the very end of the `copy` process.

Regardless of this, everything seems to work just fine.
