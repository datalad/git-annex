I was able to reproduce something that looks similar to this without
needing to interrupt any command:

	joey@darkstar:~/tmp/bench>git clone a b
	Cloning into 'b'...
	done.
	joey@darkstar:~/tmp/bench>cd b
	joey@darkstar:~/tmp/bench/b>git config annex.adjustedbranchrefresh 1
	joey@darkstar:~/tmp/bench/b>git annex adjust --unlock-present
	adjust 
	Switched to branch 'adjusted/master(unlockpresent)'
	ok
	joey@darkstar:~/tmp/bench/b#master(unlockpresent)>ls
	foo@
	joey@darkstar:~/tmp/bench/b#master(unlockpresent)>git-annex get
	get foo (from origin...) 
	ok                                
	(recording state in git...)
	joey@darkstar:~/tmp/bench/b#master(unlockpresent)>ls
	foo
	joey@darkstar:~/tmp/bench/b#master(unlockpresent)>git-annex drop
	drop foo ok
	error: Your local changes to the following files would be overwritten by checkout:
		foo
	Please commit your changes or stash them before you switch branches.
	Aborting
	
	  Updating adjusted branch failed.
	(recording state in git...)

And it was left in a similar detached head status:

	HEAD detached at 2aab85d
	nothing to commit, working tree clean

This seems be be a bug with the implementation of annex.adjustedbranchrefresh
