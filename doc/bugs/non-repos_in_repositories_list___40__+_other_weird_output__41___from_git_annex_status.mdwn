### Please describe the problem.

when running ```git annex status``` i get 'alien' content in the list of repositories (some timestamps, something looking like git status messages, and a long list of ```(recovery from race)``` messages. the actual content seems fine and the list of repositories in the assistant looks ok, but the CLI status messages show this unusual content (full dump below).

### What steps will reproduce the problem?

not sure how i would go about reproducing this: i only noticed this weird output just now and i'm pretty sure it was fine 24h ago - in the meanwhile the single non-ordinary operation was deleting via the assistant's webapp an SSH remote, rsync+encryption, then creating it again as bare repo without encryption.

after the assistant finished removing all the content from the previous annex directory, it stalled reporting deletion in progress (the annex directory's parent on the remote server was not writeable for the user used for the ssh connection - perhaps that was the cause). even after chowning the parent dir and restarting the assistant on my local workstation, the assistant would still show the remote as pending deletion.

after a while i could add the remote again, setting it to be a git bare repo, and content was copied over.

from the assistant's webapp, i still see the correct list of remotes, but the output of ```git annex status``` is as below.

```.git/config``` also looks ok, listing some core settings, some annex settings and my three real remotes for this annex.

the part of logs relevant to the above change (deletion of remote, creation of new one + content sync) is unfortunately gone from the annex logs (including the rotated ones in ```.git/annex/daemon.log*```).

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?

4.20130709:amd64 on Debian testing (linux 3.9.8-1)
