the behavior is rooted in rsync, which behaves similar to `mkdir -p`. it can probably be worked around by configuring the rsync option `--chmod=775`, but that would add executability to files.

i've opened a bug in rsync's bug tracker at <https://bugzilla.samba.org/show_bug.cgi?id=9377>, let's see what the developer says.
