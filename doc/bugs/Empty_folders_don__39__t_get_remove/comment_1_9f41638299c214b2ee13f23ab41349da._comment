I can't reproduce this. Tested in direct mode (which I assume you're using, but you didn't say), using both command-line `git annex sync`, and using the assistant. In all cases, when the last file in a directory was removed, the directory was deleted.

Please write back with a version number, and an example showing the problem happening.
