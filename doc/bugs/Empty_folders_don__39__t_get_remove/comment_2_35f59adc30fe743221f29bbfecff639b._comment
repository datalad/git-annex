Hi,

I experienced this just now.  Have a git-annex assistant repo set up (so using direct mode).

On one machine, I mv'd entire directories out of the git-annex repo.

The other machine saw the files deleted, but the directories remained.

On the machine on which I mv'd directories out, git-annex actually re-created some of them with symlinks to now-nonexistant hashes!  I have no idea why it did that.
