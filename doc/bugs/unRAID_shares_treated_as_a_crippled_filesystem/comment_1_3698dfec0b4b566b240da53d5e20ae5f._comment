Lack of support for hard links does not make git-annex enable 
crippled filesystem mode. Lack of support for either symlinks
or unix permissions are the only things that cause that.

I assume that you've checked that you can create symlinks on the UnRaid.

Unix permissions may *seem* to work, eg they can be set. However, git-annex
checks if they *actually* work, by creating a file, removing the write bit,
and trying to write to it. If the write succeeds, the filesystem is not
actually honoring permissions.

Using git-annex in indirect mode with such a filesystem can
result in data loss. For example:

	git annex add foo
	git commit foo -m added
	echo corrupt > foo

Here the echo follows the symlink to the single copy of the file in
.git/annex/objects/ and ignoring the permissions that don't allow writing
it it, overwrites it with other data. `git annex fsck` will then tell you
that you've lost the old content of the file.

So, I don't recommend trying to bypass git-annex's check for crippled
filesystems.
