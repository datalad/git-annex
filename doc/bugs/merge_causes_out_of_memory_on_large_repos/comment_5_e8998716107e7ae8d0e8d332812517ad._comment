That doesn't look very big, I merge one 3x that large on a 128 mb machine.

I think you will need to either email me privately so I can get a copy of your repository to investigate with ... or you can try to investigate on your own. 

I think the first things I would try to debug this are to look over `git annex merge --debug` and see if I see anything unusual, and then I would probably `git checkout git-annex` in the repository, and wc -l on all the files and see if any file has a lot of lines, or is otherwise very large.

If that found nothing, my next step would be to rebuild git-annex from source with memory profiling enabled, as explained in this book, and try to get a memory profiling graph that explained what was using up the memory. <http://book.realworldhaskell.org/read/profiling-and-optimization.html>
