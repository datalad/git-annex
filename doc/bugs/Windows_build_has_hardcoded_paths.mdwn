### Please describe the problem.

The windows build seems to be hardcoded to finding git at c:\program files\Git\
I have git in another directory. Git-annex does not find it.

### What steps will reproduce the problem?

Install git-annex. Run the webapp.
Get error "Internal Server Error 
You need to install git in order to use git-annex!"

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?

Latest windows build, from 20140817

### Please provide any additional information below.
