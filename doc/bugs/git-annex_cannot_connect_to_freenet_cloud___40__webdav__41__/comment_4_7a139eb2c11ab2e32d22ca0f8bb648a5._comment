As to where the first byte went, it seems rather suggestive that the part
of the server's code you pasted earlier reads out `$firstByte`. Perhaps it
forgot to preserve that first byte in the file.

Which is horrible, but then there's the "Conflict" error. All I can make of
this is that the server is probably rejecting the MOVE request for some reason.
That might be reasonable if the destination file already existed, 
but I don't think it does in this case, so who knows.

Only thing I'm sure of is, I never want to entrust this particular webdav
server with any of my data!
