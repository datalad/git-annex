I get what you're saying, but there's a layering problem that prevents
the JSON display of a higher layer being used by a lower layer that is
finding files to operate on.

Trying to copy a file that does not exist is a fundamentally
different class of error that an error that occurs when copying a file
that does exist. A memory read error resulting in a SIGBUS is a different
class of error, as is a git failure due to a corrupted repository.
git-annex fails in four entirely different ways in these four cases.
