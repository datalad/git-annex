@Andreas Duering, your problem was indeed a bug in git-annex;
I think it got introduced somewhere around April 2017, and I just fixed it
last week.

However, it does not seem related to the original bug report from 2013, which,
despite the title, did not seem to have anything to do with drive letters.

Since this bug report has languished since 2013 without the submitter
providing any information, I suppose I'll close this bug report.
