Hi Joey, thanks for looking into this and your work on git-annex! You're correct on both counts. After posting the report I tried manually adding the file and, indeed, restarting the assistant also makes it notice the file. I'm still exploring, but what seemed to be inscrutable behaviour at first, now seems reasonable enough.

I've also encountered some access violations and I'm running into sqlite errors on WSL (1 & 2), both of which probably aren't worth reporting at this time, and the latter of which is probably out of scope of this bug tracker, anyway.
