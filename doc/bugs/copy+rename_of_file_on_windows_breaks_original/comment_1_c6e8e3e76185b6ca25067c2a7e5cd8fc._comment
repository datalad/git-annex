Well, this appears to be a case where the assistant somehow misses the
rename of the file, so it has not gotten around to annexing it.

You can get the same error message when not using the assistant, eg:

	# touch foo
	# git-annex info foo
	fatal: Not a valid object name foo
	info foo (not a directory or an annexed file or a treeish or a remote or a uuid) failed

I guess that `git-annex add` would resolve your problem.
The assistant should also notice the file the next time it starts up,
and add it the same as it would any new file.
