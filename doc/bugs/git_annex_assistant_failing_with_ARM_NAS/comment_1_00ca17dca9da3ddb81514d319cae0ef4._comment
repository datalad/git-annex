The assistant's automation for setting up a remote ssh server is what looks
to be failing. It seems that this NAS has a problem with ssh being used to
run a sh -c command. Probably the NAS's shell is not POSIX compliant
in some way.

The best thing to do in this situation is to set up the git remote
on the NAS manually. Once it's set up, the assistant should be able to use
it.
