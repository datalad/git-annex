FWIW: might be not git-annex specific since I also observe now some stalls with `git push` as well, gets stuck on `Writing objects:  96% (1855/1932)`. Using newer git (2.45.1) from within a singularity env on client didn't help, so must be connection or target git (running `git receive-pack`) related... heh - the costs of upgrades! ;-)
