### Please describe the problem.

I run a script (via cron) to sync my various git-annex repositories. Recently, I noticed the following error message (which I'd not seen before):

    bash: git-annex-shell: command not found

I can't say for certain when it first appeared, but I first noticed it after recently upgrading to git-annex 6.20170519.

### What steps will reproduce the problem?

    git annex sync -J5

(or using any other 'jobs' option via -Jx or --jobs=x, including setting 'jobs' to '1')

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?

6.20170519 on MacOS Sierra (installed via homebrew)

### Please provide any additional information below.

git annex sync (without a 'jobs' option) does not produce the error message.

In the sample transcripts below, RAID10 is a local drive. unraid, manuel & drobo are all accessed via ssh.

[[!format sh """
# If you can, paste a complete transcript of the problem occurring here.
# If the problem is with the git-annex assistant, paste in .git/annex/daemon.log

[tom:~/annex/dl] git annex sync -J1

### Have you had any luck using git-annex before? (Sometimes we get tired of reading bug reports all day and a lil' positive end note does wonders)

I've used git-annex for well over a year, syncing multiple repositories, without a problem. I don't know how I ever got along without it! :-)
