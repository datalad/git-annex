When a secondary worktree is used on a filesystem not supporting symlinks,
it would be possible for `git-annex move` to move an object from another
repository. And store it to the wrong location, under
`.git/worktrees/foo/annex/objects/`. The object would still be accessible,
and a later `git-annex copy --to remote`, if run in the same worktree,
would be able to send the object on to a remote.

But if this bug gets fixed, then the misplaced object file will be left,
and won't be used any longer. Which could appear to the user as data loss
in some situations. Eg, the copy to the remote would fail. (There might be
situations where the populated worktree file would be used as a copy of the
object, but that assumes the worktree file is still populated.)

Also, `git-annex drop` would not delete such misplaced object files, so the
user would be left with bloated repository.

So, `git-annex fsck` will need to be made to search out such misplaced
object files and move them to the correct objects directory.
