I've verified that `populatePointerFile` is not getting called in this case,
and does get called in the same situation on ext4. And that call is made by
`reconcileStaged`, which is getting called. 
So I would look in there for the bug.

Except, interestingly, some percent of the time, on ext4, manually
populating the pointer file followed by git-annex add also does not call
`populatePointerFile`. The pointer file remains unpopulated  until another
process calls `reconcileStaged`, and it gets populated then. This seems
like also a bug, possibly another case of the same bug?
