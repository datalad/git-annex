In a FAT filesystem after reproducing this bug with initial file `foo`,
the following thing also happens:

	joey@darkstar:~/mnt/demo-wt3#demo-wt3>cat foo
	/annex/objects/SHA256E-s30--dcf81122854db210a12a47851a3430b6ab000e3f981b5266f0873b94d130c999
	joey@darkstar:~/mnt/demo-wt3#demo-wt3>cp foo bar
	joey@darkstar:~/mnt/demo-wt3#demo-wt3>git add bar
	joey@darkstar:~/mnt/demo-wt3#demo-wt3>cat bar
	/annex/objects/SHA256E-s30--dcf81122854db210a12a47851a3430b6ab000e3f981b5266f0873b94d130c999

This seems to be another case of the bug, because the content of the object
is present in the repository, so usually `git add` of a pointer file
should result in the smudge filter populating it.

`git-annex add` behaves the same as well.
