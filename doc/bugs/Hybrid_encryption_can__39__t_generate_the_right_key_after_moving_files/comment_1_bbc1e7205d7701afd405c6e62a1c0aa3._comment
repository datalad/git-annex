Hello,

I have no idea why git-annex fails to decrypt your file, but as for the two different HMAC keys, I guess you have chunking enabled on that remote (at least when you uploaded the file) and that first HMAC key is the right key for the 1st chunk of your file. That decryption script does not take chunks into account, so you were only able to generate the second HMAC key, which should be the right key if the file was uploaded without chunking enabled. I've just [posted][1] a modified version of the script that supports chunks.
