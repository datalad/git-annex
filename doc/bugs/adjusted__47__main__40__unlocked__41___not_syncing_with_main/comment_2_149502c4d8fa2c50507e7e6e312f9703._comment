For an adjusted branch, git-annex keeps
a hidden  ref, `refs/basis/adjusted/master(unlocked)`. 
That ref also needs to be renamed if you're going to
rename the adjusted branch and the original branch.

It's of course fine to delete the old adjusted branch and
re-adjust the new branch.

I think that git-annex should warn if it cannot find 
the basis ref for an adjusted branch.
