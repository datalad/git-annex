Update:

I was able to resolve the problem - believe that it was caused by the fact that I changed branch name from `master` to `main` and had leftover `refs/basis/adjusted/master(unlocked)`.

Resolved following this steps:

```
git switch main
git annex merge \"adjusted/main(unlocked)\"
git branch -D \"adjusted/main(unlocked)\"
rm -rf .git/refs/basis/*
git annex adjust --unlocked
```

Tested that sync is now working
