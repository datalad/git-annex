What steps will reproduce the problem?

As described in
http://git-annex.branchable.com/backends/#comment-3c1cd45d2a015b4fc412dd813293ad7d
, sha512 is faster. On my 64-bit system, the speed difference is about
1.5times.

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?


What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?
