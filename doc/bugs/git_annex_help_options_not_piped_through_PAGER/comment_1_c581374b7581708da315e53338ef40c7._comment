"git annex help options" is not a thing in the current version of
git-annex. Please upgrade to a current version before filing bug reports.

git-annex outputs to stderr when it's run with invalid
parameters. So `git annex` will output to stderr (`2>&1 | less` to page
it). `git annex add --help` outputs to stdout since the user requested
usage help and didn't do anything wrong. `git annex help add` displays the
man page, which uses a pager. That is all consistent with git's
behavior, and is fairly typical for unix programs.
