But how would I configure git-annex assistant in this case?

My plan was to somehow add the information about the repos etc. using the command line interface and then just start the assistant using 'git annex assistant --autostart' as the terminal startup command.

Would that work?

By the way, is there any documentation about how to use the assistant without the web interface?

I could only find information about how to configure the assistant using the web app.

Thanks for your help!
