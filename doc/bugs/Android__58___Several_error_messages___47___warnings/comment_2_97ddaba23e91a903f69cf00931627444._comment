I think the CPU of my phone is not good enough to be usable with a web browser on my phone.

I can use Git Annex without the WebApp without phone stability problems. But if I start the WebApp then nothing works (it seems 100% of my CPU is used - but it could also be that the CPU monitor app did freeze).

Websites like Google and Wikipedia work without problems but I had another website that made my phone unusable and forced me to restart my phone.

I think therefore my phone is the problem and not Git Annex.

So, the best way for me to use Git Annex on my phone is probably the cammand line interface.

Besides the text relocations warning there was another message that said \"Falling back to hardcoded app location: cannot find expected files in $path\".

Is this a problem or does everything work properly?
