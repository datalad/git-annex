I don't think that the warning about text relocations is a significant
source of memory usage.

It would probably help if you can get some memory use value for git-annex
while it's running, and for chrome after it's loaded the git-annex webapp.
These are two separate uses of memory, and it's not clear which one is
actually using up too much of your memory.

I've run git-annex on android systems that are smaller than 512 mb, and
generally the assistant only uses a few MB of memory on other platforms.
