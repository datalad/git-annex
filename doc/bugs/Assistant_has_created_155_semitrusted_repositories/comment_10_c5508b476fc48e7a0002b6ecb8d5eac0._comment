It's normal for the git-annex assistant to keep a couple of long-running git cat-file and git check-attr processes running at all times. So I'd not worry about that.

I received the emailed tarball of uuid.log versions. (message-id CAL5AKQq9i4QwReWHZkKOm1Ggon66FqFkjbM832PP1drgiR3x5g@mail.gmail.com)

Can you show the command you used to dump those files? Because the contents of them is really quite weird. 

Take file 0, which I'm guessing might be the first version of the uuid.log. It starts off with what I'd expect to see in a uuid.log, but then has a section of what looks like trust.log data, followed by what is certianly supposed to be remote.log data, followed by what looks like `git show 966ec7aaf408dffe0d6e6ce04aebc15dc5b26f5b`, a commit which apparently was made by \"Firstname.Lastname@somedomain.com\" (unless you anonymized that) and added a file `test` to the git repository.

It gets worse, some of the versions of the uuid.log file appear to be megabytes in size, which is just insane, and these contain more such apparent `git show` of git commits adding files to the repository.

The general pattern of uuid.log data +trust.log data + remote.log data + git show of a commit seems to repeat in each version of the uuid.log file.
