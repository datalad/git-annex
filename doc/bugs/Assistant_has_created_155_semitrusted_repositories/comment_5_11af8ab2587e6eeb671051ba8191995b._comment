One client is a thinkpad 121e, the other one a hp Z420 workstation. The archive is a basic Dell desktop. All of them run wheezy with git-annex and git  from official backports. The transfer repository is at rsync.net. 

The daemon.log file was empty at the time I noticed the situation. Now git-annex has been scanning this repository for some time and the log has information again but it looks a bit too long to be posted here. I will email about the repository copy and the log.
