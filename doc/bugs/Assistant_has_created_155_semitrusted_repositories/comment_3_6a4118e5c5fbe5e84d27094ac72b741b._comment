Any chance I could get a copy of this git repository? (Excluding the .git/annex part)

Feel free to email me id@joeyh.name to arrange a secure transfer.

Otherwise, I need to see what the git-annex:uuid.log file looked like before this happened to it. The corruption may have occurred progressively in several commits, or all at once.

You might also still have some logs in `.git/annex/daemon.log*`, and sending those might help, assuming the strange messages you mentioned are logged in there.

This is pretty weird thing to be in the uuid.log. The \"1\" makes me think this might be a scrambled version of what's normally stored in the trust.log:

This seems to be the same bug as [[bugs/non-repos in repositories list (+ other weird output) from git annex status]]
