### Please describe the problem.

When using `git annex sync --content` with two archive with different cost, git annex will upload my file to the first archive, then to the second one, then it will drop it from the first one.

### What steps will reproduce the problem?

I've set both remote to "trusted", both in the "archive" group, both with "standard" preferred content, the remote named "hubic2" as an annex-cost of 200.0, and the remote named "hubic3" as an annex-cost of 175.0

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?
I'm using git-annex 5.20141125 on Debian Sid (upgraded today on November 7 2014).

### Please provide any additional information below.
