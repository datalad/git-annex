If the object file is executable at `git-annex unlock` time, the pointer
file is made executable. If the object is then dropped, the pointer file
remains executable.

So shouldn't it be the case for symmetry that `git-annex adjust --unlock`
should make the pointer file executable, and a drop followed by re-doing
the same adjustment should leave the pointer file executable? That would
argue for leaving it stable.

I don't think there's a perfect solution to that question, both behaviors
seem perhaps wanted at different times. But since leaving it stable avoids
extra work, I'm leaning toward that.
