### Please describe the problem.
When "git annex sync --content" is used only objects currently in the working tree are synced. It doesn't honor full archives, which should get all objects.
So only objects similar to "git annex find --want-get" are synced and not every available object "git annex get --all"


### What steps will reproduce the problem?
# mein repo:
git annex add file
git annex sync
git annex rm file
git annex sync

# other repo:
git annex wanted here "not copies=backup:3"
git annex find --want-get # will be empty
git annex sync --content # nothing is synced even so all files should be backed up
git annex get --all # will sync the object from file

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?
git-annex version: 5.20140210-gd99db49
Linux (Ubuntu 13.10)
