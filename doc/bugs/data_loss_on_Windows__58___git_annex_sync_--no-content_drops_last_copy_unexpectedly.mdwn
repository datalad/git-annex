### Please describe the problem.
A seemingly harmless script causes data loss by dropping last copy of file content.

In my test this script only drops file content on Windows. On Linux it's working good, even on a crippled filesystem.

### What steps will reproduce the problem?
run the following script test.sh:
[[!format sh """
mkdir a
cd a
git init
git annex init first
mkdir folder
echo foo > folder/1.txt
git annex add .
git annex sync
cd ..
git clone a b
cd b
git annex init second
git annex sync
cd ../a
git remote add second ../b
git annex sync
git annex move --to second
git annex sync
mv folder folder1
git annex add
git annex sync
cd ../b
git annex sync
"""]]

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?
git-annex version: 6.20161231-gc8eeb17

Windows 10.0.14393 and also Windows 8

### Please provide any additional information below.

### Conclusion

I'm so attracted to git-annex's idea, but seems it's still not robust enough to use on Windows platform - v5 direct mode repo is as far as I can get, yet it still throws away my data like this...
