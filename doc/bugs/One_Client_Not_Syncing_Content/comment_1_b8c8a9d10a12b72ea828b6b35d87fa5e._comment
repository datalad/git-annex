What version of git-annex is installed on laptopA?

If it's too old, it won't be getting change notifications from the server
when laptopB pushes to it.

Since laptopB immediately notices pushes from laptopA, I guess that
both laptopB and the server have new enough versions of git-annex
for that change noitification to work.
