Unfortunately, `git hash-object --stdin-paths` does not support
-z or anything like that. It is a newline based protocol.

Ok, made git-annex fall back to running git hash-object once
per file when the filenames contain newlines to work around that.

BTW, another problem I noticed is that the repository decription
written to uuid.log contains a newline, which prevents parsing that line of
the log correctly. This can also be seen by passing a value
with a newline to `git-annex describe`. It would also happen in the
case with the newline directory if it didn't fail earlier.

Another log file that has a similar problem BTW is config.log,
which can get a newline in a value with eg
`git annex config --set annex.largefiles "xxx\nyyy"`
and the result is that reading the value back out omits
the part after the newline.
