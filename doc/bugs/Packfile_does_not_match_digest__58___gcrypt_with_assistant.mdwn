### Please describe the problem.
I tried to sync a folder between two laptops, using the webapp and GPG encryption. I started by seting up the repository on laptop1, and then, while all the files were uploading, I went over to laptop2 and set things up there as well.

At first, everything looked fine, laptop1 was uploading and laptop2 was downloading. Then, laptop2 reported "Failed to sync with VPS, and the log file showed a gcrypt error: "Packfile long-hash does not match digest!"

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?



Laptop1 is running wheezy with git annex version 6.20160307+gitgb095561-1~ndall+1 from neurodebian.

VPS is running wheezy

Laptop2 is runing jessie with git annex version 6.20160307+gitgb095561-1~ndall+1 from neurodebian.

### Have you had any luck using git-annex before?

If I could get this syncing to work, then that would be great! I don't want to use unison, because that wouldn't be encrypted... So this would be wonderful.
