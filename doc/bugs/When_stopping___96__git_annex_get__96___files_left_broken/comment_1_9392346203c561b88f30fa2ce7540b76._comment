Thing is, git-annex get does not update the file in place. Only once the
entire file is downloaded, and its content is verified correct is it moved
into a place where you can access it.

So, it seems much more likely to me that the content of the file, as
originally added to git-annex, was bad, and the it had just finished
verifying the content and moving it into place when you interruped the
command.

Please check with `git annex fsck` on the file and see if it determines
it has the content git-annex expects it to have.

However, I notice you're using a v6 repository. Is the file an unlocked
file? It's possible that in that specific case there could be a bug.
I've interrupted `git annex get` on a nearly daily basis for years, but
v6 is still experimental and not as well tested.
