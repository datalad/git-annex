When downloading with annex.stalldetection configured, `git-annex
transferrer` is used. If a download is prevented by annex.diskreserve
setting, the message displayed says that --force will override the check.
But that doesn't work in this case. 

The --force option should be propagated to this command. --[[Joey]]
