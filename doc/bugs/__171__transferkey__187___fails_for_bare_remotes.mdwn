### Please describe the problem.

I wanted to inspect the state of an object present in a bare remote
without touching the working copy. So I issued «transferkey $KEY --from
bare-remote»; however, even for keys that are definitely present on
the remote, this would fail with «requested key is not present».

The same method, when using a non-bare repo in «--from», would succeed
under otherwise identical conditions.

### What steps will reproduce the problem?

Cf. above.

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?

git-annex 5.20140708

Linux 3.15.4
