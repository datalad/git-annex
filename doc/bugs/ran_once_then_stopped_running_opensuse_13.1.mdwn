Installed stand-alone tarball amd64.
I was able to launch webapp. (on laptop)
Created a repository to local home directory.
Then ceated another repository to invite local desktop pc.(this one had all the files i wanted to sync) 
Went to dektop and accepted invitation.  But both machines never stopped synching?  and nothing really happened.
so I removed repository on laptop to start fresh.
But now webapp does nothing.  I removed and re-installed a few times but still nothing.
Only as superuser will the webapp attempt to load but fails because it is super user running.
As far as version of git-annex...  it prompted to upgrade and i think i saw a 5 in there somewhere.

and since it won't load anymore i guess there is no log.
