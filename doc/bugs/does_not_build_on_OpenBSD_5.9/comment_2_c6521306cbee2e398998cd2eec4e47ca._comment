Perhaps running ````stack install git-annex```` (using the implicit global project) ignores the flags in stack.yaml, see [#1313](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/issues/1313). Following your suggestion, I tried cloning the repo and building using `stack build` both with and without the XMPP flag. Without the flag works fine, it seems the default ````false```` setting form xmpp flag in stack.yaml is honored when building *this* way.

In any case, this worked:

````
$ git clone git://git-annex.branchable.com/ git-annex
$ cd git-annex
$ git checkout 6.20160511
$ stack build
$ stack install
````
