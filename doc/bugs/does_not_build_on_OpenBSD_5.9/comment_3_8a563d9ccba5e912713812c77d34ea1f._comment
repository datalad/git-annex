Not sure if that stack bug you linked to is quite a match for what it's
doing, so I opened a new one:
<https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/issues/2371>

I don't currently see anything I could do in git-annex to avoid this
problem.

What version of stack are you using? It could be that a newer version of
stack doesn't have the problem.
