The build error suggests a problem with either the libidn.a library in
openbsd, or the haskell bindings to it in gnuidn.

A similar problem is discussed in [[More_build_oddities_under_OpenBSD]].

Disabling XMPP support in git-annex makes it not need either library,
so should avoid the problem. Eg: `stack build --flag git-annex:-XMPP`

(Although AFAICS, XMPP support is disabled by default in stack.yaml anyway,
so I am not sure why your stack build included it.)
