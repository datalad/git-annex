Thanks for your reply, Joey.  Sorry for the delay getting back to this -- I didn't realize I hadn't enabled notifications on the thread.

The GCS docs suggest that 400 errors should be accompanied by an explanation in the reply body.

> Error responses usually include a JSON document in the response body, which contains information about the error.

Do you think we're not getting an http response body here, or that it's not being printed out?
