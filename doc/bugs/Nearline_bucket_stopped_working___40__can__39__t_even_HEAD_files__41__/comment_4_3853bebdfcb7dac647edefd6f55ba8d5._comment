I'd expect that the respone body is indeed not shown by --debug.

A timestamp bug seems as good a theory as anything. In either the S3
library git-annex is using, or the S3 emulation Google Cloud Storage is
using. Or perhaps google has different versions of the servers that behave
differently.

Over on [[tips/using_Google_Cloud_Storage]], @Dosenpfand
reports what looks like the same 400 when initializing a nearline remote.

Since this is using a S3 interoperability layer in Google Cloud Storage,
I'd not be surprised if there were bugs or limitations in it. 
Using the native GCS API seems like an increasingly good idea,
and <https://github.com/bgilbert/gcsannex> implements that.
