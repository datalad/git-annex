If you pass the --debug option, the debug output includes a transcript of
the S3 http session.

I can confirm there have been no recent changes to git-annex's S3 support.
Of course it's possible that if you upgraded git-annex the version of
<http://hackage.haskell.org/package/aws> used changed, but that seems
unlikely to cause such breakage.

Seems likely that if it's stopped working, something changed on Google's
end..
