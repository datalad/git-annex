If you pass the --debug option, the debug output includes a transcript of
the S3 http session. Edit: I see you did that, so you can in fact see
the query and response in the debug output.

I can confirm there have been no recent changes to git-annex's S3 support.
Of course it's possible that if you upgraded git-annex the version of

unlikely to cause such breakage.

Seems likely that if it's stopped working, something changed on Google's
