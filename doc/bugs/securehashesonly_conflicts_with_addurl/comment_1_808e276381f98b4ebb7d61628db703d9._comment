I think that git-annex addurl without --fast or --relaxed should
work with annex.securehashesonly set. (Unless annex.backend is set 
to something it prevents adding.) It is currently failing because
of a temporary URL key that never reaches the repository. So the check
should be disabled for that.

Arguably with --relaxed (or --fast) it should also fail. However,
that does not actually download the content, so it does not technically
add content to the repository that is not using a cryptographically
signed hash. That's how it manages to skate by without failing.
Of course git-annex get will later fail, git-annex fsck 
will complain, etc.
