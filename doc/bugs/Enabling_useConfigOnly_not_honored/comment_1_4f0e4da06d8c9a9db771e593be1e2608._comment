Yeah, git-annex goes to considerable trouble to make sure it can convince
git to commit. This is because, when I didn't do that, I was *inundated*
with bug reports from users with poorly configured systems where git cannot
guess a default user.name for various reasons.

I'm willing to support user.useConfigOnly, but only to the extent it
doesn't make me have to deal with all that again.

And I think it's probably unncessary for git-annex to set user.name and
user.email in the git config ever. It should be able to temporarily override
them when it needs to do so.
