### Please describe the problem.

When pushing to a special remote, non-largefiles (Git text files) are not filtered by the wanted setting.

### What steps will reproduce the problem?

Push to a directory special remote with exporttree and importtree set yes. The wanted setting filters largefiles, but all Git text files are included even though some are not included in the filter.

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?

# End of transcript or log.

### Have you had any luck using git-annex before? (Sometimes we get tired of reading bug reports all day and a lil' positive end note does wonders)
