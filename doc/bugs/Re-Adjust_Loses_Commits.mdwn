Hey there,

I have come across a condition that leads to the "loss" of commits.

### Please describe the problem.
After merging some branch into an adjusted branch, git annex can no longer sync the adjusted branch with the main branch. `git annex sync` prints `unable to propagate merge commit Ref "XXX" back to Ref "refs/heads/main"`, however the exit code does not indicate failure.

Based on this statement from the adjust man page:
> Re-running  this  command with the same options while inside the adjusted branch will update the adjusted branch as necessary (eg for --hide-missing and --unlock-present), and will also propagate commits back to the original branch.

I re-adjusted the branch. However, this printed the same warning, but reset the adjusted branch back to main, leading to the loss of all commits only present in the adjusted branch.

### What steps will reproduce the problem?
The sequence of commands below reproduces the issue. Create a fresh git-annex repository and create some commit in it. Then create a new branch and adding a commit there. Switch back to the main branch, and adjust it. Merge the new branch into the adjusted branch. Create some more commits in the adjusted branch. Try to sync the adjusted branch with the main branch. `git annex sync` fails, while `git annex adjust` leads to the loss of the second and third commit.

```sh
# Setup Repo
mkdir test && cd test
git init
git annex init

# Add first data
echo "Some first data" > 01
git annex add 01
git commit -m "Add first data"

# Create adjusted branch
git annex adjust --hide-missing --unlock

# Branch of main and add data
git switch main
git switch -c new
echo "Some second data" > 02
git annex add 02
git commit -m "Add second data"

# Merge new branch into adjusted
git switch "adjusted/main(hidemissing-unlocked)"
git merge new --no-edit

# Add more data to adjusted
echo "Some third data" > 03
git annex add 03
git commit -m "Add third data"

# Try to sync adjusted with main
# This reports "unable to propagate merge commit Ref XXX back to Ref "refs/heads/main"
git annex sync

# Try to sync by re-adjusting
# Also reports the unable to propagate, but also resets "adjusted/main(hidemissing-unlocked)" to the very first commit, loosing two subsequent two
git annex adjust --hide-missing --unlock
```

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?

Version 10.20250416-X on Linux:

But it also occurred on a macOS system, of which I do not have the version at hand.

### Please provide any additional information below.
Do you know how I can recover the lost commits?

### Have you had any luck using git-annex before?
Git-annex is such a great piece of software, thanks for creating it. I use it to manage my photography archive. I have a main branch that contains all my images and that I sync and backup across various devices. When adding new images to the archive I create a branch just containing those new images. After culling those photos, I merge it into main. Git-annex does a perfect jobs with this.
But now I started using some SW that cannot deal with symlinks, so I use an adjusted branch of main. Merging the new import branch into the adjusted branch leads to the described issue.

Many thanks and have a great day!
