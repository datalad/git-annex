If so you should be able to see the two git-annex's running in ps when this hang occurs
with the git process in between them.
That would be very helpful to verify since it would narrow down the git command
that runs this git-annex child process.

git-annex does deal with exactly this kind of scenario when running eg
`git update-index`, by setting an environment variable to tell the child git-annex
process not to re-lock the pid lock. But not in eg the case of a git merge.

So, if you can narrow it down specifically to `git merge` running when this
happens, or whatever other command, it should be easy to fix it.

Hmm, I suppose that it makes sense `git merge` will sometimes need to check if
a worktree file is modified, and so run git-annex. I'm pretty convinced by your
transcript that it is the git merge that's hanging. So I've gone ahead and put
in the workaround for that. There's of course still the possibility there's
some other git command I've not anticipated that still needs the workaround.
