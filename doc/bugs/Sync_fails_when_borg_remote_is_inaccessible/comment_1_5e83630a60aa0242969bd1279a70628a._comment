Note that same thing happens when a directory special remote is configured
with importtree=yes exporttree=yes and the directory gets moved out of the
way. (Well, it does now.. Previously it failed to fail and imported an empty
tree, which was much worse a bug.)

Failure to access the borg repo doesn't prevent the rest of the sync from
happening though. It still syncs with other remotes.

Yes, there is a special case in sync to skip local git repositories that
are not present. Skipping borg and directory special remotes would need
that special case to be improved to an interface.
