For the benefit of future readers, I did manage to [get the stand alone `git-annex` running on my Synology DS216+](http://ewen.mcneill.gen.nz/blog/entry/2017-05-28-git-annex-on-synology-ds216+/).  With a little bit of sorting out details, including adding some symlinks in `/usr/bin`, it runs like `git-annex` on any other Linux-based system.  At this time that is definitely much easier than trying to use a SMB share if you are able to enable `ssh` access -- but note that `ssh` access to the Synology NAS requires an administrator account, so may not be available to everyone.  (Plus of course this work around is useful mainly to relatively open Linux-based NAS solutions.)
