After posting this bug, I found a [git annex tip on running a standalone build on the Synology NAS](http://git-annex.branchable.com/tips/Synology_NAS_and_git_annex/), so that may provide another workaround for me.  Particularly since the Synology DS216+ is actually a x86-64 based system:

    ewen@nas01:/volume1$ uname -a
    Linux nas01 3.10.102 #15047 SMP Thu Feb 23 02:23:28 CST 2017 x86_64 GNU/Linux synology_braswell_216+II
    ewen@nas01:/volume1$ 

but it is probably still worth figuring out the cause of the transfer lock issue on SMB for other SMB use cases.
