### Please describe the problem.

I have multiple git-annex assistant repos that I want watched.  On startup, it is only watching one of them, despite all of them being listed in ~/.config/git-annex/autostart.  

Launching the webapp, clicking on the "switch repository" button, and selecting the other repository will cause git-annex to immediately launch a startup scan and thereafter it seems to be monitored.

### What steps will reproduce the problem?

killall git-annex, and then restart

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?

5.20151208-1 from jessie-backports

### Please provide any additional information below.

[[!format sh """
# If you can, paste a complete transcript of the problem occurring here.
# If the problem is with the git-annex assistant, paste in .git/annex/daemon.log


# End of transcript or log.

### Have you had any luck using git-annex before? (Sometimes we get tired of reading bug reports all day and a lil' positive end note does wonders)

Really nice tool.  Thanks Joey!
