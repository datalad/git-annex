Are you using the git-annex assistant? It's supposed to have code in it to prevent it from using dead remotes. Perhaps that is not working.

When not using the git-annex assistant, nothing prevents git-annex from trying to continue to use dead remotes. I think this is ok; maybe the dead remote is not 100% dead yet; if it is, the remote can be removed from git's configuration to prevent it being used of course.
