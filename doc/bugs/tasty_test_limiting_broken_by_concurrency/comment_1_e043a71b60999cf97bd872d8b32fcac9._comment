Well done. Btw if somebody (like me) wonders why their tasty awk patterns '/like this/' don't work with `git-annex test -p`
in Windows Git Bash, one has to remember that Git Bash is based on Cygwin/Msys and there's a Unix -> Windows
path conversion at work. You can stop that conversion by prepending a space to the awk pattern ' /like this/'
or by setting the env var MSYS_NO_PATHCONV=1. So basically the above should be formulated as follows in this arguably hobbled environment:

[[!format sh \"\"\"
$ MSYS_NO_PATHCONV=1 git-annex test -p '/concurrent get of dup key regression/ || /Init Tests/'
\"\"\"]]
