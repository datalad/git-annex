This is one of the primary known problems with v6 mode. On the page
[[todo/smudge]] that collects all such issues, it's the second item.
Basically, when git-annex gets/drops the content of the file, it
updates the work tree file, and so git thinks the file has changed.
Currently the best way to deal with it is to run `git add` on the file.
