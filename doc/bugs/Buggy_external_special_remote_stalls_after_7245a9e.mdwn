In the datalad test suite, a test involving one of our special remotes
hangs after 7245a9ed5 (Improve shutdown process for external special
remotes and external backends, 2020-11-02).  The hang depends on the
remote program creating an SSH socket but not cleaning it up on
failure.  That's being addressed on our end
(<https://github.com/datalad/datalad/pull/5151>).

While that's clearly bad handling on the part of datalad's special
remote, I'm opening this bug report in case the above stall indicates
that 7245a9ed5 brings an increased susceptibility to hanging that's
worth worrying about.  Based on 7245a9ed5's commit message, it sounds
like that resolved some hanging on Windows (and generally sounds like
a good change), so it probably makes sense keep that at the expense of
hanging that is restricted to buggy special remotes.  But I don't have
a good enough understanding of the issue to know if it's limited to
misbehaving special remotes, or if perhaps there's a way to avoid both
hangs.

In case it's helpful, here's a demo that tweaks the example special
remote to trigger a hang:

[[!format sh """
set -eu

ga_srcdir="$(realpath "${1?requires git-annex source directory as first argument}")"
host="${2?requires ssh host as second argument}"
cd "$(mktemp -d "${TMPDIR:-/tmp}"/gx-testremote-XXXXXXX)"
top="$PWD"

mkdir bin
git -C "$ga_srcdir" cat-file -p cfae74ae25a791a8dbf8b476fe17d5c6feacd8b0 \
    >bin/git-annex-remote-foo

# Open a socket in setupcreds().
cmd="ssh -fN -o ControlMaster=auto -o ControlPersist=15m -o ControlPath=$top/socket $host"
sed -i "s|setupcreds () {|&\\n\\t$cmd|" bin/git-annex-remote-foo

chmod +x bin/git-annex-remote-foo
export PATH="$top/bin:$PATH"

git annex version
git init a
(
    cd a
    git annex init main
    # This will trigger an INITREMOTE-FAILURE failure because
    # MYPASSWORD and MYLOGIN are not set.  This hangs after 7245a9ed5.
    git annex initremote d --debug \
        type=external externaltype=foo directory="$top/d" encryption=none
)
