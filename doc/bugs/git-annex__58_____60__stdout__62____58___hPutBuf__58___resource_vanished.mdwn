### Please describe the problem.

Randomly, in my terminal under a git-annex repository, I get the following message:

```
git-annex: <stdout>: hPutBuf: resource vanished (Broken pipe)
```

Note that despite this bug happens in background when I'm under a git-annex repository, I can still use explicit git-annex commands that are working well and do not crash.

### What steps will reproduce the problem?

Simply by `cd` inside one of my git-annex repositories. I think the bug is when my prompt generator (`starship`) is trying to fetch the status of the git repository under the hood.
Moreover, this bug appeared randomly without any obvious reason, possibly under all of my repositories (not a specific one).

Finally, I noticed that this bug started more or less at the same time that I did one operation:

1. Copy my git-annex repositories from one external storage A to another external storage B

2. Encrypt my external storage A

3. Copy back from external storage B to A

(But I really do not know if this is related, note that the bug is happening wherever I am on those external storage devices or on one of my local filesystems)

### Have you had any luck using git-annex before? (Sometimes we get tired of reading bug reports all day and a lil' positive end note does wonders)

This is my first post here. First, I use git-annex for both my personal files and professional datasets since around 5 years. So I have to say this wonderful piece of software helped me a lot, therefore a big thank you Joey and other contributors. ;) Second, as a reminder to myself, I really should consider to add tips to the website, since I accumulated a lot of self-wrote documentation in my notes!
