I suspect that one file has a "yt:" url recorded and the other one does not.
That's not displayed by `whereis` but you can see it if you look at the 
$key.log.web file in the git-annex branch.

That typically would happen if you used `git-annex addurl --raw`,
or added the url when yt-dlp was not working, although that doesn't explain
how the youtube title got into the filename. (Maybe importfeed?)

(I seemed to remember you having a similar problem before, and
found <https://git-annex.branchable.com/todo/yt-dlp__58___parse__47__handle___40__error__41_____34__Video_unavailable__34__/>
which seems possibly relevant to how this could have happened.)
