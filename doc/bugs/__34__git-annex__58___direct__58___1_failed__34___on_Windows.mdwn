### Please describe the problem.

When attempting to clone and use a git repository in a subdirectory several levels deep on Windows, I observe symptoms very similar to those described at http://git-annex.branchable.com/direct_mode/#comment-8feee726df4e287dd3751bc77fd1441f.  By contrast, when I attempt the same operation in a subdirectory higher up, the operation is successful.  Logs of both sessions are given below.

My suspicion is that this has to do with exceeding the maximum path length limitation (MAX_PATH) of 260 characters on Windows, as described here: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa365247.aspx.
