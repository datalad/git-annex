This is using the old hS3 library. So, each chunk is sent using a new http connection. It seems that the connection must be being closed by S3 part way through the upload of a chunk.

It may be that the new aws library somehow avoids this problem. So, a git-annex built with the `s3-aws` branch merged in may help with this bug. OTOH, that new branch makes a single http connection be reused for all the chunks in a file, so it might also make things worse.
