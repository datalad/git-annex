Additional info: I created both of the related git-annex repositories yesterday via the webapp. Then imported a number of files to each one. Then connected them via xmpp. Then created the S3 remote via the webapp so they could actually share files. I am using an IAM identity for S3 instead of my root access key; it has full S3 access (and data IS showing up in the bucket, so it's not a *simple* permissions problem).
