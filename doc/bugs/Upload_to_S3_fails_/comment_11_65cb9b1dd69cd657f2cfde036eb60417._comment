When it resumes, it will start at 0% but jump forward to the resume point pretty quickly, after verifying which chunks have already been sent.
If any full chunk gets transferred, I'd expect it to resume. This may not be very obvious it's happening for smaller files.

I have been running `git annex testremote` against S3 special remotes today, and have not managed to reproduce this problem (using either the old S3 or the new AWS libraries). It could be anything, including a problem with your network or the network between you and the S3 endpoint. Have you tried using a different S3 region?
