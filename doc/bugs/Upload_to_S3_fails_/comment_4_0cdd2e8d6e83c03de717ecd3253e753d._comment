Your version supports both new and old style chunking. Which is used depends on how the S3 remote was configured when it was set up. It can't really be changed w/o re-setting up the remote. You can check which is used by `git show git-annex:remote.log`, find the line for the UUID of the remote, and see if it has chunk= (new chunking) or chunksize= (old chunking).
