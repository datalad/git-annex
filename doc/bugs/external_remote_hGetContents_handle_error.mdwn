### Please describe the problem.

A follow on from https://git-annex.branchable.com/bugs/Failing_to_execute_bash_remotes_windows/

After noticing your note about it still being possible to run external scripts locally (don't know why I didn't try this!), I tried it. I guess this is related to the reading of the shebang?
This may be fixed already, so I'm sorry if I'm rehashing things!


### What steps will reproduce the problem?

[[!format sh """
$ git init
$ git annex init
$ cp `which git-annex-remote-rclone` .
$ git annex initremote test type=external externaltype=rclone encryption=none

initremote test
git-annex: git-annex-remote-rclone: hGetContents: illegal operation (delayed read on closed handle)
failed
git-annex: initremote: 1 failed
