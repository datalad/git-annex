I can reproduce this by running eg:

	joey@darkstar:~/tmp/torrepo>git-annex init
	init  ok
	joey@darkstar:~/tmp/torrepo>su -c "git-annex --debug enable-tor 1000"
	Password:
	git-annex: This can only be run in a git-annex repository.

This was broken by git's security fix for CVE-2022-24765. Now when the root
process tries to run `git config --list`, git does not display the local
.git/config, because it is owned by another user.
