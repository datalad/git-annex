Put in some fixes which have solved the ".git.git" problem.

Also though I reproduced the infinite loop just now, and it still is a problem
after my fixes. I had a repo with a remote foo, accessed over ssh. That remote
itself had a local remote with path "../foo.git". And foo.git had a remote with
path "../foo"

Resulting in a loop like:
	
	ssh://localhost/~/tmp/foo/../foo.git/../foo/../foo.git/../foo/../foo.git/../foo/..

Making the foo.git's remote have a path like "/home/joey/tmp/foo"
avoids the problem.

I think that the fix for this is going to need to involve path normalization.
Because this could happen with 2 git repos, that don't have git-annex uuids.
So it needs to be able to figure out that "foo/../foo.git" is the same as
"foo/../foo.git/../foo/../foo.git"
