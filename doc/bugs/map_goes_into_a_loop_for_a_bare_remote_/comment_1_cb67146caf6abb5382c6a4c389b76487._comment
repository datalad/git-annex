Produced what I think is the same bug, or related, though without the looping:

	map foo (sshing...)
	[2025-04-21 12:33:47.241024518] (Utility.Process) process [1709431] read: ssh ["localhost","-S",".git/annex/ssh/localhost","-o","ControlMaster=auto","-o","ControlPersist=yes","-n","-T","sh -c 'cd ~ && if ! cd '\"'\"'tmp/foo/../foo.git.git'\"'\"' 2>/dev/null; then cd '\"'\"'tmp/foo/../foo.git.git'\"'\"'.git; fi && git config --null --list'"
	sh: 1: cd: can't cd to tmp/foo/../foo.git.git.git
	(sshing...)
	[2025-04-21 12:33:47.249055766] (Utility.Process) process [1709434] read: ssh ["localhost","-S",".git/annex/ssh/localhost","-o","ControlMaster=auto","-o","ControlPersist=yes","-n","-T","git-annex-shell 'configlist' '/~/tmp/foo/../foo.git.git' '--debug'"]
	git-annex: failed to read git config of git repository in darkstar on /~/tmp/foo/../foo.git.git; perhaps this repository is not set up correctly or has moved

Where foo is a remote accessed via ssh, which happens to be on the same host and parent directory
as the repo I ran map in, and itself has a remote named foo that has an url of "../foo.git"

Changing the remote to be named foox with url "../foox", and 
with the bare remote now at "../foox.git", I started to see some looping too,
though it didn't loop forever:

	map . ok
	map origin (sshing...)
	ok
	map foox (sshing...)
	ok
	map origin (sshing...)
	ok
	map foox (sshing...)
	ok

One or both problems are caused by `map` using Git.Construct.fromRemotes
on the git config that is has gotten by sshing to the remote and listing its config.
Git.Construct really is written to operate on local repos, and fromRemotes
ends up calling Git.Construct.fromPath, which checks doesDirectoryExist ... locally.

That is just not ever going to work correctly and map will need to use something else
to get the paths to the remotes.
