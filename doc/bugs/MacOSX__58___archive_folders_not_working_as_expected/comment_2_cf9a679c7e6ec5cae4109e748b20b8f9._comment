If this is OSX specific, which it seems to be (I've tested archive folders
working as expected plenty on Linux), it might have to do with the
assistant not seeing an event for the file being added when it's renamed
to/from the archive folder. In the --debug log, it looks like the file
got deleted but never added back.

If this is the case, `git annex status` should show the file as not being
checked into git.
