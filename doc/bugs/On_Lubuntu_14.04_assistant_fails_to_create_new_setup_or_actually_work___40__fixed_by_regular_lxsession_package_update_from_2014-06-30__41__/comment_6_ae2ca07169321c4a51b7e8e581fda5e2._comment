Since this is a little strange, I just looked again at the machine.
Your software attracts archivist kind of git-annex user, so don't be surprise that I kept logs of the machine.

Short answer: **confirmed it was a LXDE issue, now fixed**.

## From what date has git-annex started to work ?

	git log | grep Date:

    (many other lines...)
    Date:   Mon Jun 30 21:43:49 2014 +0200
    Date:   Mon Jun 30 21:42:07 2014 +0200
    Date:   Mon Jun 30 21:38:22 2014 +0200
    Date:   Sun Jun 8 14:34:13 2014 +0200
    Date:   Sun Jun 8 14:28:48 2014 +0200
    Date:   Sat Jun 7 16:21:06 2014 +0200

So I tried to enable it on June 7, reported bug on June 8.
The the machine was used on a regular basis but git-annex assistant was ineffective.
Then it started working as expected from June 30th.

## Any package install near June 30th ?

Updates installed regularly.

    cd /var/log ; zgrep -h \" installed.*\" dpkg.log* | grep '2014-0[67]-..' -o | sort | uniq -c

Which packages were installed on 2014-06-30 ?

    cd /var/log ; zgrep -h \" installed.*\" dpkg.log* | grep '2014-06-(29|30)' -E

And indeed [0.4.9.2+git20140410-0ubuntu1.1 : “lxsession” package : Ubuntu](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/lxsession/0.4.9.2+git20140410-0ubuntu1.1)

So it was indeed a lxde bug.

I added a comment there (#69) which may serve as a hint to other people having not updated their system. [Bug #1308348 “network settings indicator missing from panel” : Bugs : “lxsession” package : Ubuntu](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/lxsession/+bug/1308348)
