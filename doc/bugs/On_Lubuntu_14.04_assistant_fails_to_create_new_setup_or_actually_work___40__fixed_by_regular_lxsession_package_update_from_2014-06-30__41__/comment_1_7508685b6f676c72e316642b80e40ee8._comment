It sounds rather like the webapp is failing to create the repository. Although I would expect for it to show an error message in red beneath the repository path. OTOH, it also sounds like something (either the webapp or eg a manual git-annex run) set up a git-annex repository in ~/Documents.

git-annex will be started automatically on login as long as `~/.config/git-annex/autostart` lists a repository to use. If that file exists and contains ~/Documents then we'll know that the webapp successfully set up the repository.
