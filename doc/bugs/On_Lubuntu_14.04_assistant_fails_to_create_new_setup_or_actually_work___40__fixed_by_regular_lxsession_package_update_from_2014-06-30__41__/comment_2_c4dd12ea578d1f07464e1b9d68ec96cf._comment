> It sounds rather like the webapp is failing to create the repository. Although I would expect for it to show an error message in red beneath the repository path. 

No message in red at any time.

> OTOH, it also sounds like something (either the webapp or eg a manual git-annex run) set up a git-annex repository in ~/Documents.

There was none before the webapp.
After the webapp failure, there was one, but without any file.
Only after I manually did git annex add, it looked \"unlocked\".

> git-annex will be started automatically on login as long as ~/.config/git-annex/autostart lists a repository to use. If that file exists and contains ~/Documents then we'll know that the webapp successfully set up the repository.

Can't check now, the machine is off.  Should check soon.  Thanks.
