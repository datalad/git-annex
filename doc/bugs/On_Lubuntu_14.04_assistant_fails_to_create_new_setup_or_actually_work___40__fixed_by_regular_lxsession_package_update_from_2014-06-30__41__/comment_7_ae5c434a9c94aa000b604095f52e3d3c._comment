That lubuntu bug explains why git-annex would not autostart on login.

However, that does not explain the original problem description, which was that the `Make Repository` button seemed to make a repository but not switch to the webapp running in that repository. In the case of making a new repository, the webapp is started in it by git-annex, not by the desktop autostart mechanism.

Can you reproduce the original problem?
