The problem is that there's no way for preferred content expressions to specify that a file is wanted just because some old version of the file is (or was) present.

It's not clear to me how that could be added to the preferred content expressions in an efficient way.

It might be possible to hack `git annex sync --content` and the assistant to look at incoming merges, and queue downloads of newer versions of files before merging.

Also being discussed at <https://github.com/datalad/datalad/issues/6>.
