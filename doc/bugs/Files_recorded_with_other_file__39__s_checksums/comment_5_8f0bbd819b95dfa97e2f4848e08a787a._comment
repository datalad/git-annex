Following up a bit - I had blown away the repos that were in use for this, but based on what I logged here, I can confirm that at least the files I mentioned with conflicts had the same size and mtime.

I may yet want to use ignoreinodes=yes.  Eventually I want to be feeding git-annex from zfs clones to get a guaranteed stable source at any given moment, and I'm not really sure what that will do to inodes (it should, at minimum, have a different device number, I would assume).
