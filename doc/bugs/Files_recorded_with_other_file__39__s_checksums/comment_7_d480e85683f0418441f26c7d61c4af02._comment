Well, it seems that you have confirmed that the bug you were seeing is the
known and already fixed problem involving files that had the same size and
mtime.

I suggest filing a new bug report for the other problem, since it does not
seem like the same problem. I don't like to have to re-read long threads
about unrelated problems to tease out the "current" problem than a bug
report is talking about. 1 bug report per problem saves everyone time and
confusion.
