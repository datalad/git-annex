How much ram did it use up?

The fact that the S3 bucket is versioned and that there are many versions
seems very relevant to me. Importing lists all the files in the bucket, and
traverses all versions and lists all the files in each version. That builds
up a data structure in memory, which could be very large in this case. If
you have around 150 versions total, the number of files in the data
structure would be effectively three million.

If the same thing works for you with `versioning=no` set, that will confirm
the source of the problem.

It only gets filtered down to the wanted files in a subsequent pass.
Filtering on the fly would certainly help with your case, but not with a
case where someone wants to import all 22000 files.

Rather, I'd be inclined to try to fix this by making importableHistory into
a callback so it can request one historical tree at a time. Similar to how
ImportableContentsChunked works.
