I looked into filtering to preferred content on the fly. I was able to
adapt listImportableContents to allow that to be done optionally. But of
the remotes that support tree import, only directory and S3 would be able
to use it. And I've not yet managed to implement it for S3. My incomplete 
work on this is in the `importtreefilter` branch.
