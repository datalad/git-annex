$ git annex uninit
git-annex: what.foo points to annexed content, but is not checked into git.
Perhaps this was left behind by an interrupted git annex add?
Not continuing with uninit; either delete or git annex add the file and retry.
```
What should I do?

Honestly, I'm happy with git-annex so far, I'm just thinking that I need to re-init with `annex.tune.objecthashlower=true` because my other computer is windows.

Thanks!
