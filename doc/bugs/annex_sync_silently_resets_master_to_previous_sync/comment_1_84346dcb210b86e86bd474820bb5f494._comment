Simplified test case:

	git init tc
	cd tc
	git-annex init
	echo 1 > foo
	git-annex add
	git commit -m add
	git annex adjust --unlock
	git checkout master
	rm foo
	echo 2 > foo
	git-annex add
	git commit -m "this commit will be lost"
	git checkout 'adjusted/master(unlocked)'
	git annex adjust --unlock  # or git-annex sync
	git log master

What an unfortunate oversight! And it's not a reversion, it's been there
since the beginning of adjusted branches.

git-annex adjust should display a warning message in that situation,
since the original branch has diverged from the adjusted branch.

And git-annex sync should be able to resolve the divergence by
auto-merging the changes from the original branch into the adjusted
branch.
