Hmm, the arch version info you posted originally shows the same version
of the DAV library as I have here, so I had assumed it was not a
version problem. May be something else in the dependency tree below
DAV though.

Are you sure it's not an intermittent problem; does it consistently fail
with the arch build and work with the standalone build?

Also, which arch build of git-annex are you using?
