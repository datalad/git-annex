Looks related to the other bug report, it's failing creating the
directory for the temp file at the top of the repository, which
already exists.

So, the fix I just committed to fix the other bug report may have
fixed this too.. Can you test?

(It's also possible that the nonsensicalness of "MKCOL ."
means it's not widely supported, or may even be out of the webdav spec
entirely. The fix for the other bug report avoids that behavior.)
