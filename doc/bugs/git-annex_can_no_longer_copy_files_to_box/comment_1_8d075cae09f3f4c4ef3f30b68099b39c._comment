I'm not reproducing the problem here.

The only change recent that affected storing files in any
way was the temporary location change. But I don't see how that
would lead to such a failure. 

I've improved the webdav error message to include information about the
request that failed. That should help with debugging the problem. An
updated autobuild will be available within an hour or two.
