It's interesting you reproduced it when building with stack. I'm a bit
confused because in your other bug report, you seemed to have git-annex
built with stack working without this bug?

In any case, IIRC stack will use haskell libraries installed system-wide in
some cases, so it may be picking up whatever the problimatic library is
from Arch Linux.

If you can reproduce it with stack on a system that does not have a
system-wide ghc installed, I'd think I should also be able to build with
stack and reproduce it..

Also, I've just made --debug log all webdav operations, which should help
track down what operation is failing..
