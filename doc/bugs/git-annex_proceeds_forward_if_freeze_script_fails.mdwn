### Please describe the problem.

Somewhat not relevant details: We have freeze/thaw scripts configured at the level of a user

When operating on POSIX compliant filesystem (not ACL nfs4 one), our freeze/thaw scripts fail -- exit with non-0:

```

```

but git-annex seems to not care and proceeds forward

```

even though it is like a "feature" for us, so that the same freeze/thaw could be specified at user level, I think generally this is not a desired behavior -- if underlying freeze/thaw script fails, git-annex also should fail!
