### Please describe the problem.

This is a followup on [[bugs/internal_server_error:_unknown_UUID_on_webapp]]. In that issue, webapps previous to 20130929 would crash with `internal server error: unknown UUID`. This was fixed at that date, but some problems remain, namely that the remote that is recognized on the commandline doesn't show up in the webapp.

`markov` is able to push to `marcos`, but not the reverse because `markov` is hidden behind a NAT. `git annex sync` seems to do the right thing accordingly on both ends (which is: `marcos` doesn't try to push to `markov` but `markov` pushes to `marcos`).

### What steps will reproduce the problem?

See [[bugs/internal_server_error:_unknown_UUID_on_webapp]]. I didn't do any further changes other than upgrade `git-annex` on both ends.

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?

`marcos` is now running `Version: 4.20131105-g8efdc1a Build flags: Assistant Webapp Pairing Testsuite S3 WebDAV Inotify DBus XMPP DNS Feeds Quvi TDFA CryptoHash`

`markov` is now running the wheezy backport, `4.20131002~bpo70+1`.

### Please provide any additional information below.

#### On `marcos`

Here's the output of `git annex status` on `marcos`:

Here's a screenshot of the idle webapp on marcos:

You can clearly see that the webapp doesn't see the `markov` remote.

When `markov` transfers stuff, `marcos` sees the transfers happening, but marks it as going to the `unknown` remote:

Clicking on that link is what was previously triggering [[bugs/internal_server_error:_unknown_UUID_on_webapp]] but now yields a "Unknown remote" error.

#### On `markov`:

Here is a screenshot from `markov` that shows *it* knows about both repositories and seem to behave properly:

And here's the output of `git annex status` on markov:

Finally, note that you sometimes see `desktop008` above: it turns out I am running `git annex` from my workstation, which NFS-mounts the `/home` directory of `markov` into `/srv/musique`.  --[[anarcat]]

Yesterday, I made the webapp register ssh remotes it creates. 
They then show up in the webapp when run in a repository where that ssh
remote is not enabled.

You can also manually register a ssh remote. First set up the git remote
as usual. Then run `git annex initremote type=git name=foo
location=$url`.
