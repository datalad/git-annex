git-annex does not contain any calls to the "mktemp" command.

So, it must be your external special remote that uses that command.
It's up to the authors of external special remotes to make them run
portably on whatever OS's they want to support. Probably if you mention
this to the author of whatever external special remote you're using (you
neglected to say what one it is in your bug report!), they will easily be
able to fix it.

git-annex is not going to get in the business of bundling a bunch of stuff
that it does not depend on, sorry.
