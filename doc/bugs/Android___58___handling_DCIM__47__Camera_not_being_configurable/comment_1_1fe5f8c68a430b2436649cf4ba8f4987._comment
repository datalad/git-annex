I guess that this bug report is not about the DCIM/Camera location not being configurable, since that is up to Android, not git-annex. 

So, it seems to be a bug report about a file descriptor leak. It would be helpful, if you can reproduce the leak, to look at /proc/$pid/fd/ to see what files git-annex has open.
