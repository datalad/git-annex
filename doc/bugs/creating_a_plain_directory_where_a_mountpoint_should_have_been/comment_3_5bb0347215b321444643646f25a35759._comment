It's possible, even likely, that there were indeed more directories and I didn't notice because they were hidden and I just looked at them with a vanilla \"ls\" command with no flags like \"-a\".

So it's probably exactly what you're thinking --t here was something going on, a transfer queued or something, that I didn't realize was happening and I removed it and it went and created the directory as if it were there.
