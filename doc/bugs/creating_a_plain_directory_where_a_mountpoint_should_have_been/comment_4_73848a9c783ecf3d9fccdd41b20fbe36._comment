I saw this too, today. The repo in my case was created via the webapp, using the 'usb key' option.
I was messing about with deleting repos and had turned off synchronisation for the repo on the key as I didn't have it inserted.

I only just stumbled on this bug report after removing the repository from the key entirely, so it's difficult to define the reproduction steps.

* create a 'usb key' repo via webapp, transfer type
* let it sync
* disable sync
* change a file in another repo, so there is something to sync
* unmount key, unplug key
* turn on sync again - should see 'failed ot sync with ...' in webapp dashboard
* reinsert key
* let it sync
* unplug key without properly unmounting
* change a file in another repo, so there is something to sync

I just did this. The key was mounting at /Volumes/VERBATIM4. Just after unplugging without unmounting, that directory was gone.
When I made the change that could be synced, I got a /Volumes/VERBATIM4 directory. The directory tree structure is similar to but different
from the structure on the usb key, see below.

Now when I try to plug it in again os/x will spot the potential conflict and mount the key at /Volumes/VERBATIM4\ 1.

If I instead rm -rf /Volumes/VERBATIM4 and then replug the usb key, everything syncs as expected.
