### Please describe the problem.

Some dependencies of `git-annex` don't have viable releases for ghc-9.2.2 (aws, bloomfilter).

```
cabal v2-build
Resolving dependencies...
cabal: Could not resolve dependencies:
[__0] trying: bloomfilter-2.0.1.0 (user goal)

[__8] skipping: aeson-2.0.2.0, aeson-2.0.1.0, aeson-2.0.0.0 (has the same
characteristics that caused the previous version to fail: excluded by
constraint '>=0.6 && <1.6' from 'aws')
...
```

### What steps will reproduce the problem?

`cabal v2-build [--allow-newer]`

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?

I checked out HEAD as of `b25bfecb1`. Building it on OpenBSD with ghc-9.2.2.


### Please provide any additional information below.

Building with `--allow-newer` first points at `bloomfilter` which is a [known problem with a patch](https://github.com/bos/bloomfilter/pull/20). The next problem is with `aws` and this appears to [also be a known issue](https://github.com/aristidb/aws/issues/275) which also [has a patch](https://github.com/aristidb/aws/pull/277).

### Have you had any luck using git-annex before? 

Yes, very much so. It works great as an OpenBSD port when built with ghc-8.10.6.

### Minor fix is required to git-annex

Once I apply this little fix to `git-annex` and the two patches referenced above, the code type-checks.

```patch
diff --git a/Types/Export.hs b/Types/Export.hs
index a5cb173e5..2d5419b91 100644

```

I also see all but one tests pass, but I'm pretty sure the same test used to fail with the older compiler:
