git-annex builds with stack have used tls-2.0.x since August. I think many
other builds are still using older tls from before this change, eg Debian
is still on tls-1.8.0.

So it's possible that more outdated servers will be causing problems as
things continue to upgrade. It seems worth leaving this bug open for now.

Also it seems pretty clear that TLS 1.2 without EMS is insecure, but I
don't know if the insecurity is of a kind that is likely to affect
git-annex users. Bearing in mind that git-annex can be used to upload
sensitive information to HTTP servers, caution is warrented.
