Finally ran into this myself, and I observed several podcast hosts still
not supporting EMS even now.

Implemented a config to solve this:

	git config annex.security.allow-insecure-https tls-1.2-no-EMS

I do caution against setting this globally for security reasons. At least not
without understanding the security implications, which I can't say I do.

Even setting it in a single repo could affect other
connections by git-annx to eg, API endpoints used for storage.

Personally, I am setting it only when importing feeds from those hosts:

	git -c annex.security.allow-insecure-https=tls-1.2-no-EMS annex importfeed
