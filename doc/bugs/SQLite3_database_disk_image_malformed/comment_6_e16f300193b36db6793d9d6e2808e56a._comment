> A useful thing to display might be the path to the corrupted database file and advice to remove it?

Good idea to display the path. I've made that change.

I don't think I want to make git-annex suggest deleting sqlite databases
anytime sqlite crashes for any reason. While they are safe to delete,
that encourages users to shrug and move on and tends to normalize any
problem with sqlite. In reality, problems with sqlite are very rare,
and I'd like to hear about them and understand them.
