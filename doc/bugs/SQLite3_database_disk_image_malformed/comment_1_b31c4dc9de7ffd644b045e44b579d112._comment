Hey,

I hit this again today, running 10.20230126-3, so I upgraded to 10.20250115-1~bpo12+1. New error messages, excellent! Including: The SQL trying to be run, and the error from sqlite.

This included \"disk I/O error\" from sqlite. Further investigation, and the volume was out of space ðŸ¤¦. Don't know if that was the case when I first hit this or not.

Cheers,
Andrew
