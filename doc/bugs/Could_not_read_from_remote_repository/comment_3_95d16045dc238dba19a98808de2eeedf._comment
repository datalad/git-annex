I was seeing similar error messages, until I registered for a different XMPP account at jabber.de and started using that instead of my gmail.com account.

My current suspicion is that it could be Google performing throttling on their XMPP service. See here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1843837/what-is-the-throttling-rate-that-gtalk-applies-to-xmpp-messages
