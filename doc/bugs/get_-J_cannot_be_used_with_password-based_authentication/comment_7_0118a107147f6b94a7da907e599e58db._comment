What about when `GIT_SSH` is used? `prepSocket` is not used then,
and git-annex can only use the `GIT_SSH` interface to ssh to the host.
So, the approach above won't work.

git-annex could then try to use `GIT_SSH` to ssh to the host and run eg `true`,
in hopes that `GIT_SSH` is enabling ssh connection caching and that will
get the ssh connection set up. If `GIT_SSH` is not enabling connection
caching, that might add an additional password prompt, and not avoid
other password prompts from overlapping.
