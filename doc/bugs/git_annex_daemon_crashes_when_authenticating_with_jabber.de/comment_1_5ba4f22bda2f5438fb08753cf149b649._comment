I was able to use that server from git-annex on Linux successfully.

I also tried on OSX, which appears to be the OS you're using. The assistant didn't crash. I may not have exactly replicated what you did though.

Can you enable debug logging in Configuration -> Preferences and try to do this again, and send any parts of the log that mention XMPP?
