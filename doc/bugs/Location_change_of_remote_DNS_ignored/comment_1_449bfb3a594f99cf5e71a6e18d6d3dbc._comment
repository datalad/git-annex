**self-edit**:
Changed location of .git/config once again as described but instead of re-starting assistant, I ran \"git-annex sync\" which ended with no errors. After that, assistant started correctly and also had the corrected remote location. From my point of view, this thread has been resolved - even though I wonder what changed the value back to the old one in the first place.
