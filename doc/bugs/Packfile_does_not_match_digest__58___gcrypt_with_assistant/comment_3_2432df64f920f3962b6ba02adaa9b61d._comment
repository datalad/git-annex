Ok, so definitely not a bug in git-annex then.

`get_verify_decrypt_pack` downloads an encrypted pack file, and then
uses gpg to hash the pack file and compares this to the hash
encoded in the name of the pack file.

So, this could happen if the pack files in the gcrypt remote have gotten
the wrong data into them. Or it could be a bug of some kind in
git-remote-gcrypt.
