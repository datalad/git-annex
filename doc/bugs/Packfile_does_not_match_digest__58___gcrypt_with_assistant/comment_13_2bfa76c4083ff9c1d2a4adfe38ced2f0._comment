Hi folks,

I no longer use git-annex so I can't comment directly on this.  However, in some testing with git-remote-gcrypt, I came across an issue where changes seem to be lost.  In short, every git push behaves as if --force were given.  Details in [Debian but #877464](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=877464).
