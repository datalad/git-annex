That error message is certainly not coming from git-annex. It sounds like a
git error message, but I don't find it in the current git source code.

What it sounds like is some form of corruption of the git repository,
probably to a pack file. Since git-annex doesn't have anything to do with
writing such files, it's hard to see how this could be a bug in git-annex.

This kind of corruption problem tends to happen when a disk loses data,
perhaps having to do with an unclean shutdown. Or perhaps it received
bad git repository data from the VPS.

Suggest you run `git fsck` and if it reports problems, you may be ableo
to fix them by running `git annex repair`.
