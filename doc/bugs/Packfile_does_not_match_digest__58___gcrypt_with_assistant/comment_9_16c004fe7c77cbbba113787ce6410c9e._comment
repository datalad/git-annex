I'm the git-remote-gcrypt maintainer, but as it stands it's not really possible to do anything about this bug without steps to reliably reproduce the corrupted/unencrypted remote repository.

I have been using git-remote-gcrypt with git-annex and with plain git repos for more than two years and I have never encountered anything like this issue.  So there's no starting point to work on a fix for the issue.
