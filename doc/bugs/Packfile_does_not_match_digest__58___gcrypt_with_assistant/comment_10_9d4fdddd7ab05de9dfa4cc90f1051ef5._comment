@Don and @pot, did you actually see un-encrypted data end up in the gcrypt
repository? Or by "same issue" do you mean you saw the same error message,
perhaps due to a very different cause?

@jgoerzen, when you say that the gcrypt reposotory had an "unencrypted
index", are you referring to a regular git index file, or to a pack's .idx
file?

It would be very strange if a gcrypt repository had an index file.
I've never been able to use git-remote-gcrypt with a non-bare repository,
and bare repositories don't normally have index files.
