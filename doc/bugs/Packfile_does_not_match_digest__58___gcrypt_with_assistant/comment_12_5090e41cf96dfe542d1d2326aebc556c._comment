Not sure how I did it, but I have 2 repos that give me the same error. (Perhaps it happened when killing the assistant in the middle of a sync? No idea…)

However I \"solved\" the issue for one repo:

1. cloned the gcrypt remote to a temporary directory
2. removed all the (encrypted) files with `git rm`, committed that, and pushed it (the repo is hosted on Gitlab and I can't just remove the branch or do something like that)
3. removed the `gcrypt-id| from my `.git/config`
4. ran `git annex sync` again

And voilà! It works :)

I don't have any content in this remote, only metadata, so it's easy to do. But I still don't know what caused this.
