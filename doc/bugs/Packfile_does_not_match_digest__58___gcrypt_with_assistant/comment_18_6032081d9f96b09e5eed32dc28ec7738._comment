Hi, I have stumbled upon this specific bug today too.

I use `git-annex`: `10.20240927-3` (latest on Manjaro) with `git-remote-gcrypt`: `1.5-1` (latest at the time) and I now have the same issue.

    $ git push <remote> master 
    gcrypt: Decrypting manifest
    gpg: Signature made jeu. 16 janv. 2025 18:56:55 CET
    gpg:                using EDDSA key ***
    gpg: Good signature from \"*** <***>\" [ultimate]
    gcrypt: Due to a longstanding bug, this push implicitly has --force.
    gcrypt: Consider explicitly passing --force, and setting
    gcrypt: gcrypt's require-explicit-force-push git config key.
    gcrypt: Repacking remote <remote>, ...
    gcrypt: Packfile *** does not match digest!
    fatal: early EOF
    error: failed to push some refs to 'gcrypt::ssh://librarian@<ip>:<port>/~/library.git'

I tried to reproduce the issue and it seems that it is easy to force this to happen if
- you have a `git annex assistant` running in the annex  
- copy a large directory (I used a `.flac` music album, 2.1Gi) to the annex so that it is uploaded to the `gcrypt` remote automatically  
- issue a `git annex sync --content` while the assistant is trying to upload the content to the remote
