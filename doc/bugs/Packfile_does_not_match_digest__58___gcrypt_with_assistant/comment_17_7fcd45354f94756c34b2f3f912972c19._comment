Just to add one more data point â€“ I ran into the situation after a kernel oops had caused my rootfs to become read-only. So maybe related to the \"out of inodes\" issue reported above.

~~~
$ git push
gcrypt: Decrypting manifest
gpg: error getting version from 'scdaemon': No SmartCard daemon

gpg:                using RSA key XXX

XXX is obviously my redactions. I was not running the assistant, just plain git-annex.

There was no plaintext on the remote and the only way for me to recover was to nuke the remote repo.

I kept copies of both repos, though I unfortunately cannot share the unencrypted one.
