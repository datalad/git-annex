Although I believe Joey's analysis is correct, I want to interject a caution: while investigating this issue on my own system, I discovered that a gcrypt remote has an unencrypted pack file and unencrypted index, which somehow contained actual data of mine.  I would consider it a git-annex bug that data (file contents) wound up in a pack file (this is a git-annex assistant repo) but a gcrypt bug that it made it there unencrypted.
