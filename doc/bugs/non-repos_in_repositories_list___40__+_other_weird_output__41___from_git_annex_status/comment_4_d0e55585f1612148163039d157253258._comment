The 4201 dangling blobs is a little bit strange, although it could certianly happen in some normal scenarios.
Overall, your repository seems to be ok except for this weird data in the one file. I do not anticipate the extra garbage causing any problems at all.

To track this down, we need to find the commit that added the garbage. One way, assuming you're using indirect mode, is to `git checkout git-annex; git blame uuid.log` and `git show` the commit that added the garbage. If you're using direct mode, you should first `git clone` the repository and do that in the clone.
