I think that the whole `git show $sha` for each commit will provide useful context.

I want to understand what happened here, because there are multiple weird things going on, and it's important to root cause this sort of bug.

What version of git-annex is on the rPi and how was it installed? Is there a simple operation you can do that segfaults every time?
