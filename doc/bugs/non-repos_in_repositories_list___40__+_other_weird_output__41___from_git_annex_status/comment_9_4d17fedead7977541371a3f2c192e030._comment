Here's an excerpt of the first commit where uuid.log got garbage into it. It seems that some other log files got garbage put in them before this point, and it will be interesting to see if every time new garbage gets in it's doing a \"(recovery from race)\" commit. If so, that would point pretty strongly at that code as a culprit.

(Of course, it's intriguing that the race recovery commit itself seemed to encounter a race and this repeated dozens of times. An exceptionally unlikely thing to happen if everything is behaving correctly.)

Looks a lot like a whole git commit object was union merged into the file, doesn't it?
