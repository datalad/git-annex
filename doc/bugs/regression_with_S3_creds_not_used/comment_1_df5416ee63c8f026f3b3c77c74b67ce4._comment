I tried reproducing this with the current version of git-annex on windows,
and didn't see the problem. The creds file was used when the AWS_*
environment variables were not set.

What was the version of git-annex that was working before this reversion?

Does the creds files corresponding to the uuid of your S3 remote exist?
Does it contain 2 lines, for the access key and secret key, respectively?

The webapp failure message seems to indicate that git-annex is has found
creds, but they somehow have the wrong values. Does the s3ErrorAccessKeyId
that you redacted match the access key that you told git-annex to use?
(Note that it should be ok to show the s3 access key as long as you don't
also show what the secret key is AFAIK.)
