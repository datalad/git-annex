In restagePointerFiles, isunmodified's call to genInodeCache is returning
Nothing, and so it does not try to restage the file.

The path to the annexed file includes "l√§p", and that non-ascii
character is causing the problem. If I rename that to "lap", the problem
goes away.

Printing out the OsPath, I see `"l\195\164p"`. That seems wrong for
Windows, where it should be using UTF-16. Calling `fromOsPath` on it to
make a RawFilePath yields `"l\195\131\194\164p"` which is certainly wrong,
and explains why genInodeCache, which does that conversion, is failing.

So the question is how the OsPath is being constructed with the wrong
encoding. In this case, it's coming from streamRestageLog.
Which uses streamLogFileUnsafe. Which does not set the filesystem encoding
when reading the log file. So that's the bug. I'm not sure if this bug is
actually Windows specific, although the use of UTF16 on windows may be
helping trigger a problem with it.

Anyway, fixed it!
