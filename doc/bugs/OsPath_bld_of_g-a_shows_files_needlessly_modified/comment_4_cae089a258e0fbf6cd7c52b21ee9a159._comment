@Joey: you've got email. Thanks in advance for taking a look at my problem. I forgot
to mention in the email that you really need to comment or remove the line with
`git config core.autocrlf false` from my init script (init-git-annex.cmd|.sh) or
you're going to get spurious modified files in git status. I believe the default
is `core.autocrlf` set to true systemwide in Git for Windows. Somehow that default
is what Git for Windows is most \"comfortable\" with, although personally I hate
that it always \"cooks\" my newlines, so to speak. :)
