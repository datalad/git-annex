I've reproduced this.

Note that running `git-annex add` on the affected files will clear up the
problem. It manages to restage the file, and as there is no modification,
is otherwise a no-op.

As a first analysis, I looked as annex.debug output between the two
versions of git-annex. There were no differences other than pid numbers and
git-annex branch shas.

Also, after running `git-annex get` with the bad git-annex, running `git
status` with the good git-annex in path did not correct the problem.

My current guess is that restagePointerFiles has changed its behavior in
the filenames it sends to git update-index. In particular the comment about
"update-index is documented as picky" about filepaths suggests a small and
otherwise ok change to a file path could cause this breakage.
