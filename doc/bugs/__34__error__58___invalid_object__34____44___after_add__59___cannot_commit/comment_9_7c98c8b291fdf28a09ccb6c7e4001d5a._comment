Any ideas? I noticed one alternative way (cf. the reset workaround
above) to make «git annex add» work again is by deleting
.git/annex/index*. Is this safe?

In both repos, I had not even staged annex additions before the index
was corrupted; the corruption must somehow have been left-over from
earlier actions, altough all previous additions succeeded at the time,
before both repositories mysteriously stopped working (in the context
of backend-migration).

I still have the original snapshots around if you’d like to debug
this. As noted, «git fsck» succeeds, and all the block-level checksums
check out, so the problem can’t be on the block device or file-system
level.
