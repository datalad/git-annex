I just checked my other large git annex repo and noticed that here too I could no longer add files to the annex. The same observations as above apply. Here too on the tip of the git-anenx branch I had one huge commit in which I dropped the last of the unused WORM keys from another remote. Resetting the git-annex branch to git-annex~1 allowed me to make additions again, even though the reset tip was subsequently merged in again from the remote tracking branch.
