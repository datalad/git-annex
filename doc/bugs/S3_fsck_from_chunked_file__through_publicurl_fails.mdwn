### Please describe the problem.

When running fsck (fast or slow) from an S3 remote that has anonymous access and git-annex publicurl set, it fails only on the files that get chunked into multiple parts because they exceed the configured chunk size for the remote.


### What steps will reproduce the problem?

- create repo
- annex a file
- set AWS creds as env vars
- initremote S3 special remote with chunk size smaller than the file size and publicurl
- push data (authenticated) to the S3 remote, ensure it get chunked.
- unset AWS auth vars (and remote .git/annex/creds if necessary)
- fsck from remote should fail on chunked file


### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?

git-annex version: 10.20250417-gfd493804c004f7facb4b99d4bf21ed49a081c5cf

### Have you had any luck using git-annex before? (Sometimes we get tired of reading bug reports all day and a lil' positive end note does wonders)

Yes indeed! :D
