I checked the evilspliced tmp/androidtree/Assistant/WebApp/Types.hs, and the bootstrap.css there ends correctly, nothing weird appended.

The TH generated for this:

<pre>
       (\"css/bootstrap.css\", 
        GHC.IO.unsafePerformIO
          (Data.ByteString.Unsafe.unsafePackAddressLen
             121220
             file_content_omitted)
</pre>

That looks right, in particular the size is the same as the number of bytes in the file.

Hmm.. To double-check, I edited the file so that the string containing the content of this file was defined in foo.

<pre>
*Main> length foo
113023
</pre>

This might be innocuous; there are some unicode characters in the string that encode to multiple bytes. OTOH, if you see exactly 8197 bytes of extra garbage appended, I think we have our culprit.
