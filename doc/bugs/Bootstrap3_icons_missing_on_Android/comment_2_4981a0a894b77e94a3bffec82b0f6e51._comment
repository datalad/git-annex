I've verified that the assistant is serving up the files, such as http://127.0.0.1:$port/static/fonts/glyphicons-halflings-regular.svg

I've verified that the files it's serving have the right content.

This seems to only leave the likely explanation that the android web browser doesn't support the technology bootstrap 3 is using for its icons. This is svg, plus ttf, plus Embedded OpenType and Web Open Font Format. (I suppose it uses different ones on different browsers.)

I'm surprised that bootstrap would be using web fonts technology if it's not supported on Android, or wouldn't have a fallback to the plain old image method old versions of bootstrap used.

I have found some bootstrap bugs about icons not showing up on Android, like this one <https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/issues/10106> ... but those are about specific icons not showing up due to unicode issues. Not about all icons failing to show up.
