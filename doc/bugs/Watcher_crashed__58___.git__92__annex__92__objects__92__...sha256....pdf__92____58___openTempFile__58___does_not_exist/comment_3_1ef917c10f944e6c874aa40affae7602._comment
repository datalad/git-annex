Sorry, Joey, but I don't have the details of the version which crahed on us, and we updated afterwards : no time to try and reproduce fully : really busy producing videos, and anxious to find a solution on backing up videos reliably (which by the way I solved like this : https://www-public.tem-tsp.eu/~berger_o/weblog/2015/11/26/handling-video-files-produced-for-a-mooc-on-windows-with-git-and-git-annex/).

I don't see however how we could have touched the contents of the .git/ : we were only doing Windows explorer actions : dragging files here and there, renaming dirs, saving stuff in Camtasia, but all inside subdirs of the git clone.

Sorry for the poor quality of the report, but we were in a real hurry and had to find solutions without distracting us from the main topic : video editing :-/
