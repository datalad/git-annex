If an unlocked (as known to annex) file is dropped locally, it is still present on the file system as a regular file. So git-annex unaware tool could happily append to it without realizing that it is changing a file which contains no data, but rather a git link of git-annex.  Then `git commit` would silently (!!!) commit such a change.

<summary>here is a reproducer</summary> 

```shell
#!/bin/bash

cd "$(mktemp -d ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/dl-XXXXXXX)"
set -eu

git init
git annex init

set -x
git annex addurl --file 123 http://onerussian.com/tmp/123
git annex unlock 123 
git commit -m 'commit 123 unlocked' 123

git annex drop 123
cat 123

# git annex knows that the content is gone!
git annex list

echo "more crap" >> 123
git commit -m 'Added crap' 123

# how probable it is that the user DOES want gitlink on top of that file?
cat 123
git show

```

although could be considered a user error, I feel that also git annex could add a guard that while smudging if file was not locally present, beginning of the content is the previous git link, something went awry and at least issuing some warning (if possible) could be due and help prevent some data loss where expected to grow file would be trimmed and previous content possibly dropped.

may be situation is even more "dire" because git-annex still considers this file "annexed" (according to `git annex list`) although not present locally.
