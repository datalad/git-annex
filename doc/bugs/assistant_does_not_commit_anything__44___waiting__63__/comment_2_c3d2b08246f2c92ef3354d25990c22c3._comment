It's pretty easy to replicate this behavior:

	cat > .git/index.lock

And while that process is still running, start the assistant.

It might be some other ".lock" file or perhaps `.git/gc.pid` that a process
has open for write. The assistant does not want to start running with a
stale git lock file, which is a pretty common problem given the way that
git lock files work. So when the lock file exists, it waits for it to have
no writers, before removing it.
