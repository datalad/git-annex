It's treating `*.lock` as git lock files. Any other filename won't have the
problem.

[[!commit 635c9a1549f28992b6ae370f6e8687170c971525]] has a rationalle for
that, that git has other lock files than index.lock. It does seem to me to
be doubtful that any other stale git lock than index.lock would cause
significant trouble to the assistant.

But this code is supposed to deal with stale locks. This lock is not
stale; it has a process holding it open. So the assistant has no
reason to wait on it. I've removed the wait loop.
