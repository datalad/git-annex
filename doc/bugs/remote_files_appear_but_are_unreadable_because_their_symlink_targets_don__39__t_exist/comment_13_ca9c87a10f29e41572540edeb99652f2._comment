I'm more interested in fixing core problems, like why it was not able to find git-annex-shell, than in fixing bugs in the web UI that follow on from those problems. 

When you're using the standalone tarball, it's supposed to set up `~/.ssh/git-annex-shell` to point to wherever you've unpacked the tarball. The assistant does this the first time you run it, and any time it sees the file is out of date.
I've tested this, and it appears to be working ok. I don't understand what happened in your case to prevent this from happening.
