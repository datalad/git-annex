Sorry, I meant to get those logs earlier but I got distracted.

One confounding thing in the previous runs is that I may have had accidental instances of git-annex assistant running on at least one of the machines. I killed them all for this next attempt, and named the dir annex2 just in case.

daemon.log files are now at http://bigasterisk.com/post/git-annex/logs1/
