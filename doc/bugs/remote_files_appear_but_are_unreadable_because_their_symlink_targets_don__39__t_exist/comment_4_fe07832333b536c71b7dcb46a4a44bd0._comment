I saw the 'syncing enabled'/'syncing disabled' switch in the webapp, which I think is what you're calling pause. That was always enabled.

I never adjusted the groups, but I see in the webapp that my remote is busted in other ways. It has no title, and settings->edit makes an error page. The edit link is like this:

http://127.0.0.1:38187/config/repository/edit/NoUUID?auth=4294a...333c

and the error is 

    Internal Server Error
    Unknown UUID

I'll try re-configuring that remote. I wish the webapp could tell me more about what is broken with the remote repo and where I might go to repair it.
