So we have the same version of git-annex from the same build, and only you see the problem. Hmm..

You mentioned that you see the problem if you disable syncing at a particular time. Does it only crash at that time, or at any time?

If you create a brand new empty repository and run the webapp in it, can you reporoduce the problem there? Ie, \"mkdir test; cd test; git init; git annex init; git annex webapp\"
