### Please describe the problem.

Installing on Windows requires installing git followed by git-annex.
Installing the former works without admin rights, but the latter cannot be
installed afterwards.

### What steps will reproduce the problem?

1. Create a Windows account without admin rights
2. Install git
3. Install git-annex

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?

Latest release on MS Windows.

### Please provide any additional information below.


Installing git creates read-only directories that cannot be used by the
git-annex install afterwards. Without admin rights, the read-only flag of
the git dir cannot be altered.
