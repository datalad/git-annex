Does Android have a /bin/bash, which is in the shebang of that script? 
You might want to try running `termux-fix-shebang` on 
git-annex-remote-rclone, or otherwise modify it to use a shell that is
available.

You can modify git-annex.linux/runshell to change how it runs proot. The
call to proot is right down at the end of it.
