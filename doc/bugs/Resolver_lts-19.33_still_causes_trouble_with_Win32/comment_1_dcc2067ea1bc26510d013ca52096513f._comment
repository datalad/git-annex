Drat. The problem is haskeline-0.8.2 depending on a different Win32
version. I'll take your word for it that was the only dependency solution
though.

Win32-2.9.0.0 is quite old and I don't want to risk reverting to some bug
fixed in the meantime. And I'm doubtful about bumping Cabal and directory
to newer versions too.

So, I've reverted this attempt, and won't make another one until there's a
ghc release that has the filepath (>=1.4.100.0) that Wind32 needs.
Shouldn't be more than half a year or so..
