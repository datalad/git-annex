### Please describe the problem.

After adding a directory special remote to a git annex repository, the git annex push push-win-remote fails with the following error:

Not updating export to push-win-remote because adjusted/main(unlocked) does not exist. (As configured by remote.push-win-remote.annex-tracking-branch)

The problem does *not* occur on Linux or macOS.

### What steps will reproduce the problem?

[[!format sh """
mkdir push-win-repo
mkdir push-win-rmt
cd push-win-repo
git init --initial-branch main
git annex init push-win-repository
git annex config --set annex.largefiles include=*.xtx
echo "push test file" >> push-test.xtx
git annex add .
git commit -m "add push test file"
git annex initremote push-win-remote type=directory directory=../push-win-rmt autoenable=true encryption=none exporttree=yes importtree=yes
git config remote.push-win-remote.annex-tracking-branch adjusted/main(unlocked)
git annex group push-win-remote manual

git annex push push-win-remote

### Have you had any luck using git-annex before? (Sometimes we get tired of reading bug reports all day and a lil' positive end note does wonders)

Yes. I am developing the easy-git-annex api.
