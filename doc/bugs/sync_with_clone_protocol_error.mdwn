	Failed to get annex.uuid configuration of repository clam

	Instead, got: "(merging origin/git-annex origin/synced/git-annex into git-annex...)\n(recording state in git...)\nannex.uuid=$obscured\ncore.gcrypt-id=\n"

Seen after cloning the repository to clam, not running git-annex init
in it, adding clam as a remote, and git annex sync clam.
Apparently git-annex-shell outputs some merging messages in this 
case, which breaks the protocol. 

Next git-annex sync clam worked ok and got the UUID.

clam has git-annex 6.20170101 installed.
