	git-annex sync --content d

This will import foo from d, but then it unexports foo from d.

Not quite data loss, because it does honor numcopies and the local copy
remains. But bad. 

The problem seems to be that it assumes it's merged d/master into master, but
that does not happen since master is not the current branch. And so it then
updates d to look like master. --[[Joey]]
