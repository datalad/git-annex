Please strace `git-annex upgrade` and display the end part of the strace,
before it displays this error message:

	git-annex: .git/annex: createDirectory: does not exist (No such file or directory)

I have not been able to find a situation where it can fail like that.
If .git/annex somehow doesn't exist (which would be very strange to start
with), it will be created during the upgrade.

The closest I've gotten is making .git/annex a symlink to a directory that
doesn't exist, which causes the upgrade to fail like this:

	git-annex: .git/annex: createDirectory: already exists (File exists)

Now, if .git didn't exist, it would make sense that creating .git/annex
would fail like that. But of course, if .git doesn't exist, it's not a git
repository. Unless, I suppose, you have done something to make git use a
different directory than .git?

(I thought .git might be a gitlink file as used for a submodule, 
but testing `git-annex upgrade` in a submodule with a gitlink file,
it does convert it to a symlink and creating .git/annex succeeds.)
