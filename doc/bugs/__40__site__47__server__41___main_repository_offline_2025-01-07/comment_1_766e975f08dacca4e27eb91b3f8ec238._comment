This doesn't seem to be merely a problem with my home internet but I also get the same error
on a VPS hosted by Hetzner (Helsinki data center):

```
jkniiv@jibun-ubuntu-2gb-hel1-1:~$ git clone git://git-annex.branchable.com/ git-annex-clone-TEST
Cloning into 'git-annex-clone-TEST'...
fatal: Could not read from remote repository.

Please make sure you have the correct access rights
and the repository exists.
```

Yet:

```
jkniiv@jibun-ubuntu-2gb-hel1-1:~$ git clone git://git.joeyh.name/git-annex git-annex-clone-TEST
Cloning into 'git-annex-clone-TEST'...

```

So what is going on?
