### Have you had any luck using git-annex before? (Sometimes we get tired of reading bug reports all day and a lil' positive end note does wonders)

Oh yes! I love git-annex :) I've written the hubiC special remote for git-annex, the zsh completion, contributed to the crowdfunding campaigns, and I'm a supporter on Patreon :)
