Interestingly, `git rm` does have a way to make it accept quotepath
formatted filenames:

       --pathspec-from-file=<file>
           Pathspec is passed in <file> instead of commandline args. If <file>
           is exactly - then standard input is used. Pathspec elements are
           separated by LF or CR/LF. Pathspec elements can be quoted as
           explained for the configuration variable core.quotePath (see git-
           config(1)). See also --pathspec-file-nul and global
           --literal-pathspecs.

I don't think that's the first thing I would have reached for though.
It's not a common option supported by other git commands. I would have
probably instead used `git ls-files -c core.quotePath=false`, filtered
the output to only have one of the two related filenames, and passed it to
`git rm` as a parameter.

If git had a common way to accept quotepath input, I'd think that git-annex
should support it, but since it doesn't, I'm unsure that it's worth complicating
git-annex, since core.quotePath=false can already be used.
