Yes, it's also somewhat strange to me that I ended up with two variations of this filename (by UTF-8 encoding) on disk.

The filesystem is the default modern macOS one (APFS, case preserving but case insensitive).  From a quick experiement, it looks like the encoding of \"a with circle above\" is one of the \"case preserving but case insensitive\" things of the APFS file system.  Ie, I can create either variation, but which ever variation is created first is treated the same as the other variation when it comes to opening/updating the file.  Which I guess makes sense, as they're two different UTF-8 encodings of ultimately the same glyph.

FWIW, I also noticed while investigating this, this morning, that the encoding on disk in my annex had switched back to consistently encoding in both my linked copy (2023-11-03) and the annex archive directory (2023-11-04).  So with the two versions known to the annex, it feels like I might be seeing a \"first to be created\" race in the UTF-8 encoding used when sync runs.

Also FTR, in addition to the possibility that the podcast RSS changed encoding between the two runs, it's also possible that this got canonicalised by, eg, shell expansion, around 2023-11-03 / 2023-11-04; it definitely looks like I did a bunch of automated \"git mv ...\" to fix up filenames around that point.  (And then possibly the next git annex podcast fetch re-learnt the other name.)

Since I seem to have stablised on one encoding no disk right now, I'm going to try to make git-annex forget about the other encoding of the name, to tidy up this particular confusion for now.

But I agree it would be helpful to have a command variant that can accept the octal-encoded byte sequences (now) output by `git annex list`.  Both for cases like this, and in general for round tripping output back to input (something I do in some cases to handle scripted checks on annexed files against other things).

Thanks for the reply,

Ewen
