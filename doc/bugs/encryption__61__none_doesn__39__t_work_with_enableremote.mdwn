### Please describe the problem.
When cloning a remote client repo via ssh and then enableremote the encryptionsetting seem not be used


### What steps will reproduce the problem?
- create a repository (as client) on computer WO
- create a special remote via rsync+ssh on computer BA with encryption=none from WO
--> syncing works
- git clone via ssh from WO on computer XY, group is manual
- git-annex get on XY with source WO workes (OK)
- enableremote BA on computer XY
- shutdown computer WO
- try to get some file on computer XY. The download is first tried from WO, then from BA  --> correct


- download from BA fails (ERROR) 
--> Reason seems to be that encryption=none is not honored: 
rsync: change_dir "XXXXXXXX/GPGHMACSHA1--398057f8bd37edf898aeae4557c6277f1162382b" failed: No such file or directory (2)

I additionally could not find out where to manually change the encryption settings after enableremote
