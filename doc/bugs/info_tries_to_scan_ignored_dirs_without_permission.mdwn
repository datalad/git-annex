### Please describe the problem.

`git annex info` prints several warnings:

```
annexed files in working tree: warning: could not open directory '.Spotlight-V100/': Operation not permitted
warning: could not open directory '.Trashes/': Operation not permitted
warning: could not open directory '.fseventsd/': Permission denied
```

### What steps will reproduce the problem?

1. Create an APFS volume on MacOS
2. Initialize a git repo and annex in that volume dir (e.g. `/Volumes/my-annex`)
3. Add a `.gitignore` as seen below
4. `git annex info`

.gitignore:

```
.Spotlight-V100
.Trashes
.fseventsd
```
