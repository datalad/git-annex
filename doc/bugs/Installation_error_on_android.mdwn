### Please describe the problem.

Following the installation instructions for android (termux), I get an error while sourcing git-annex-install:

```
Running on Android.. Tuning for optimal behavior.
sed: can't read /data/data/com.termux/files/home/git-annex.linux/git-remote-annex: No such file or directory
```

I can confirm that git-remote-annex is indeed missing in that directory.

### What steps will reproduce the problem?

```
pkg install wget
wget https://git-annex.branchable.com/install/Android/git-annex-install
source git-annex-install
```

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?

None yet x) and on a freshly updated termux.

### Please provide any additional information below.

### Have you had any luck using git-annex before? (Sometimes we get tired of reading bug reports all day and a lil' positive end note does wonders)
