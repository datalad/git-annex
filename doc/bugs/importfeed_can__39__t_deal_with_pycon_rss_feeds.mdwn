### Please describe the problem.

[[git-annex-importfeed]] cannot reliably import feeds from <pyvideo.org/category/65/pycon-us-2015/rss>

### What steps will reproduce the problem?

    git annex importfeed pyvideo.org/category/65/pycon-us-2015/rss

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?

5.20141125

### Please provide any additional information below.

It seems related to the fact that the `enclosure` XML item links to the youtube page instead of the actual video, which sounds a little crazy... so maybe the feed is just wrong and this is invalid.

In [this pull request to the conference proceedings repo](https://github.com/RichiH/conference_proceedings/pull/42), i hacked around that problem with a [simple loop](https://github.com/anarcat/conference_proceedings/blob/pycon/PyCon/README.md):

    curl -s http://pyvideo.org/category/65/pycon-us-2015/rss | xmllint --xpath '//enclosure/@url' - | sed 's/url=/\n/g' | xargs git annex addurl --fast

xargs doesn't actually work so well because every once in a while, youtube will return a 403 and the whole pipeline crumbles to the ground. I found this to work better:

    curl -s http://pyvideo.org/category/65/pycon-us-2015/rss | xmllint --xpath '//enclosure/@url' - | sed 's/url="/\n/g;s/"//' | while read url ; do git annex addurl --fast $url ; done

but it's pretty ugly! --[[anarcat]]
