### Please describe the problem.
git-annex ignores changing of remote location in .git/config

### What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Change Hostname of previously working remote so that the existing remote will no longer work and produce "ssh: connect to host <DNS hostname> port 22: Network is unreachable" errors.
2. Stop all running git-annex processes.
3. Edit DNS name in corresponding remote .git/config.
4. Restart git-annex.
5. Turns out: git-annex still uses the old remote's DNS name.

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?
newest one available.
5.20151116-gbe86081 

### Please provide any additional information below.
See following entry in log, occurring plenty often:
[[!format sh """
ssh: connect to host some.unreachable.dns.net port 22: Network is unreachable
rsync: connection unexpec
  rsync failed -- run git annex again to resume file transfer
tedly closed (0 bytes received so far) [Receiver]

### Have you had any luck using git-annex before? (Sometimes we get tired of reading bug reports all day and a lil' positive end note does wonders)
Trust me I love git-annex. Had dreams of something like git-annex for almost 10 years. I instantly got stuck on git-annex when I have read the first few sentences about it. Since then, things in my life have changed in a quite serious manner.

THANKS for your help!
