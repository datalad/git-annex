What's happening is Utility.LockFile.PidLock.tryLock
calls trySideLock and in these failure cases,
that returns Nothing, because another thread also happens to
have taken the sidelock. 

Due to the concurrency, the pid lock file always already exists, so
linkToLock fails. When it is able to take the side lock, it treats this as
a stale pid lock file situation, and takes over the pid lock.

(This could also affect other locks than transfer locks, potentially.)

One way to solve it would be to use a LockPool instead to take the side
lock. Then multiple concurrent threads could all lock the side lock.

Or, it could special case when the pid in the pid lock file is the same as
the current pid, and handle it in the lock file take over code.

----

Now, annex.pidlock is supposed to be a big top-level lock, which is used
instead of the fine-grained locking. What if 2 threads are each wanting
to take a lock before operating on the same resource? If either of the
solutions above is implemented, then both threads will "succeed" at locking
even though it's a shared pidlock. Which could result in any undefined
behavior.

And, in all the cases where it does *not* fail to take the transfer lock,
but instead takes over the pid lock, we're perilously close to such a thing
happening! The only reason it's not a problem, in the case of transfers
is that OnlyActionOn is used and prevents two threads transferring the same
key. (Also used for dropping etc.)

But this makes me worry that using annex.pidlock with concurrency enabled
is flirting with disaster, and perhaps it should refuse to use concurrency
to avoid such potential problems. Unless there's a way to avoid them
entirely.

Hmm.. Normally all locking in git-annex uses LockPool, which
handles inter-process locking. If LockPool is used, one of those 2 threads
will win at the lock and the other one will wait for it. But,
Annex.LockPool.PosixOrPid.tryPidLock/pidLock do not use LockPool
for fine-grained locking when pid locking is enabled.

So, I think it's potentially buggy in the unsafe direction of letting
2 threads "lock" the same resource, as well as in the safe direction of
sometimes unncessarily failing. Both need to be fixed.

I am leaning toward a process only taking the pid lock once and holding it
until exit, with LockPool used to make that thread safe. And add fine grained
locking using LockPool when doing pid locking.
