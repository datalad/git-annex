This bug report is, to the best of my knowledge, totally wrong.

Yes, git-annex sync pushes the git-annex branch to all git remotes.
This is intentional, and not a problem. That is just a git branch.
It's helpful to push it to eg, github, if you want to be able to pull it
from there into another clone. Pushing the git-annex branch to github does
*not* make git-annex think that github is holding the contents of annexed
files.

In your "reproduction" section, I think you forgot to run `git annex sync`
in Zeta, so its working tree had not been updated with the files synced to
it from Alpha, which is why `git annex list` didn't show anything. Or
somethig like that. You did not provide quite enough information to guess
what you were doing.

I'm going to close this. If you think it is still a problem, please provide
either a detailed transcript demontrating the problem or enough information
to reporoduce the problem, starting with an empty directory and
constructing the necessary git repositories to demonstrate the problem.
