These links are what is put in place if the content of a file has not yet
reached the local repository. On a more featureful system than Android,
it's a broken symlink, which is nicer than a link target.

So, unless the content has reached the local repository, this is normal.

There's a feature request somewhere, which I am having trouble finding,
that only files whose content is present be shown. I'm inclined to merge
this bug with that.
