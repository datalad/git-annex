According to the git-fetch man page, the syntax to use
for this kind of url is:

	ssh://[user@]host.xz[:port]/~[user]/path/to/repo.git/

Your url is missing the leading slash before the `~`, and has
a : with no port specified.

	ssh://git@gitlab.com:~/gitlabname/reponame.git

It is in fact, not a legal url.

Now, git might accept it despite not documenting it as an accepted form,
but why wander into undefined territory when there are legal ways to write
this url that work fine?

Does GitLab promote using these malformed urls?
