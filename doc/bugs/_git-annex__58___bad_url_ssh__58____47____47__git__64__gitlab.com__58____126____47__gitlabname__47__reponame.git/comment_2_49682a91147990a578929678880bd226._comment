Thank you. I was wondering about the URL as flagged above. When I specify the URL as I did, the git commands work but when I change it to ssh://git@gitlab.com:/~/gitlabname/reponame.git, git command fails with 

    > git push encrypted master 
    gcrypt: Development version -- Repository format MAY CHANGE
    gcrypt: Repository not found: ssh://git@gitlab.com:/~/gitlabname/reponame.git
    gcrypt: Setting up new repository
    gcrypt: Remote ID is :id:xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

    GitLab: No such project       
    fatal: Could not read from remote repository.
    Please make sure you have the correct access rights
    and the repository exists.
    error: failed to push some refs to 'gcrypt::ssh://git@gitlab.com:/~/gitlabname/reponame.git'

So perhaps I need to investigate how to get gcrypt to work with remote git(lab) repositories. Thanks.
