### Please describe the problem.

After aws-0.23 was introduced into extra-deps of `stack.yaml`, a stack build fails
in the dependency resolution phase (a plan construction problem). Adding `aeson-2.1.1.0`
into extra-deps as advised leads to a dependency hell with conflicting versions of
attoparsec being required amongst other troubles.

### What steps will reproduce the problem?

`stack setup && stack build`. Observe the following output:

[[!format sh """
Error: While constructing the build plan, the following exceptions were encountered:

In the dependencies for aws-0.23:
    aeson-1.5.6.0 from stack configuration does not match >=2.0.0.0  (latest matching version
                  is 2.1.1.0)
needed due to git-annex-10.20221103 -> aws-0.23

Some different approaches to resolving this:

  * Set 'allow-newer: true'
    in C:\hs-stack\config.yaml to ignore all version constraints and build anyway.

  * Recommended action: try adding the following to your extra-deps
    in C:\Projektit\git-annex.branchable.com\git-annex--BUILD-221108-4f6c6114f\stack.yaml:

- aeson-2.1.1.0@sha256:103ceb1421cd0ffa810bfb1acb1261d60addbde1a041fb5cce0056ff7d7dcdc2,5980

Plan construction failed.
# End of transcript or log.

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?

I was trying to build master or [[!commit 4f6c6114fb487b5f84aa7e6922786b0e19806525]], but alas no luck.

Windows 10 version 22H2 (build 19045.2130), 64 bit.

Stack version 2.9.1, Git revision 409d56031b4240221d656db09b2ba476fe6bb5b1 x86_64 hpack-0.35.0 .

### Please provide any additional information below.

### Have you had any luck using git-annex before? (Sometimes we get tired of reading bug reports all day and a lil' positive end note does wonders)

Sure, I use it several times a week with my multigigabyte backups, where it gives structure to my image-based backup routines, so you could say I'm a believer. :)
