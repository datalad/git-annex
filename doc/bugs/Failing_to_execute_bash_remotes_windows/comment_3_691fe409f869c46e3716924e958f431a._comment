Looking into it a bit more, the problem seems to be that findShellCommand 
expects a path to a file to examine, but when it's used for an external
special remote, it's only given the name of the command.

So, I fixed it by searching for the command in the PATH.

I have still not tested if this works on Windows, but probably, I think.
As long as PATH is set on Windows at least.
