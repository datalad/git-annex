git-annex on Windows already checks if external special remotes start
with #! and tries to handle the shebang, since Windows does not do that
natively. That was added in version 6.20160907.
([[todo/refactor_shebang_handling_code_for_wider_use]])

`git-annex proxy` does not do that, and I feel it's out of scope for it to
do so. So the proxy stuff you tried is a red herring.

It might be useful to use --debug to see what command git-annex tries to
execute when running the external special remote program.
