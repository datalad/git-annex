`git-annex p2phttp`, when eg receiving files into the repository, leaves
git-annex location log changes in the journal and does not commit them to
the git-annex branch in a timely fashion.

Usually git-annex branch commits happen when a git-annex command finishes,
but p2phttp runs for a long time. So a commit won't happen until it's
restarted or some other git-annex command is run in the repo.

This causes problems. Ie, if one client copies a file to the repository,
but does not ever push its git-annex branch, other clients will never learn
that the repository has a copy of the file. --[[Joey]]
