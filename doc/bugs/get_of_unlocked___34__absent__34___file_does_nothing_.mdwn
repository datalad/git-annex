### Please describe the problem.

situation is tricky as I forced it via `git reset --hard HEAD^` after a commit which managed to commit a file directly into git instead of git-annex due to changes in `.gitattributes` , whenever originally it was under annex unlocked.

So now I am in situation where it is not obvious on how to "instantiate" that file in the tree since `annex get` does nothing although file is just a link:

```
❯ cat .strava-backup/config.toml
/annex/objects/MD5E-s1235--04d86de671070073b0bade06fd5085c1.toml
❯ git annex whereis .strava-backup/config.toml
whereis .strava-backup/config.toml (1 copy) 
  	abe1a028-2aec-4c31-b48d-0db92e338292 -- yoh@bilena:~/proj/strava-backup-mine [here]
ok
❯ git annex get .strava-backup/config.toml
❯ git annex get --force .strava-backup/config.toml
❯ git annex restage .strava-backup/config.toml
git-annex: This command takes no parameters.
❯ git annex restage
restage  ok
❯ cat .strava-backup/config.toml
/annex/objects/MD5E-s1235--04d86de671070073b0bade06fd5085c1.toml
```

I thought I could just "instantiate" its content from the key -- but now `git-annex` insists (well - via `git status`)  that it is modified, even after I do `restage` and commit.

only if I do `git reset --hard` it becomes unmodified . I had to do `annex fsck` which made it instantiated but modified, then "commit" which committed nothing but everything became kosher.

There should be a more seamless way to recover, or should I generally always use `annex fsck` after `git reset --hard` when working with unlocked files?


### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?


```
❯ git annex version | head -n 1
git-annex version: 10.20251114-geeb21b831e7c45078bd9447ec2b0532a691fe471
```
