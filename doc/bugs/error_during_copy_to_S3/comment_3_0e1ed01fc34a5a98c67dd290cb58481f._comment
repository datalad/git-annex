Is this remote configured with chunk? (`git-annex info
s3_dssi-bioinfo-shlyakhi_sccrispr-data`)

Either chunk or partsize should work. partsize is disabled by default
because there are a lot of S3 implementations besides AWS, that may not
support it.

Generally, it's probably better to use partsize rather than chunk if the S3
server supports it.
