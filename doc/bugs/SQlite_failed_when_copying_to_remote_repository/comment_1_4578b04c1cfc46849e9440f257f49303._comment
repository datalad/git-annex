Seems to me that you are not able to read the `repo/.git/annex/keysdb/db` file,
likely due to a permissions problem or because it is owned by another user.

I was able to reproduce this by making the repository itself owned by
me, but making that specific file in it owned by a different user and not
readable by me:

	sqlite query crashed: thread blocked indefinitely in an MVar operation
	  CallStack (from HasCallStack):
	    error, called at ./Database/Handle.hs:82:40 in main:Database.Handle
