Version 8.20210223 is quite old, it would be good to try with a newer
version and see if the error message is different.

You might also try strace and look to see what it says happens when it
tries to open "repo/.git/annex/keysdb/db".

I don't know if what you showed about file permissions means you can really
read it. There might be ACLs or other complications? The best way to show
you can read it is to actually try to read it, eg `cat db >/dev/null`
