I tried to reproduce this by eg, making a bare repo that contained
the only known copy of a file. No problem.

<pre>
joey@darkstar:~/tmp/2.git>git annex fsck
(merging synced/git-annex into git-annex...)
fsck
SHA256E-s30--20c71ffd77c7f25e52416eb6afd36bf8df9410a9942d8a42e7caf74f6cfa5fb8 (checksum...)
ok
</pre>

I then purposefully told git-annex the file was not located in the bare
repo, even though it was there, fscked again, and it had no trouble
fixing the location log to reflect reality:

<pre>
joey@darkstar:~/tmp/2.git>git annex fsck
fsck SHA256E-s30--20c71ffd77c7f25e52416eb6afd36bf8df9410a9942d8a42e7caf74f6cfa5fb8 (fixing location log) (checksum...)
ok
(recording state in git...)
</pre>

You will need to investigate further why git-annex is not seeing the file.
