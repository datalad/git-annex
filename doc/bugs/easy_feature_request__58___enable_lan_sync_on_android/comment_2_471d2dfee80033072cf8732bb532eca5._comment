I would like to help (though I have not enough time to fully make the feature for sure).

With regards to:

1) It seems that there is a library which implements an SSH server on Android. I see it [at this repo](https://github.com/barryk/android_external_dropbear) as well as at [this repo](https://github.com/berserker/android_dropbear), both of which are owned by the makers of popular sshd apps on the Google Play Store

2) Do you mean that that library needs to be ported to Android/Java? If so, I could take a crack at it!
