What is an extension and what is not is ambiguous
to a computer. Eg, the filename "mr.toadswildride"
does not have an extension.

So git-annex has a heuristic, that an extension has
a maximum length of 4. Which works for the vast
majority of extensions in use. You can override
that to some other value:

	git config annex.maxextensionlength 7
