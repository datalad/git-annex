There is now a later failure:

	cron-20220527/build-ubuntu.yaml-710-90215d4e-failed/2_test-annex (crippled-tmp, ubuntu-latest).txt:2022-05-27T03:27:10.4794513Z     export_import_subdir:                  FAIL (1.04s)
	cron-20220527/build-ubuntu.yaml-710-90215d4e-failed/test-annex (crippled-tmp, ubuntu-latest)/7_Run tests.txt:2022-05-27T03:27:10.4794510Z     export_import_subdir:                  FAIL (1.04s)

Which was git-annex version 10.20220525+git3-gf69c6a360. Unfortunately
that means that the fix for [[todo/test_suite_unsafe_use_of_setEnv]]
did not fix this.

Also, the failures go back to before test suite parellization.
