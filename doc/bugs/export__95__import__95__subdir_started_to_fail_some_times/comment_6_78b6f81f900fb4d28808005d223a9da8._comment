Occurs to me that it could be that a bug in processTranscript is preventing
the test framework from showing all the output of a git-annex command
when it has exited unsuccessfully.

In both this and the other seemingly similar bug, the transcript ends after
a line of output, with another expected line of output not showing up.

Since processTranscript uses hGetLineUntilExitOrEOF, a bug in that
could mean it stops reading buffered output between lines like that.

But, I have not been able to find such a bug in hGetLineUntilExitOrEOF
so far. By either trying a process that buffers multiline output before
exiting, or by inspection. And even if it were buggy, something would still
be making the `git-annex import` command fail unexpectedly.
