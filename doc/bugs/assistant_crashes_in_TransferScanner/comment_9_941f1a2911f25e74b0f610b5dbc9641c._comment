You say it prints no filenames, but earlier you said: "In between git annex
successfully uploads and drops a couple of files to/from the remotes."  
... Which sounds like it must be printing some filenames.

Even when I make the standalone tarball owned by root, and move all
system-wide locale files out of the way, I still can't reproduce this.
So I think it must have something to do with the filenames in your git
repository, or something else particular to your git repository.
