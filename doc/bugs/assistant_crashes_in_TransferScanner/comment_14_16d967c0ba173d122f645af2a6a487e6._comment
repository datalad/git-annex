Tracked it back to Git.CheckAttr.checkAttr crashing when it sends the
filename "foö" (note the non-ascii) to the handle.
Which is odd as that handle is in filesystem encoding mode.

But, I then unlocked an additional file in my repo and it stopped
crashing, and I have yet to reproduce it again. Urgh.

Also, found an unrelated filename encoding crash:

	LANG=C git annex smudge --clean xx.oök < xx.oök
	git-annex: recoverEncode: invalid argument (invalid character)
