I fixed it. It came to my mind that I'm using a rather antiquated PKGBUILD on my ArchLinux system to package the current git-annex tarball.

(Fortunately, git-annex moved to the community repository a few months ago. Unfortunately, it's not maintained so that I was still using and updating the old PKGBUILD from the Archlinux User Repository (AUR).)

Turned out this PKGBUILD removed some executables from the tarball. When I unpack the unmodified tarball, git annex works perfectly.
