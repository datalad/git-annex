What is the output when using `git annex sync --content` ?
I know, same basic error as the assistant, but it probably displays
some filenames which will hint at the particular filename it's crashing on.

Investigating, it looks like there may be a recently
introduced bug in the standalone tarball where it contains
`git-annex.linux/i18n/i18n`. If you move the contents of
`git-annex.linux/i18n/i18n` to `git-annex.linux/i18n`, you might find that
it causes the crash to go away. I'm committing a fix for that problem.

(I'd still like information about the filename that causes the crash
though, since that same crash could happen if the locale was misconfigured
or if you were using a non-utf8 locale.)
