Ok so you're using that monstrosity where Arch repackages the git-annex
standalone tarball into an Arch package? I never liked that because it's
prone to this kind of breakage. AIUI, `pacman -S git-annex` will install
a proper from-source build of git-annex and is the right thing to use.

Anyway, I'm still wanting to get to the bottom of the problem
since as I noted the same problem could occur if using a non-UTF8 locale.

Did you leave out the filenames from the `git annex sync` output,
or is it actually not printing any filenames there? It's very hard for me
to understand output where some lines have been left out. It's fine
if you replace all ASCII characters in your filenames with `X` in the paste
you share.
