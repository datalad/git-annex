Was able to reproduce this pattern of output w/o filenames 
by throwing an IOError from Command.Sync.syncFile,
in code that is outside of callCommandAction or includeCommandAction block.

Unfortunately that does not narrow it down 
enough to know there the problem lies.
I need a way to reproduce the bug to get any further.
