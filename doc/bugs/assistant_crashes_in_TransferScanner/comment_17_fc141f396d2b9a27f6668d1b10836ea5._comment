After the update to 20161231, I tried again. Unfortunately, I am still getting the same error.

However, I noticed that removing the file for which I get the \"is outside repository\" error actually fixes the problem. Once I dropped the file from the annex as well, I was able to re-add the file without triggering this error again.

Please consider this issues as fixed.
