Ok, the bug is due to 2 files that have the same content.

	sub-000101/ses-baseline/pet/sub-000101_ses-baseline_rec-MLEM_pet.json
	sub-000101/ses-displaced/pet/sub-000101_ses-displaced_rec-MLEM_pet.json

Both files get deleted. And the bug makes it only pick one of the two files
to delete, because it's using a map from key to file and the second file
overwrites the first in the map.

So this would also presumably affect annexed files when two have the same 
content and are being deleted.
