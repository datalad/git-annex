### Please describe the problem.

I have two machines connected with annex assistant via XMPP and S3. I placed a file into the annex directory on one computer, and it fairly immediately transferred to the other, as expected. However the resulting file appears to be truncated.

### What steps will reproduce the problem?

Unknown, I haven't noticed this happen before.

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?

The sending end was from commit ef1fd09c5c1c3950727f0760df36075e45192b33 (Tue Jul 2 16:52:43 2013 +0000), the receiving end was at 1c16de8ebcef6c1920a8437af380f8aea5a2c535 (Wed Jun 12 20:31:43 2013 +0000). Both on Ubuntu 13.04.

### Please provide any additional information below.

Details of the file at the sending end:

(it was coincidence I expect that it was a deb of git-annex I'd just made :)

Some more poking indicates that it's not strictly a truncation, not too far into the file, the content changes:

Oddly, there seems to be a pattern in the difference of the first incorrect row, it looks like kind of like strange endian weirdness rearranging things.

aabb ccdd eeff gghh

becomes:

bbdd ffcc hhee ..gg

where the .. comes from further along the pattern.

Deleting and re-adding the file doesn't cause the new version to appear, but that's presumably because it's addressing by SHA, so it doesn't see that as a change.
