Following the installation instructions for termux fails on multiple
phones (including my own) with "Bad system call" when it comes to running
git-annex.

My guess as to what has happened is that the arm64 build has been updated
to use a newer version of glibc etc, and that is trying to use a syscall
that the Android kernel is too old to support. (Kernel 4.19 in my phone's
case.)

Unsure when it broke, but the arm64 build is built on Debian testing
for whatever reason, so it's will need a reasonably recent kernel. Perhaps
there should be an equivilant of the i386-ancient build for older arm64
systems? arm64 has by now been around as long as the Debian jessie used for
i386-ancient. --[[Joey]]
