This is a rsync protocol level error; one side is sending something
that the other side fails to deal with. We can see in your log that the
two rsync are communicating successfully over the ssh connection
at first.

This could be something not clean about your ssh connection, or some incompatibility
in the versions of rsync or git-annex between the client and the server.
It probably wouldn't hurt to make sure client and server have the same rsync
version, and perhaps upgrade them both to the newest git-annex in case this
problem is somehow fixed there.

Then, seems to me that the next step is to get git-annex-shell out of the
picture and see if you can still reproduce the problem. You can find the rsync
command that git-annex-shell runs by passing --debug to it. The just replace
the git-annex-shell command in your python code with the rsync command it runs.

Here's a shell command line I came up with by doing that. It will have
different paths for your repo, and localhost will need to be changed to your
server's name.
