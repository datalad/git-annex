Git can follow the rename fine if the file is committed before `git annex fix` (you can git commit -n to see this), so 
making git-annex pre-commit generate a fixup commit before the staged commit would be one way. Or the other two ways I originally mentioned when writing down this minor issue. I like all those approaches better than .git-annex clutter.
