That seems an excellent idea, also eliminating the need for git annex fix after moving. 

However, I think CVS and svn have taught us the pain associated with a version control system putting something in every subdirectory. Would this pain be worth avoiding the minor pain of needing git annex fix and sometimes being unable to follow renames?
