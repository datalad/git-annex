FWIW, I don't see this problem in a v10 repo on ext4. I set annex.pidlock in
case it being set somehow causes a locking problem.

Try running this, in a repo where it hangs, to debug at what
point in the git-annex filter-process it is hanging.

	GIT_TRACE_PACKET=1 GIT_TRACE=1 git status

Then try disabling filter-process and confirm if it hangs or not:

	git config --unset filter.annex.process
	git status
