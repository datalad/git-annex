So I think I have this issue completely wrong, apologies.


The problem recurred again today, on a v8 repo, and with yesterday's release of git-annex. There is definitely a problem with locking, but it can't be due to the changes in version 10.

To debug further, I removed only some files at a time from the .git/annex directory. The offending files were the keysdb (I did `rm -rf keysdb*`, so I'm not sure which of the specific files were the offenders).

I'll keep you posted as I debug it further, but I thought I should let you know immediately that my original diagnosis was wrong.
