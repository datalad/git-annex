If filter-process is the problem, it does not make sense that repo v9
v9 would not have the problem, because v9 enables filter-process.
If v9 is ok and only v10 has the problem then it must have something to
do with the locking changes in v10.

Also, you can upgrade to v9/v10 and still disable git-annex filter-process,
by running this after the upgrade:

	git config --unset filter.annex.process

(Note that git-annex had a bug that caused v9 to upgrade to v10
without waiting the year it was supposed to. That bug is why your v9 repo
upgraded. That was fixed in today's git-annex release.)
