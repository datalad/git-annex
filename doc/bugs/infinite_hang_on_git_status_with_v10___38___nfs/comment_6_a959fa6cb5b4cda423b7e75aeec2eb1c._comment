Thanks for confirming my feeling that something about the bug as reported
was not quite right.

It it was keysdb.cache or keysdb.lck, then it might be a locking problem in
git-annex.

But it seems more likely it was `keysdb/*`.. And that is a sqlite database.
And if sqlite has problems with its internal locking that don't work on
your filesystem, it would be hard to fix that in git-annex. Not using
sqlite or switching the database from WAL mode to non-WAL mode are about
all git-annex could do and both would be major undertakings.

A recently added feature to git-annex is the annex.dbdir git config.
That can be set to a directory on another filesystem, and git-annex will
store all its sqlite databases in that directory. I think this option is
your best chance of avoiding the problem.
