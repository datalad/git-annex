I had the same problem, also with Android 4.1.1 (an Asus TF201). This is what I did:

- Download version for Android 4.3 and 4.4 (autobuilds) and install that one over the previous.
- Add the remote, which worked just fine.
- Reinstall the version for Android 4.1 (autobuilds)

And things seem to be working (things are syncing to the Android)
