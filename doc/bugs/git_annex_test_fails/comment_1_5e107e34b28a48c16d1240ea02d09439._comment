[Two separate problems reported in one bug report always makes extra work and
risks one of the probles being forgotten about.
Separate bug reports for separate problems, please.]

I can reproduce test not working outside of a git repository.
That is a reversion from 6.20170818. Bisected to commit
db2a06b66f0aaf5a8e8822a0c01aa614a8e7a5a9. Fixed.

The too many open files was also mentioned by another OSX user (also in a
bug report about something else; that bug was closed...). I have not quite
reproduced it, but running git-annex test on OSX I did see it was using 600
or more open files and had quite a few git processes stacked up. There may
be a small leak there, that's more likely to trip over a smaller limit on
OSX.
