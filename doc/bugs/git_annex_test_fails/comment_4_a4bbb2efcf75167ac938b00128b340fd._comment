Built with ghc 8.2.1 on linux, I am seeing significantly more sub-processes
and open files. Up to 170 sub-processes and 350 open files.

Most of the open files are pipes.
Most of the sub-processes are git cat-file --batch, and these are
definitely lingering from test repos it's no longer using.

Kind of looks like the annex state created by Test.annexeval
is not getting garbage collected, and so the handles it has open are
not getting closed. Hmm, I don't normally rely on GC to close handles,
and am a bit surprised that ever worked, since the handles are pipes to
processes that have no reason to exit unless the handles are closed.

Made it explicitly stop the co-processes, and that seems to have fixed it.
Indeed, the number of git subprocesses dropped to mostly below 10 since
they get cleaned up without waiting for GC now.
