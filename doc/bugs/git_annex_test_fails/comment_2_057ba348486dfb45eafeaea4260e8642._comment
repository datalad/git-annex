On linux I'm seeing only around 90 open files max (mostly pipes to git), 
and maybe 30 git processes max. It does not seem to be leaking a
git process per test directory or anything like that on linux.

On OSX, more accurate look at the open files (75868 is the pid of the
git-annex test process)

	while sleep 1; do lsof -p 75868|wc -l; done
	      24
	      32
	      36
	      46
	      47
	      49
	      41
	      32
	      24
	      30
	      27
	...

Never went above 80 open files. Similarly:

	while sleep 1; do ps | grep git |wc -l; done
	      20
	      17
	      18
	      17
	      15
	      22
	       9
	      14
	      11
	      19
	       9
	      11
	      17

	...

Never went over 30 processes.

It would be very helpful to pause git-annex test when it starts failing
and take a look at lsof and ps to see what open files and child processes
it has.
