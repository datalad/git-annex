### Please describe the problem.
See the logs. git-annex-shell tries to use not existing runshell


### What steps will reproduce the problem?
I am on Debian testing and have, some month ago, tried the tarball distribution.
I have returned to deb packages later and  deleted the tarball installation. 
Seems that there some traces left.  

I have tried to find the runshell configuration, but failed to do so.

I have destroyed the repo completely, has not helped.
