I've updated the cabal file, it should build now. Although unfortunately
the breaking changes to cabal are such that it might still fail to build
with some OS's and some combinations of build flags, where it used to build
before. I only tested on Linux with stack (modified for resolver:
nightly-2017-08-17)

As to the quickcheck failures, I think that's the same problem I already
fixed in [[!commit da8e84efe997fcbfcf489bc4fa9cc835ed131d3a]].
