Thanks for working on this!

It's entirely possible that the quickcheck tests happen to generate
better test data under the new ghc, and have found an actual bug.
I doubt that it's related to your changes.

I do need git-annex to remain buildable on OSX and Windows. What basically
needs to be done is, instead of sed-ing those files out of the cabal file,
make the cabal file say "if os(windows)" to conditionally include the
modules that only work on one OS.
