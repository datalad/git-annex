Hi Joey,

Yes, I can work around that particular failure by tweaking constraints.

In particular,
--allow-newer=\"sandi:base\" --allow-newer=\"aws:time\"

I also first need to \"cabal install Cabal<1.25\" because git-annex seems
to have a compatibility problem with Cabal-2.0.0.2. The error with
Cabal-2.0.0.2 is

[[!format sh \"\"\"
Building executable 'git-annex' for git-annex-6.20170520..

Build/BuildVersion.hs:1:1: error:
    File name does not match module name:
    Saw: ‘Main’
    Expected: ‘Build.BuildVersion’

cabal: Error: some packages failed to install:
git-annex-6.20170520-3mbb3kAWTlXI0EMervIo66 failed during the building phase.
The exception was:
ExitFailure 1
\"\"\"]]

But, once I've installed the lower version of Cabal, and tweaked the 
constraints for sandi and for aws, git-annex does build successfully.

However, at that point a more serious issue comes up when I run \"git 
annex test\" and here is the full log:
