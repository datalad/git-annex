If I recall correctly, export initially only exported annexed files, but
that was very surprising behavior to some people who use a mixture of
files.

And this is documented behavior:

> Any files in the treeish that are stored on git will also be exported to
> the special remote.

The docs also say that the preferred content expression allows exluding
annexed files, not that it does anything for non-annexed files.

So I don't see how this is a bug. At most, it might be a feature request
to have a way to exclude non-annexed files from the export.

(I was curious if a preferred content of "not inbackend=GIT" happened to work,
since internally these files are treated as a "GIT" backend type. It happens
not to work as currently implemented. It could be made to work pretty easily,
but "GIT" is currently an undocumented implementation detail and I don't know
if I want to expose it as part of the interface.)

Also, consider that import works symmetrically to export, and so if such a
feature were implemented, it would make import skip files that annex.largefiles
does not match.
