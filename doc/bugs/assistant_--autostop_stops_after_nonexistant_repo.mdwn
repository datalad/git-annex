### Please describe the problem.

`git annex assistant --autostop` stops shutting down processes after encountering the first non-existant repo listed in `.config/git-annex/autostart`, leaving other processes running.

### What steps will reproduce the problem?

- add several existing repos to `.config/git-annex/autostart`
- somewhere in the middle, add a non-existant path
- run `git annex assistant --autostart` (this just skips the nonexistant repo interestingly)
- run `git annex assistant --autostop` (this fails on the nonexistant repo and doesn't continue with the others)

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?

```
# on Linux
‚ùØ git annex version                                                                                                             
git-annex version: 10.20230329-ge6a337e8e
```


### Have you had any luck using git-annex before? (Sometimes we get tired of reading bug reports all day and a lil' positive end note does wonders)

I love it! ü§©
