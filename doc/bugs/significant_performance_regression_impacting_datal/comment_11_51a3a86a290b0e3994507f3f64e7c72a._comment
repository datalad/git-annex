I can't think of anything OSX specific in the recent changes.

I have added debugging of when reconcileStaged wakes up and possibly
wastes some time, eg:

	joey@darkstar:~/tmp/big> git config annex.debug true
	joey@darkstar:~/tmp/big> git config annex.debugfilter Database.Keys
	joey@darkstar:~/tmp/big> git-annex init
	init  
	[2021-06-08 11:52:11.854202926] (Database.Keys) reconcileStaged start
	(scanning for annexed files...)
	[2021-06-08 11:52:44.092620256] (Database.Keys) reconcileStaged end
	ok

All the new work happens in between those two debugs, so you could check if
the time sink is there or elsewhere.

(Note that the last release takes 2 seconds longer for that init than
it does now..)
