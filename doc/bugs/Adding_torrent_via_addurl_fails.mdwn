[[!meta title="addurl failure with non-standard torrent file"]]

### Please describe the problem.
Adding a magnet link via addurl fails after downloading the torrent metatdata if the "announce" field of the torrent is empty

### What steps will reproduce the problem?
    git annex addurl "magnet:?xt=urn:btih:88066b90278f2de655ee2dd44e784c340b54e45c"


### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?
git-annex version: 6.20160126
archlinux

### Please provide any additional information below.
I have traced back the Problem to the parsing of the torrent metatdata.
Since you also seem to be the author of the haskel-torrent parser I felt it is apropriate to post here.

The above magnet link (an Archlinux Iso) results in a .torrent file that has no "announce" entry. Instead it only has the entry "announce-list" with multiple urls.
This causes the parser to fail.
I dont know if having only "announce-list" horribly violates some standard, however a second magnet link that i tried showed the same behaviour so this might not be an unusual case.

I was able to put in a workarround in btshowmetainfo.py to set "annonuce" to the first entry from "announce-list" if it wasn't defined.
My git-annex binary is compiled with the haskel parser enabled do this doesn't change annexs' behaviour.

It's not a big dealbreaker for me, just playing arround with the torrent feaure for now.

### Have you had any luck using git-annex before? (Sometimes we get tired of reading bug reports all day and a lil' positive end note does wonders)
