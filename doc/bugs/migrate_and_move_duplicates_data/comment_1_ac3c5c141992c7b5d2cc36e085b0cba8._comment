I don't feel that migration is an important enough feature to complicate
the rest of git-annex with special handling of multiple keys that point to
the same content.

You could have used `mv` in your use case to move the repo to the new drive
while preseving hard links.

What might be useful is for `git annex migrate` to write a list of the old keys
someplace. These could then be dropped when the user wants to get rid of them,
with mixing them up with other unused files. Although if you care about old
versions of files and don't want to drop them as unused, it seems to me you'd
also want to be able to access the old keys from before the migration.
