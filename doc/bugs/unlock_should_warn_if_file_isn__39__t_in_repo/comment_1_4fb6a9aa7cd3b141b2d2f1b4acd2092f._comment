In general, git-annex silently skips files that are not known to git,
or are not annexed files. That's what's happening here.

This skipping behavior can sometimes be confusing, if you are not
familiar with it. But it's also very convenient. For example `git annex
unlock *` will unlock only annexed files and not complain about any other
files; `git annex unlock .` will recursively unlock only annexed files and not
complain about non-annexed files or files that are already unlocked.

In your example, git-annex has no way to tell that the file has been
renamed; a file that has never been added to git would look the same
to it as that renamed file.
