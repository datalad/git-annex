Perhaps other people knew this already, but I thought I would post it here in case someone else has trouble finding a solution to this issue.

I use a global gitignore that ignores most of the files I want to have in my annex.
The solution was to override my global .gitignore according to this answer at SO <http://stackoverflow.com/questions/26678955/un-ignore-all-files-in-global-gitignore> by creating a .gitignore in the annexed repo with the pattern
```
!*
```

Now it automatically adds everything (except dotfiles) when running `git annex add $DIRPATH`.
