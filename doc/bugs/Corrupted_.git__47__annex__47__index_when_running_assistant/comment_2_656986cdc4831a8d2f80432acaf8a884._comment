So, thanks for providing me the index file, but the relevant problem
seems to be that your index file refers to a git object that failed to make
it to disk.

The most likely cause of this would be a crash before disk buffers got
flushed, or something like that.

It's perfectly fine to remove your .git/annex/index if this happens. You
must have lost some information that was being committed to the git-annex
branch, so you might want to run `git annex fsck` to make sure everything 
gets updated.

I'd expect `git-annex repair` to detect this problem (and fix it the same
way you did).

It's possible that the assistant's code for detecting when there are
problems doesn't work well enough for it to have
automatically detected and fixed this problem. Which is why I'm leaving
this bug open for now.
