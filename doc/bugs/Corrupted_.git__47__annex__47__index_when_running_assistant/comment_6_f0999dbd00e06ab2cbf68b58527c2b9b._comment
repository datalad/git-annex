Yeah, --prune=now is bad news when using git-annex. At least, if
you might be doing it at the same time that git-annex is staging
objects in the index.

Using it in combination with annex.alwayscommit=false is a particularly
foot-shootish thing. I've added a warning to its documentation.

`git gc` uses a lock file, `.git/gc.pid`. It might be possible for
git-annex to hold that lock when it's in the process of staging and
committing objects, to avoid `git gc` running at such times.
