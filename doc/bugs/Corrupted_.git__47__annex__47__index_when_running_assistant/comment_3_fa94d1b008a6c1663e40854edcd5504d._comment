Thanks! FWIW I didn’t have any hard kernel lockups recently. I figure git replaces the index file atomically, and only after all objects have been written to the store? I guess a userland crash couldn’t be the cause either, in that case?

What happens when you manually run git gc at an inopportune moment, seeing that it probably doesn’t know about the secondary index? In the logs, I saw mention of locks on individual refs. Is the whole repository also locked down when git-annex commits something, or could it happen that a manual git gc prunes away objects added by git-annex before it had a chance to write the tree and commit it to a ref?
