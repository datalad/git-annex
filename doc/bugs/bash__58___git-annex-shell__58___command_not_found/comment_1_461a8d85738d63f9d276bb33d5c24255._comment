One of the remotes of your repository is on a host
where git-annex-shell is either not installed, or perhaps
it is installed but `ssh thehost git-annex-shell` does not
work -- eg due to the problem decribed in
[[tips/get_git-annex-shell_into_PATH]].

There was indeed a change in 6.20170519 that explains why this
only happens in -J mode. [[!commit 6992fe133b37ec6d64498f3dd2c69613c4c37469]]
made it run git-annex-shell at startup in that mode.

Hmm, I suppose one of your remotes could intentionally not have
git-annex-shell on it, and yet you'd still want `git annex sync`
to work to it, and so this message about git-annex-shell
being displayed is not ideal.

So, I've made it skip trying to run git-annex-shell in this case unless
the remote has an annex-uuid set. If the remote has never had
git-annex-shell installed, it can't have an annex-uuid set.

And, when it does fail to run git-annex-shell, I've made it say which 
remote it was unable to run it on.
