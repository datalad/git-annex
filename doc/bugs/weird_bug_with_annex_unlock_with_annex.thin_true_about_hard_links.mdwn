### Please describe the problem.

when unlocking multiple files, files are not hard linked, but they are if unlocked individually


### What steps will reproduce the problem?

I don't really know. 
Currently I have a repository that exhibits the problem:

    %git status --> all clean
    
    # this works as expected
    %git annex unlock bucket/tata
    %ls -li bucket/tata
    33292697 -rw-rw-r-- 2 karl qbstaff 102400000 Dec  7 19:02 bucket/tata
    %find . -inum 33292697
    ./bucket/tata
    ./.git/annex/objects/V0/3Z/SHA256E-s102400000--c50bbc52a81112507134d764ec570ab373be5c4a3b1dd1d87ce609d14d031a17/SHA256E-s102400000--c50bbc52a81112507134d764ec570ab373be5c4a3b1dd1d87ce609d14d031a17
    git annex lock bucket/tata



This does not:

    %git annex unlock bucket/
    %ls -li bucket/tata 
    33292708 -rw-rw-r-- 1 karl qbstaff 102400000 Dec  7 19:02 bucket/tata
    %find . -inum 33292708
    ./bucket/tata

As you can see, now the inode is wrong (different from the annex object file), and the unlocked file is not a hard link. The only difference is the argument to git annex unlock
This is really annoying, I switched to V6 for this particular feature, I have a large repository to update and it takes ages since files are copied instead of hard linked.

### Have you had any luck using git-annex before? (Sometimes we get tired of reading bug reports all day and a lil' positive end note does wonders)

Yes, we use it on a daily basis and love it.
Note that we will have to switch to LFS for a lot of use cases because gitlab no longer supports git annex from v9 release.
