The above would work fine for me but the files in my annex (e.g. .git/annex/objects/xx/yy/blah.ogg) don't have extensions like that, so my media player doesn't recognize them as media files. How do I get the files under \"objects\" to keep the extensions of the original files like in Joey's example?
