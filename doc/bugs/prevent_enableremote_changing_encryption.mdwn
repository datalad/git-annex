An exporttree=yes remote cannot be initremoted with encryption enabled.
However, it is possible to use enableremote after the fact to enable
encryption for such a remote:

	# git-annex initremote d type=directory exporttree=yes importtree=yes encryption=none directory=../d
	# git-annex enableremote d  directory=../d encryption=shared
	enableremote d (encryption setup) (encryption key stored in git repository) ok
	(recording state in git...)

This config change should not be allowed.

Indeed, changing encryption type of an existing special remote should never
be allowed, whether or not it uses exporttree. This is a reversion, 
probably introduced around
[[!commit 71f78fe45dc91dbef0bedd79b33d6a9fed85704d]]

Also, the new onlyencryptcreds=yes setting can passed to enableremote,
which changes a previously encrypted remote to not use encryption for the
data stored on it. That should also not be allowed. --[[Joey]]
