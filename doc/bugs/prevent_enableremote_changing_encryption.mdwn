An exporttree=yes remote cannot be initremoted with encryption enabled.
However, it is possible to use enableremote after the fact to enable
encryption for such a remote:

	# git-annex initremote d type=directory exporttree=yes importtree=yes encryption=none directory=../d
	# git-annex enableremote d  directory=../d encryption=shared
	enableremote d (encryption setup) (encryption key stored in git repository) ok
	(recording state in git...)

This config change should not be allowed. This is a reversion,
probably introduced around [[!commit 71f78fe45dc91dbef0bedd79b33d6a9fed85704d]]

Also, the new onlyencryptcreds=yes setting can passed to enableremote,
which changes a previously encrypted remote to not use encryption for the
data stored on it. That should also not be allowed. --[[Joey]]
