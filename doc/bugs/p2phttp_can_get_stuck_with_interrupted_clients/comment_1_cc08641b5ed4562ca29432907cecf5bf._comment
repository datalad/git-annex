This is extremely similar to the bug that 
[[!commit f2fed42a090e081bf880dcacc9a25bfa8a0f7d8f]] was supposed to fix.
But that had a small amount of gets hang, without any interruptions being
needed to cause it. So I think is different.

There was also the similar
[[!commit 1c67f2310a7ca3e4fce183794f0cff2f4f5d1efb]] where an interrupted
drop caused later hangs.
