So, can the slowloris attack prevention just be disabled in p2phttp,
without exposing it to problems due to that attack?

Well, the slowloris attack is a DDOS that tries to open as many http
connections to the server as possible, and keep them open with as little
bandwidth used as possible. It does so by sending partial request headers
slowly, so the server is stuck waiting to see the full request.

Given that the p2phttp server is serving large objects, and probably runs
with a moderately low -J value (probably < 100), just opening that many
connections to the server each requesting an object, and consuming a chunk
of the response once per 30 seconds would be enough to work around Warp's
protections against the slowloris attack. Which needs little enough
bandwidth to be a viable attack.

The client would need authentication to do that though. A slowloris attack
though just sends requests, it does not need to successfully authenticate.

So it would be better to disable the slowloris attack prevention only after
the request has been authenticated.

warp provides `pauseTimeout` that can do that, but I'm not sure how
to use it from inside a servant application.
