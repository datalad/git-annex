[[!commit 786360cdcf7f784847715ec79ef9837ada9fa649]] catches an exception
that the slowloris attack prevention causes. It does prevent the server
locking up... but only sometimes. So the test case 
gets further, but eventually still locks up.

Since slowloris attack prevention can cancel the thread at any point, it
seems likely that there is some other point there a resource is left
un-freed.
