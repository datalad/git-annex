### Please describe the problem.

I tried to add a bunch of files and one of the files contained a newline in its name.
When doing 'git annex add .' it failed with an error that contained only the part of the filename before the newline.

### What steps will reproduce the problem?

Create a file with a newline in its name:

    ~/tmp $ touch 'file with newline'$'\n''line 2'
    ~/tmp $ mkdir annex
    ~/tmp $ cd annex/
    ~/tmp/annex $ git init
    ~/tmp/annex $ git annex init
    init  ok
    (recording state in git...)
    ~/tmp/annex $ cp ../file* .
    ~/tmp/annex $ git annex add .
    add file with newline
    line 2 git-annex: unknown response from git cat-file ("HEAD:./file with newline missing",Ref "HEAD:./file with newline\nline 2")
    ~/tmp/annex $

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?

6.20161031 on Gentoo Linux

### Have you had any luck using git-annex before? (Sometimes we get tired of reading bug reports all day and a lil' positive end note does wonders)

I hope to have very soon ;-)
