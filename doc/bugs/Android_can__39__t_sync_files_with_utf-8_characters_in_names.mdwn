### Please describe the problem.
I have a repo where some files have utf-8 characters in their names. They are copied without problems between linux-running pcs, but on Android I only get a small, 206 bytes files with the hash data.

### What steps will reproduce the problem?
Add some files with utf-8 characters in names, try to sync to Android

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?
PC side: tried 5.20140412ubuntu1 from ubuntu repo and standalone tarball 5.20140517-gee56d21, both on Ubuntu Trusy
Android side: Android 4.4.2 on Nexus 7

### Please provide any additional information below.
Part of daemon.log I believe is related to this. Lines starting with Number followed by dot are the filenames, but truncated at first non-ascii character.
I suspect empty lines before the "rsync failed" represent files with names that start with non-ascii character.
