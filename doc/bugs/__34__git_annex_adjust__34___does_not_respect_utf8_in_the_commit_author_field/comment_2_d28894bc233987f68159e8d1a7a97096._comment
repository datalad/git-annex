Was a bit tricky to reproduce this (which does not excuse forgetting about
it for 5 years!)

	export LANG=en_US.utf8
	git init foo
	cd foo
	export GIT_AUTHOR_NAME=Félix
	git-annex init
	touch foo
	git-annex add
	git commit -m add
	unset GIT_AUTHOR_NAME
	export LANG=C
	git-annex adjust --unlock

Err... I thought I had reproduced this with something like the above, 
but now that is not working for me. I get:

	commit 50fedeefa3ece65ed4866fe7a1e0c1fe9cc90d78 (HEAD -> adjusted/master(unlocked))
	Author: Félix <joeyh@joeyh.name>
	Date:   Fri Sep 22 15:23:18 2023 -0400
	
	    git-annex adjusted branch

I've tried several other combinations of locale settings, LANG=C from the
beginning, etc, and all seem to work ok. I also looked at the values coming
into git-annex with LANG=C and going out, and it roundtrips unicode fine
even in non-unicode locales.
