### Please describe the problem.
My whole setup on all of my systems is with iso-8859-1. There is no use of UFT-8 (simply as my brain is not compatible to it).

I have metadata with `:` in it. That works perfect and ad it is a low char 0x3a, it should be displayed correctly. Unfortunately, when I create a view, that char gets displayed as `ï¹?`, which is fully unlogical.

### What steps will reproduce the problem?
* Create metadata with : in it
* create a view with that metadata

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?

### Have you had any luck using git-annex before? (Sometimes we get tired of reading bug reports all day and a lil' positive end note does wonders)
yes, that worked in the past (I think)
