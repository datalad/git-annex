AFAICS, the German message is the equivilant of `git status` when a file has been deleted:

<pre>
# On branch master
# Changes not staged for commit:
#   (use \"git add/rm <file>...\" to update what will be committed)
#   (use \"git checkout -- <file>...\" to discard changes in working directory)
#
#	deleted:    bigfile
#
no changes added to commit (use \"git add\" and/or \"git commit -a\")
</pre>

There's no indication here of when the file was deleted, or what deleted it. I need a way to reproduce this to be able to help. At this point it's not clear if the file is deleted by the old assistant that you ctrl-c'd, or if it was deleted while the assistant was not running, or if it somehow gets deleted when the new assistant is started up.
