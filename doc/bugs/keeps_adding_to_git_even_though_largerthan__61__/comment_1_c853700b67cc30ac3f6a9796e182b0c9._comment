I don't see how that could happen unless you still had an annex.largefiles
config somewhere. But --force-large would surely bypass
all configs and make it be added as a large file.

The places you could have annex.largefiles set that you didn't show are in
git config, and in git-annex config. My guess is it was in git config,
since that place to set it does override any gitattributes settings.
