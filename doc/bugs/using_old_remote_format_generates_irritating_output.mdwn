a special remote (encrypted rsync) that got copied to long ago (not sure when, there are old files that already have sizes in their unencrypted file names) seems to use the aa/bb/GPGHMACSHA1-- format instead of aaa/bbb/GPGHMACSHA1-. ``git annex fsck`` over such files produces very irritating output:

<code>

(observed with debian's git-annex 3.20121017).

while this does output an "ok" at th end and a zero exit status, having such messages in an fsck is highly irritating.

i see two ways to enhance the situation:

* silence the "not found" error when the file is found in another location
* a way to rename the files in the remote (i guess the aaa/bbb part can be derived from the file name; in that case, that could even be done w/o network interaction).
