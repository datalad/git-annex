### Please describe the problem.
Entering a jabber address which's server got a selfsigned certificate, the process just fails, without asking for acceptance for that certificate. This is quite a showstopper.
(for example: jabber.ccc.de)


### What steps will reproduce the problem?
Try with an account from e.g. jabber.ccc.de


### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?
Arch Linux, aur/git-annex-standalone 4.20130709-1 

### Please provide any additional information below.
There is no logoutput to add... I'm sorry.

[[!format sh """
# If you can, paste a complete transcript of the problem occurring here.
# If the problem is with the git-annex assistant, paste in .git/annex/daemon.log


# End of transcript or log.
