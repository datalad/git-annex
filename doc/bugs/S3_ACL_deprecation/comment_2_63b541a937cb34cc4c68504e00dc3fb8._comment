This only affects new S3 buckets. Existing S3 buckets that were
created before April 2023 and were set up to allow public access should
keep working, including ACL settings when storing new files in them.
Per [Amazon's announcement](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2022/12/amazon-s3-automatically-enable-block-public-access-disable-access-control-lists-buckets-april-2023/),
"There is no change for existing buckets."

I've made `publicurl` orthogonal to `public`.

As for the idea of `HTTP HEAD` before trying to set the ACL,
the ACL is currently sent at past of the PutObject request. And
either there is not a way to change the ACL later, or the aws haskell library
is missing support for the API to do that. 

While git-annex could HEAD without creds when publicyes=yes to verify that the
user has configured the bucket correctly, and at least warn about a
misconfiguration, that would add some overhead, and I guess if the user has not
configured the bucket correctly, they will notice in some other way eventually
and can fix its bucket policy after the fact. So I'm inclined not to do
that.

Instead I've simply depredated `public`, noting that it should not be set
on new buckets. The user will have to deal with setting up the Bucket
Policy themselves.
