With version 6.20170104 the following workaround seems to work:

  - Start the webapp

  - Click on the menu and select \"Switch Repository\" (as ususal)

  - Click on the link of the repo you wish to switch to (as usual); at this point, the WebApp freezes and the repo is not changed.

  - Keep cool :-) Select the Git Annex terminal session from the slide-down menu.

  - In the Git Annex terminal create a new window by clicking the (+) icon. This will open a new WebApp Dashboard with the newly selected repository.

  - Enjoy :-)
