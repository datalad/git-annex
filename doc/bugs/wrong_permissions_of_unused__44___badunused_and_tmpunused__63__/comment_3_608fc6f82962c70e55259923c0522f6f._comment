Joey, thanks for fixing the bug and for the larger commit (24df95f0f6ab474119aff3bbd942251373754ab2) to properly handle core.sharedRepository!

I see you couldn't reproduce the permissions error involving .git/annex/misctmp. Just to clarify: it occurs to me only with the user for which `git annex unused` fails, and not to the initial user that did `git rm`, for which `git annex unused` works. I can still reproduce the issue in this very moment with git-annex 6.20171211+gitgba511f4de-1~ndall+1. Nevertheless, I'll try the updated code as soon as possible.

And thanks to the anonymous bitcoin donor for supporting the fix of this bug!
