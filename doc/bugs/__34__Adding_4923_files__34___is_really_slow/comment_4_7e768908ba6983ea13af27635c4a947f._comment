Did some playing around, and I am seeing a progressive slowdown when adding lots of identical files in direct mode. 
This does not happen when the files have different content, and thinking about it, it's pretty clear what's going on: 

When there are a ton of files with the same content, the map file that has to list all the files using this content
get larger and larger. Each file added has to read and re-write the map file, which is obviously not going to scale well to thousands of duplicate files.
