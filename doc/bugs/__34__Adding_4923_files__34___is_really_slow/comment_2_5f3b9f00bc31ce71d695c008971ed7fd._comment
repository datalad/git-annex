I noticed that there were a lot of junk files with names of the form \"._*\" in the \"music\" directory I had added. These are created by older MacOS X systems storing Mac-related files on Unix file systems. (I think they're supposed to contain the old resource fork or something weird like that.)

So while the endless import was running, I decided to live dangerous and delete the offending files:

    find music/ -name ._\* -print0 | xargs -0 rm

A few seconds later, the 4,923 file import finished.

If I discover anything else interesting, I'll mention it. Once again, many thanks!
