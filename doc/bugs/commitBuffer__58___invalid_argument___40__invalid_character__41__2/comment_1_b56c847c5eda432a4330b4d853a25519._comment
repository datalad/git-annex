I cannot reproduce this, I get:

	addurl _dev_radio/DR14__Verschwörungstheorien.ogg ok

Does the _dev_radio/DR14__Verschwörungstheorien.ogg file get created?
If so, how does it look?

The jlog tells me it's trying to commit the git-annex branch journal.
Does .git/annex/journal/ contain any files? Any files containing German
characters?

Do you have any git config settings for git-annex beyone the typical
annex.uuid?

I noticed one place in the journal commit code where it does seem to
neglect to use filesystem encoding when dealing with writing filenames to
the jlog tmpfile. Which could lead to this crash theoretically. I've fixed
that, but since I couldn't reproduce the problem, I don't know if this will
fix your problem. Nor do I understand how annex journal log files could
have these characters in their names. You can try today's upcoming release
of git-annex to test the fix though.
