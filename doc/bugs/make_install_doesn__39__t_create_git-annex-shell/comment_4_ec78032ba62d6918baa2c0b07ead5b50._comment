Thanks! That leaves the issue that even when manually creating the symlink it still errors out (second half of the log in original report), but that probably is another issue. Should I open separate report for it? There was something similar in [[http://git-annex.branchable.com/bugs/Rsync_remote_created_via_webapp_remains_empty/]], but the command= part was in the file on my local computer only and removing it didn't make any difference.
