<https://github.com/datalad/datalad/pull/7372/commits/45ddd4b12ff637c6c77e982225c0e9d9eb53c1b6>
which was caused by [[!commit a0e6fa18eb3c16c3c8079bb41c18151e6ea8b554]],
which was part of my series for escaping control characters.

I think git-annex needs to be returned to the old behavior there, even
though `git-annex info dne` is not technically operating on a file when it
doesn't exist.

Update: Fixed this.
