This has been blocking git-annex release for the past month.

Apparently datalad has mostly been updated now. 
<https://github.com/datalad/datalad/pull/7372> is still not merged, but I'm
not clear if the 2 failed tests there are caused by this change or
something else.

I'm feeling now that I've waited long enough for datalad. I've closed this
bug and don't consider it as blocking release.
