You can edit the hooks that git-annex installs however you need to. It will
not overwrite modified hook files. If you edit this hook to have unix line
endings, does the hook still work when using this repository on windows?

Actually, I'm having difficulty seeing how the CR could have gotten into
that hook. `mkHookScript` uses `unlines` which behaves the same on Windows
as on Linux, so in either case lines should be separated only by `\n`.

This makes me wonder if something else modified the hook after git-annex
wrote it. If so, `git-annex init` should complain that the hook is
modified.
