Apologies, this is beryllium (by alias)... due to unforeseen circumstances, I have had to register with a different email address. I am hoping this is a temporary situation.

Further apologies... I acknowledge that I am vacillating  somewhat, but I've reverted to thinking that the hooks should be generated with unix line-endings (LF).

The reason I say this is, it does appear that the pseudo-standard for files under the .git directory is that they use unix line-endings only (perhaps an actual, documented standard... I'm not sure where to look/ask to confirm it).

This is the case for files such as .git/config, and .git/refs/** etc... under Git for Windows, and even JGit running with Windows native Java.

So to me.. it seems to make sense that hook files should have unix line-endings exclusively.

There are possible other mitigations... but that's where I stand with that finally. I'm still not fussed if no actions is determined to be the best course of action.

Thanks regardless.
