I should add, and this is not a commentary on the implementation of git-annex, etc... but having limited experience with BSD, and understanding that it uses different line endings for text files (???)... and other considerations... the git hooks mechanism is powerful, but seemingly presents challenges for interoperability.

Maybe the right approach is actually... as I did... let the end-user find their own workaround. It seems it's not really a git-annex fault after all.

I initially thought that git-annex should write the file out correctly... but it kind of is. It's writing it out for the local sensibilities.

In this particular case, it's my challenge to solve, not the tools... if you agree, I'd be content to have this closed with no action.

But I leave it to your better judgement.
