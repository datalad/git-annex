If I was on the wrong track with my first comment, it would be helpful
to take a look at the content identifier that is recorded for
the key, by running:

	git show git-annex:$(git-annex examinekey SHA256E-s55936559--0d418e4bb62cfc7ef5b053f8b622dd72794781a49931abc41bb9499acaf51b09.mp4 --format='${hashdirlower}${key}.log.cid')

The part after the UUID in the output is the content identifier(s). If more
than one, they are separated by colons. The format of a content identifier
is "inode size mtime", and the inode will be 0 if it was generated with
ignoreinodes=yes. So you could then compare the content identifiers
with the stat of the files in the directory special remote and see if
something has actually changed.
