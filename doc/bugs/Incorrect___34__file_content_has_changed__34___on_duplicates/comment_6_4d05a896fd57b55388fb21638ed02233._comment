Ah, here's the smoking gun: In Remote.Helper.ExportImport,
it gets the cids for a key. And promptly picks the first one to pass to
retrieveExportWithContentIdentifier, ignoring all the rest.
It also gets the first recorded export location and likewise passes it to
retrieveExportWithContentIdentifier.

It seems like a fix would be to try retrieveExportWithContentIdentifier
with each combination of cid and export location. But that would cause an
`O(N^2)` explosion and it's possible a remote has say 1000 empty files in
it.

Maybe instead make retrieveExportWithContentIdentifier take a list of valid
cids, and accept any one of them? Then it would only need to be tried on
each export location in turn until one succeeds. 

(Hm, removeExportWithContentIdentifier and 
checkPresentExportWithContentIdentifier already use a list, so similar problems
are avoided with them.)
