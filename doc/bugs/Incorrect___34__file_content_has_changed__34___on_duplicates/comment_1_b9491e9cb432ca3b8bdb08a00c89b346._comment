"file content has changed" is a message from the directory special remote
when it sees that a file in the directory has a different mtime,size,inode
tuple (content identifier) than the one that was recorded when importing
the tree.

Maybe that has something to do with the duplicate files, since they would
have different inodes. Except, it does try to support that; it can keep
track of multiple content identifiers for a key, and when there are
duplicate files, that works in my testing.

I notice that, if I have a directory special remote that was initially
set up with ignoreinodes=no, and I've imported a tree that way from it,
I can cause what looks like this problem:

	joey@darkstar:~/tmp/bench/x>git-annex enableremote t directory=../x ignoreinodes=yes
	enableremote t ok
	(recording state in git...)
	joey@darkstar:~/tmp/bench/x>git-annex get 3 --from t
	get 3 (from t...) 
	  file content has changed

Which seems like a bug that it allows changing it, but I think that the idea was
that, after changing ignoreinores, the user would re-run git-annex import,
which would re-import all the files since the content identifier has
changed. Still, I think that 
[[!commit 3e2f1f73cbc5fc10475745b3c3133267bd1850a7]] didn't consider that
it could cause a get to fail.

I know you have recently upgraded from a version that defaulted
to ignoring inodes. Maybe you only need to re-run `git-annex import` from the
directory remote to fix the problem?
