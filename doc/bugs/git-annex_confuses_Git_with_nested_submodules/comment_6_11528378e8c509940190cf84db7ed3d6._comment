I hope this will be fixed on the git side, but I don't know when it will
be. Probably comes down to someone developing a patch.

Occurs to me that git-annex could use adjusted branches to deal with this.
When initializing in a submodule, it could enter an adjusted branch with
`git annex adjust --fix`. This way, symlinks would be re-written to point
to the submodule's git repository. The .git dotfile would not need to be
converted to a symlink at all.
