Reproduced this.

This really does feel like a git bug. git is supposed to treat "gitlink"
files and .git symlinks the same. While modern versions of git set up
gitlink files for submodules, older versions of git used .git symlinks, and
git should still support that.

Looks like the problem can be worked around, by setting
`GIT_DIR`. In your example, `GIT_DIR=../.git/modules/sub_lvl1/ git
submodule add /src/somegitrepo sub_lvl2`
