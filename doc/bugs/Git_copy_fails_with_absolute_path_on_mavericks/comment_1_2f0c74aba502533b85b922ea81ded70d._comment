Using absolute paths to files is an unusual thing to do with git in my
experience. But, git does seem to support it, at least some of the time.

I think that git-annex's support for it comes down to what `git ls-files`
does. For example:

	joey@darkstar:~/tmp/me> git ls-files ~/tmp/me/foo
	foo

Since git-annex uses git ls-files, it sees a relative file and so
all or most all git-annex commands can work with the absolute file input.

Does git ls-files convert the absolute path to a relative path
when you run it on the Mavericks system?

What version of git is installed on the Mavericks system? Is
git-annex installed from the git-annex app, or from homebrew, or how?
