Well `fsck --from` does check the consistency of what's in the remote.
That entails verifying that the remote contains the data that
git-annex thinks it contains. But it also means verifying that the remote
does not contain any data that git-annex didn't know it contains. 

Checking the file is not present on the remote is part of the latter.

If you wanted to only verify that files git-annex thinks are on the remote
are present there, you could use eg `git-annex fsck --from theremote --in theremote`
