git (not git-annex) will throw this error if a file size is greater than
`size_t`.

This bug report seemed to originally concern git add being run on such a
file, but I can't see how git-annex would do that, it doesn't add large
files to git.

I think that in the case of git-annex status, when it runs git status, that
looks at work tree files, and so falls over if they're large, even if
what's checked into git is a nice small git-annex symlink. This would also
probably affect other places where git looks at worktree files, perhaps git
diff (in v6 repo mode).

Reopening bug report.
