I recently fixed a bug that would
likewise cause git-annex to fail on windows with a large file, although I
didn't see it failing with this message.

There's a good chance that git-annex version 5.20150205 might fix this
problem. 

I was able to successfully use git-annex with a 6 gb file, after the fixes.

Please check, and followup. I'm closing this bug provisionally in the
meantime.
