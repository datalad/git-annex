`sha256sum` isn't available on the tablet—at least not in the git-annex shell's PATH. 

I tried checking if it's present in the apk, and I don't see it in there—but I'm also not sure exactly where in the jar file I should find it. Unfortunately, I couldn't find an older Android git-annex build to check—seems the download site only keeps the most recent.
