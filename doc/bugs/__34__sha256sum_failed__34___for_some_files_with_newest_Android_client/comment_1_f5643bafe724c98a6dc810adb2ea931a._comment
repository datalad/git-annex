That warning message indicates that the `sha256sum` command is exiting nonzero.
git-annex handles that failure by using its internal SHA, which apparently
succeeds, because the `fsck` output ends with "ok". Indeed, I don't see any
indication that this is causing any problems, other than a warning
message.

The size variation is due to git-annex only using `sha256sum` for
larger files, where it can be faster than the internal SHA.

Android is supposed to have `sha256sum` and `sha1sum` available
(but not some of the other sizes). They are included in the git-annex
bundle, in eg /data/data/ga.androidterm/bin/ along with lots of other
busybox utilities.

So, the problem seems to be that either those commands are not in your
android device somehow, or indeed a reversion in the git-annex Android
build has lost them, or perhaps they're included but are always failing to
work.
