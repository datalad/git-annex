Seems to me this was probably fixed in [[!commit 6b37fcffd872b62fb78047a77e4cee5ab0bb57f1]].

However, I don't know why permission problems would happen on Android, which typically uses a filesystem that does not have restricted permissions for the sdcard.

If you upgrade, you should be able to see if it fixed the crash, and it will also mention any file or directory that it's unable to read in the log.
