### Please describe the problem.

May be I was simply wrong to assume that if I disable all sync'ing for all the repos, assistant wouldn't try to contact those remote hosts. But it still does

In the logs, since no time stamp per each line, hard to say either recent ones just continuation of previous entries, or new ones:

[[

that host (vagus) is RIP (need to remove from syncs)
btw which are falling into daemon.log.1 not .log

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?
