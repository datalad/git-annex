Works for me. Also if pull didn't work, sync wouldn't work and surely
someone would have reported such a problem?

But, you left out information including what kind of adjusted branch.
Please provide the details needed to reproduce your problem.

Here it is working:

	joey@darkstar:~/tmp/bench/y#master(unlocked)>git-annex pull --allow-unrelated-histories origin
	pull origin
