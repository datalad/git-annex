To close the loop (for anyone searching for this later), I had to setgid (`chown g+s <directory`) on the directories created by git annex so that `adb push` could successfully fchown them. It was able to write the contents of the file (the percentage went up and I could see the file being written from an `adb shell` but once adb tried to `fchown` it would fail and delete the file from the filesystem. Now my files are uploading successfully again.
