This is the `adb push` command itself failing. Since git-annex has to use
that command with an adb special remote, I don't see how this could be
fixed in git-annex.

It seems likely that the Android device is configured to allow adb to read
files in `Android/data/org.opencpn.opencpn` but not write to files there. 
You might be able to change the permissions with root access.
