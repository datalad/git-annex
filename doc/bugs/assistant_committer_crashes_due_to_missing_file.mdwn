### Please describe the problem.

The git annex assistant committer stops working and crashes under certain circumstances when dealing with small files.

This seems to occur when a small file is in the committer queue but is deleted before the queue is flushed.

### What steps will reproduce the problem?

Set the `annex.largefiles` option to exclude certain files from the annex: `git config annex.largefiles 'exclude=*.txt'`.

Create and immediately delete some file that is excluded from the annex:

[[!format sh """
touch somefile.txt && rm somefile.txt
"""]]

This will cause a "user error" to occur every time the committer thread tries to do a commit, essentially causing it to stop working.

In addition, if no file activity occurs for 5 minutes, creating another file will cause the committer to crash:

[[!format sh """
sleep 310
touch someotherfile.txt
"""]]

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?

Operating system: Arch Linux x86_64

git-annex version: 10.20230329
