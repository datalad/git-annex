It could simply commit after each change.
But that would bloat the git-annex branch with a lot of small commits when
a lot of files are being sent to the server in one batch.

I think what probably makes sense is to detect when the p2phttp
server has been idle for some amount of time, and commit then.
A few seconds idle should be enough to coalesce everything done by
a typical `git annex push` into a single git-annex branch commit.
