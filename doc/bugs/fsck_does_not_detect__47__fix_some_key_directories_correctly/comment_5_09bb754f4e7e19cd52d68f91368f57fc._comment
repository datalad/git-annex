I prefer machines to do the job instead of me, even though they need to sweat may be more than I for some of those ;)  not sure if needs to be an option or default behavior. But altogether, I am trying to get away from shared mode (ref: http://git-annex.branchable.com/bugs/--shared_setting_of_git_causes_annex__39__ed_files_to_be_writeable__33__/) with write permissions set on fiels since it is simply too dangerous if that repository is the single source of correct data/files.
