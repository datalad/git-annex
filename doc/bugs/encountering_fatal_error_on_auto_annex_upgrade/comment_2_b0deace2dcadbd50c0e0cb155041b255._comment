As to why the upgrade fails, it seems to me that mounting webdav as a
filesystem could easily have incompatabilities that cause strange behavior.

git can fail with this error message in at least 3 different ways. Although
in all cases it's supposed to be displaying a path where it has "(null)",
so it seems something is causing git to have a null pointer. That seems
like it almost has to be a bug in git.

It might help to run the git-annex command with --debug to determine what
git command is doing this.
