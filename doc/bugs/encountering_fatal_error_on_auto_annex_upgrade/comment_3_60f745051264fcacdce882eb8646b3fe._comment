Thanks joey. Based off of your comments, I believe I have found the root cause, which you are right, I don't think it's git-annex.

Also, I realise I should have added a bit more detail.

The /u01/webdav/www/ path is not a webdav mount, it's the backing real filesystem for actual webdav mounts. And this is important.

Further, this scenario worked with the Debian 11 version of git-annex, and I think those other bugs I linked to might account for the difference, because handing of dot files changed... but I'm not sure.

Also, I did run --debug, but the reason I reached out is, the git calls were of the form:

[[!format  sh \"\"\"
git --git-dir=. --literal-pathspecs -c annex.debug=true hash-object -w --no-filters --stdin-paths
\"\"\"]]

and I couldn't work out what paths were being passed via stdin. However, I've run strace and the reason I believe I see these messages is this:

[[!format sh \"\"\"
$ find . -name .DAV -print
./.DAV
./refs/heads/.DAV
./refs/heads/synced/.DAV
./info/.DAV
./annex/.DAV
./annex/journal/.DAV
./hooks/.DAV
./objects/71/.DAV
./objects/ba/.DAV
./objects/80/.DAV
./objects/15/.DAV
./objects/7a/.DAV
./objects/a8/.DAV
./objects/b0/.DAV
./objects/27/.DAV
./objects/pack/.DAV
./objects/a5/.DAV
./objects/33/.DAV
./objects/28/.DAV
./objects/b6/.DAV
./objects/77/.DAV
./objects/ad/.DAV
./objects/94/.DAV
\"\"\"]]

So for me, the solution is to use an actual webdav mount, even on the local hosting server, and that will hide these webdav \"internals\"/metadata.

Is there cause at all for config changes around git-annex to avoid that though?
