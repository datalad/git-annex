Root caused to this bug: <https://github.com/aristidb/aws/issues/296>

Seems likely that `git-annex import` from an importtree=yes S3
remote on GCP is also broken since it also uses getBucket.

git-annex uses getBucket to probe if the bucket already exists,
which lets it avoid dealing with the various ways that PUT of a bucket can
fail. GCP also has some incompatabilities in how it responds to that,
eg in the above log, it uses a custom "BucketNameUnavailable",
rather than the S3 standard " BucketAlreadyExists".
