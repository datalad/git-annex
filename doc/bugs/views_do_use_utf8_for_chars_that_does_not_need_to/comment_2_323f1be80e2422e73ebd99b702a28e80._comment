That is what locales are for.

Why not use them just correctly? It is just wrong to use utf8 characters in non-utf8 environments.

I think, the correct handling would be to stay with the user choice (locales and the raw text, a user used for the metadata) and mangle that chars just on such broken systems like windows.
