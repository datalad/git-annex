It's perfectly find to use unicode in filenames at any time. Files have the
name they have no matter how you configure your locale.

If git renamed unicode files when cloning a repository, just because the
current locale did not support unicode, it would be broken.

If git-annex metadata contains unicode and you enter a view, git-annex is
operating acceptably when it preserves that unicode in the viewed filename.

Maybe git-annex could try to transliterate unicode in viewed filenames 
in some way to work better non-unicode locales. But the locale can change.
And git-annex needs to be able to reverse view filenames back to the
filename used on the viewed branch. So it's not practical to vary the view
filenames to fit the locale, because that would prevent that reversing
from working unless it had a way to determine that locale that was in use
when the view was generated.

git-annex has to replace the `/` character with *something* when generating
a viewed file from metadata that contains that character. It used to
use `%`, since that at least contains a slash, but I didn't think that was
very readable. The unicode slash character it uses is very readable for the
vast percentage of users who are not stuck with 1980's era displays.

Sorry, it's simply a tradeoff between you and everyone else.
