The character is actually `ï¹•`

That is used in views because on windows colon is a special character
and putting it in the name of a viewed file would prevent checking out the
view.

It would be possible to skip that on linux, but note that it also 
escapes `/` on linux with a unicode equivilant (for similar reasons).

Also, the linux executable can sometimes be run on a windows system through
WSL. I'm not sure how a `:` in a filename would be handled in that situation.
