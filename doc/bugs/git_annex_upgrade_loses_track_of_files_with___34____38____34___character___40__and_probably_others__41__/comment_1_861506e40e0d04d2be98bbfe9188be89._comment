What an evil little bug. In retrospect, this probably bit my own test upgrades, but I ran `git annex fsck` everywhere and so avoided the location log breakage.

I've fixed the bug, which also involved files with other punctuation in their names [&:%] when using the WORM backend. 

The only way I have to recover repos that have already been upgraded is to run `git annex fsck --fast` in each clone of such a repo, which will let it rebuild the location log information. I think that is the best way to recover; ie I can't think of a way to recover that doesn't need to do everything fsck does anyway.
