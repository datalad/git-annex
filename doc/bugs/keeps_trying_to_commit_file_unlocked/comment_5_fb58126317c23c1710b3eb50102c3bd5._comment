So as far as I know this bug can only happen if something causes git to
lose the symlink bit. Which would be a git bug, or perhaps some misbehavior
on a fileystem like FAT?

Since git-annex's behavior is to stage a change that fixes the file to be a
proper annex pointer file, a user who encounters whatever this is only has
to make a commit to get out of the weird situation.

Unless we have a repeatable way for that to happen, that is not a git bug,
it's hard for me to justify making git-annex slow in order to deal with it
better.
