Somewhat unrelated and I feel like I might have even proposed smth like that -- wouldn't it be useful if git-annex did add its version and potentially filesystem detail (if cheaply known) within its commit message to `git-annex` branch?  unless `annex forgotten` later (and forgetting could summarize all the versions and filesystems used to that point), could have been useful here, or not?

FWIW, sent a few related questions on versions etc to the author of the commit which introduced that file.
