All I'm seeing here is a file that was locked and has gotten unlocked
somehow.

The new and old versions of the file in `git diff` are the same key, 
so this is not the same as the "inception" bug.

Was the assistant running in this repository? 

If you're using the assistant, it's certainly possible that something
that it observed happening on disk prompted it to restage the file.
And the assistant always stages files unlocked.
