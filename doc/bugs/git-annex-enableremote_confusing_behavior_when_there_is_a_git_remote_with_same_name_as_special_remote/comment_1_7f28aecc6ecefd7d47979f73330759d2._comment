The behavior in the first case has changed, it now displays:

	enableremote (normal) foo ok

And the normal git remote is left as-is. Which seems more or less
reasonable.

The behavior in the second case (passing the uuid) is still as described.

I've fixed that to instead fail with:

	git-annex: Not overwriting currently configured git remote named "foo"
