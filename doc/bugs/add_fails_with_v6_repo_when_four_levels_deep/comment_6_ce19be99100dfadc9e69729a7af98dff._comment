I also can't reproduce any problem running the script from comment #5
here. 

(The reason that `git ls-files --modified` is
throwing the error is because that ends up running git-annex
when in a v6 repo.

Seems like it must come down to the version of git, or some
other part of the environment, since it is only happening on one computer
and not others.

Are there any symlinks in the path to the repository where this happens?
Does this happen if you run the script in `/tmp/newrepo`?
