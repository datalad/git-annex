Just a quick follow-up; it seems that one of the recent updates (I believe the version published of 11-June-2017) modified the error messages shown. Running the same code above, I no longer receive a string of `fatal: '../1/2/3/4/foo' is outside repository` followed by `git-annex: git check-attr EOF: user error`. Instead, it shows `git-annex: 1/2/3/4/foo: getFileStatus: does not exist (No such file or directory)`, followed by the rest of the output I originally posted. That is, the output is now:

    git-annex: 1/2/3/4/foo: getFileStatus: does not exist (No such file or directory)
    git-annex: smudge: 1 failed
    error: external filter 'git-annex smudge --clean %f' failed 1
    error: external filter 'git-annex smudge --clean %f' failed
    add foo ok

I don't know what this represents, but I find it interesting that something was changed recently.
