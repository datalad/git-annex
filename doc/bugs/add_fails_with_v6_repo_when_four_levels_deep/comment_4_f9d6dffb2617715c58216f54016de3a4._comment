Hmm, I don't think an old version of git is the cause. I'm currently running the most recent build of git (2.11.0), but have used a number of versions over the past year.

I'm not sure if this is relevant, but this other bug reports similar behavior: [sync --content, fatal is outside repository errors](https://git-annex.branchable.com/forum/sync_--content__44___fatal_is_outside_repository_errors/). Specifically, it notes that there is an odd use of relative paths:
> The relative path ../Users is curious

My error also appends an extra period. In particular, the path should be \"./1/2/3/4/foo\" but prints \"../1/2/3/4/foo\".
