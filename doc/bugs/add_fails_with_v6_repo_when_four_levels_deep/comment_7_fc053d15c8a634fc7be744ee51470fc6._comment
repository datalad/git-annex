Thanks for the suggestions! Just to clarrify, I've tried this on three of my machines: machines 1 and 2 both run arch linux and both experience the same error (even in `/tmp/newrepo`); machine 3 runs opensuse but does not experience the error.

However, all three machines are using BTRFS for the underlying filesystem. I next tried running the script (on machine 1) in a partition that has Copy-on-Write turned off, and it completed successfully. So it seems that CoW has something to do with it (though the script runs fine even with CoW enabled on machine 3). So it seems we got a bit closer, but I'm still not sure what to make of it.
