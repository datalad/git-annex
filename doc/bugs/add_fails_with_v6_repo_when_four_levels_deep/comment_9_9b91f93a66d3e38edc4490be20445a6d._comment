Thanks for the response! I've [linked](https://github.com/tzmates/GitAnnexStrace) to a repo where I posted the strace results (only for the offending line, otherwise there were a lot of files) as well as the code that generated it. I'm not very familiar with strace results, so let me know if I should supply anything else.

It certainly could be a BTRFS bug, though it doesn't seem to be tied to a specific kernel version; I've been continually updating kernels for the last 2 years now.

If it's any help, I've never had this sort of problem using `cp --reflink` day-to-day. I have no experience with `mmap` though, so that's a distinct possibility.

Thanks for all your input on this so far!
