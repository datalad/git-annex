Please show me how to get more than one "import from foo"
commit that is empty, starting from a new remote.

I have only managed to get one, maximum, as I said.

I do not thik your CID analysis is correct. The CID is
calculated on the android side and has nothing to do with
the timestamps of anything in the git repo.

Now, if Android is varying the mtime it reports for files, so resulting in
a changed CID, it may be that would cause an import of content it had already 
imported before, and maybe that leads to the unnecessary commit.
