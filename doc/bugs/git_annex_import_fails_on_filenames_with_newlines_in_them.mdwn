### Please describe the problem.
I am importing a lot of old documents into my annex.  Some of these old files apparently have newlines in their filename.  A run of `git annex import` aborts when it encounters such a file; the file is moved to the annex, but it is left unstaged.

### What steps will reproduce the problem?
[[!format sh """
bram@durian% mkdir annex
bram@durian% cd annex
bram@durian% git init
Initialized empty Git repository in /home/bram/tmp/t/annex/.git/
bram@durian% git annex init
init  ok
(Recording state in git...)
bram@durian% echo foo > ../$'foo\nbar'
bram@durian% ls -lb ..

import foo
