The .git/annex/creds/uuid files for S3 special remotes are supposed to
contain the S3 access credentials, the same values you set
`AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` to. Since it's just some
high-entropy credentials, perhaps that's why you thought it looked garbled?

I doubt that the error message about the cause of the gpg error is
right; that is a workaround for an old bug in git-annex 5.20140916. Unless
you used such an old version to set up the special remote, it's probably
not related to that problem at all.

The actual problem seems to be:

	gpg: packet(2) with unknown version 13
	gpg: [don't know]: invalid packet (ctb=6b)

This probably points to an incompatability between the gpg versions.
The easiest fix is probably to upgrade Debian to gpg 2.

With embedcreds, the S3 creds are symmetrically encrypted/decrypted
using gpg --symmetric. This is a less common way to use gpg,
and it could be that there's an incompatability with how different
versions of gpg do it.
