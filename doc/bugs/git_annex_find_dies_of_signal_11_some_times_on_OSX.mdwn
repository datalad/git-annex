### Please describe the problem.

Very rarely we get a unittest to error out with smth like

```
2024-06-18T03:18:50.5586670Z E           datalad.runner.exception.CommandError: CommandError: 'git -c diff.ignoreSubmodules=none -c core.quotepath=false annex find --anything --include '*' --json --json-error-messages -c annex.dotfiles=true' failed with exitcode 139 under /private/var/folders/b3/2xm02wpd21qgrpkck5q1c6k40000gn/T/datalad_temp_test_path_diff49gfi408 [info keys: stdout_json] [err: 'error: git-annex died of signal 11']

```

unfortunately no more information is captured.  I just wanted to seek ideas on what could lead to exit with 11 and may be what data to collect.

original report: [datalad/issues/7490](https://github.com/datalad/datalad/issues/7490)

### What steps will reproduce the problem?

not sure yet how feasible would be to reproduce since happens really rarely

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?

OSX. Last time - from brew git-annex--10.20240531.arm64_sonoma.bottle.tar.gz
