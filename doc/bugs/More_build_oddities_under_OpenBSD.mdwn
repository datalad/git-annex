### Please describe the problem.
I have managed to get most things working under OpenBSD 5.4 now.

One of the last hurdles is that if I enable XMPP the build fails on "Loading package gnuidn-0.2.1..."
See the error below.

I suspect this is an error in git-annex because network-protocol-xmpp AND gnuidn compiles (and links) fine.

I will gladly do anything I can to get this working, but I'm at a loss what to do right now. It's the last major piece of the puzzle before I get it properly functioning under OpenBSD.

### What steps will reproduce the problem?
Building with XMPP support under OpenBSD 5.4

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?
5.20140129 under OpenBSD 5.4

### Please provide any additional information below.

Loading package gnuidn-0.2.1 ... 

GHCi runtime linker: fatal error: I found a duplicate definition for symbol
   c_isascii
whilst processing object file
   /usr/local/lib/libidn.a
This could be caused by:
   * Loading two different object files which export the same symbol
   * Specifying the same object file twice on the GHCi command line
   * An incorrect `package.conf' entry, causing some object to be
     loaded twice.
GHCi cannot safely continue in this situation.  Exiting now.  Sorry.
