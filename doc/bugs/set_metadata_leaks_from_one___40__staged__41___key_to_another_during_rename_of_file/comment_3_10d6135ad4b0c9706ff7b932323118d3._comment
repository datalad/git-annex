Hmm, if the file was not already in the index, that could be taken to
indicate it was deleted/moved and replaced, rather than being modified,
and so don't copy the metadata.

But that would make these two sequences have different behavior:

	git rm file; echo foo > file; git annex add file

	echo foo > file; git annex add file

As well as these two sequences:

	git mv file other; echo foo > file; git annex add file

	cp file other; echo foo > file; git annex add file other
