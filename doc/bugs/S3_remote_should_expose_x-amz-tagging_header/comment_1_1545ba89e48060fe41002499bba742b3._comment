Implementing this will need changes to the haskell aws library, since it
does not allow setting this header.

I opened an issue <https://github.com/aristidb/aws/issues/294>

Update: This will need git-annex to be built with aws-0.25. If a S3 special
remote is configured with this header, and an older version of git-annex
or a git-annex built with an older version of aws is used, it will just not
send along the header when storing an object.

So if your use case involves making newly uploaded objects private, you'll
want to make sure you're always using a build of git-annex that supports
it.
