ok, pulling the latest master and building on OSX now does this...

<pre>
ghc -O2 -Wall -ignore-package monads-fd --make git-annex
[ 1 of 63] Compiling Touch            ( Touch.hs, Touch.o )

Touch.hsc:24:0:
    The type signature for `touchBoth' lacks an accompanying binding

Touch.hsc:27:26: Not in scope: `touchBoth'
make: *** [git-annex] Error 1
</pre>

changing the #if 0 to 1 gives this...

<pre>
ghc -O2 -Wall -ignore-package monads-fd --make git-annex

Touch.hsc:95:43:
    Couldn't match expected type `CLong' against inferred type `CTime'
    In the second argument of `(\ hsc_ptr

        `(sec :: CLong)'
    In a stmt of a 'do' expression:
        (\ hsc_ptr -> pokeByteOff hsc_ptr 0) ptr (sec :: CLong)
    In the expression:
        do { (\ hsc_ptr -> pokeByteOff hsc_ptr 0) ptr (sec :: CLong);
             (\ hsc_ptr -> pokeByteOff hsc_ptr 4) ptr (0 :: CLong) }
make: *** [git-annex] Error 1
</pre>


it seems that commit 6634b6a6b84a924f6f6059b5bea61f449d056eee has broken support for OSX.
