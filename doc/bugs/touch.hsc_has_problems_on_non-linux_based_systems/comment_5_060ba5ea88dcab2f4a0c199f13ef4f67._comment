I'm leaving this bug open because this feature, however minor is not available on OSX and BSD. 

I have added a partial implementation using lutimes(3), which should be available on the BSDs. However, it's ifdefed out due to a casting problem: The TimeSpec uses a CTime, while lutimes uses a CLong. These data types may be internally the same on some or all platforms, so if you want this feature you can try changing the \"ifdef 0\" in Touch.hsc to 1 and try it, see if \"git annex add\" mirrors file modification time in created symlinks, and let me know.
