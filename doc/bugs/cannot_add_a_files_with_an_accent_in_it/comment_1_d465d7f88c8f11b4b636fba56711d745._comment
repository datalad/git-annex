I can't even type an e with an accent in it into the bash prompt on OSX.
However, I copied over such a file, and had no problem adding it:

	bash-3.2$ ls
	e??
	bash-3.2$ git annex add .
	add ë ok
	bash-3.2$ git annex status
	A ë

I also tried tab-completing a file named "testë" and that also works:

	oberon:gd joeyh$ git annex add teste\314\210 
	add testë ok
	(recording state in git...)

So, I can't reproduce your problem.
