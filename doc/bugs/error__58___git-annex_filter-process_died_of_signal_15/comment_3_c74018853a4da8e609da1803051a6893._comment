I also saw this when adding a single file to git:

	joey@darkstar:/tmp/a1>touch .foo.lck
	joey@darkstar:/tmp/a1>git add .foo.lck 
	error: external filter 'git-annex filter-process' failed
	error: git-annex filter-process died of signal 15

But, I have not succeeded to reproduce that again. This was in a v9 repository BTW.
