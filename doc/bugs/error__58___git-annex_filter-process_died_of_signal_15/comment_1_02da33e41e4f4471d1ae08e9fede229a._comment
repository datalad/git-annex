How big a commit are we talking here, in terms of number of files
added/changed?

I've tried with 10000 modified files and not seen a problem IIRC.

Also, signal 15 is SIGTERM, which would be a strange signal to happen
unless it were ctrl-c'd.

Final weird thing is "fatal: the remote end hung up unexpectedly", since
that would indicate a git fetch was running, and git-annex certianly does
not fetch..
