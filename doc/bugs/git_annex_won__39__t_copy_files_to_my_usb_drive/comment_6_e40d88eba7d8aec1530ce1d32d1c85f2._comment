The recent switch to using the Glob library seems to be responsible for this problem. It seems that
with Glob, \"\*\" matches \"foo\", but not \"directory/foo\", so the \"\*\" in preferred content for backup repositories matches only files in the top directory!

Writing test cases and fixing this now.
