It may be that .git/annex/index is referring to an object that is somehow
not present in the git object store. In this case, deleting the index file
may recover.

I can't see any way this can normally happen (short of the object file
getting deleted somehow); git should always write
objects to the object store before their sha1s are available to be put in
an index file. But, a couple of people have reported something like this
before.

Any clues to reproducing it would be useful.
