Try running `git fsck` and see if it complains about a corrupt object file.
You may then need to delete the object file and fix up the repository to
not refer to it. `git annex repair` can probably handle that.

Maybe, but you also say that the object it complains about has varied.
Perhaps you have multiple corrupt objects in the git repo..

You mention "litelog". What is that and how is it relevant? Is Android
involved somehow?
