This has occurred for me yet again, after starting a new remote.

Strangely 'git fsck' succeeds, showing only dangling objects, but 'git annex sync' fails on commit with this error.

litelog is a set of service scripts I'm making which automatically record and log from devices when they are connected.  Voice recorder and sensor logs are copied off of android phones from a handful of supported apps.
