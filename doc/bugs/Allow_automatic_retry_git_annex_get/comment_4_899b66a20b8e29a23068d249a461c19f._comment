Could the original bug reporter please show what your ~/.ssh/config
contains? As far as I can tell, ssh's TCPKeepAlive option, which is
supposed to be enabled by default, unless you have disabled it, should
avoid such problems.

It may also help to set ServerAliveInterval.

Unfortunately, my attempt to make git-annex set ServerAliveInterval
when running ssh broke too many systems with old sshed, and I have had to
revert it.
