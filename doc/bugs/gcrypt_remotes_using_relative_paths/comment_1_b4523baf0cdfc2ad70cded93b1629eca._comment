The lack of a transcript made this bug hard to understand. After about
half an hour of staring at it, I realized that you mean that `git-annex sync`
does not even attempt to sync with the remote when it has the relative url:

	joey@darkstar:~/tmp/bb>git remote add test gcrypt::rsync://user@user.rsync.net:relative/path/to/repo
	joey@darkstar:~/tmp/bb>git-annex sync
	commit
	On branch master
	nothing to commit, working tree clean
	ok

It does sync with it when asked to sync with explicitly that remote:

	joey@darkstar:~/tmp/bb>git-annex sync test
	commit 
	On branch master
	nothing to commit, working tree clean
	ok
	pull test 
	gcrypt: Repository not found: rsync://user@user.rsync.net:relative/path/to/repo
	ok

With the absolute url, it does sync with it when no remote
is explicitly specified.
