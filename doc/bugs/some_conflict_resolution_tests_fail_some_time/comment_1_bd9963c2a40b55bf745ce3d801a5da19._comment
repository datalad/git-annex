So `git-annex sync` is failing and somehow the failure is silent and all it
prints is "commit". Not "commit ok" or "commit failed" or an error.

This reminds me of another bug you filed,
<https://git-annex.branchable.com/bugs/export__95__import__95__subdir_started_to_fail_some_times/>
In both cases a git-annex command seems to crash in the middle.

The other one is also intermittent. Are both running on the same machine?
