If your remote contains 4096*1380 "GPGHMACSHA1" directories
with files in them then there are apparently 5652480 annexed objects
stored in this remote... not 780.

Unless the files in those directories are not the encrypted content
of annexed objects, but I don't know what else they could be.

You'll need to follow up with more information about what these files are,
or a way to reproduce this.
