Well these look like the names I'd expect to see used for encrypted files.

If you had the assistant watching some files that were frequently changing,
then it could lead to something like this, since many commits would be made
of many versions of a file, and each version backed up to a new encrypted
file in the special remote. You can take a look at `git log -S` in the git
repository and see if there are many commits of some of your files.
