### Please describe the problem.



### What steps will reproduce the problem?


I am  plowing through on making git-annex available within conda-forge "natively" for Windows.  For now I just took the recently built installer, the one now available from [datasets.datalad.org](http://datasets.datalad.org/datalad/packages/windows/) and built on datalad-extensions github setup.  I just extracted git-annex component from the installer and placed them within conda hierarchy (installed `posix` package with all the needed basic tools.  Overall -- looks great, but:

[[!format sh """
    prop_view_roundtrips:                                 FAIL (0.30s)
      *** Failed! Falsified (after 524 tests and 1 shrink):

"""]]

unfortunately I cannot tell from that output what could be the problem.  Please let me know if hard to figure it out and I should provide access to such environment (ATM needs effort, so I do not want to spend time on that unless "no other way")

And it seems it might be a flaky test -- I started another run, it is still running but I this test did not fail 

```
$ grep prop_view_roundtrips git-annex-test-miniconda*.log
git-annex-test-miniconda-2.log:    prop_view_roundtrips:                                 OK (2.51s)
git-annex-test-miniconda.log:    prop_view_roundtrips:                                 FAIL (0.30s)
```
