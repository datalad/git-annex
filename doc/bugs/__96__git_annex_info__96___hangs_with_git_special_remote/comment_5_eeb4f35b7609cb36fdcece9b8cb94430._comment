git-annex does only do uuid discovery of new remotes when it is dealing
with remotes. Many git-annex commands do deal with remotes, and that
includes `git-annex info`, which after all shows a list of repositories.
Commands that do not deal with remotes do skip the uuid discovery.

Since this kind of configuration can cause many different git-annex (and
also git) commands to hang for a while, it doesn't seem very useful to
do something specifically to `git-annex info` to deal with it.
