How about having `git annex info --fast` skip this lookup step for remotes where it doesn't know the UUID of yet?

`git annex info` can already be quite slow in the other steps it takes (counting files, disk space, etc.) in large repos, so it is not so much of a surprise that it hangs a while by default. But if `--fast` would make it actually fast by staying completely offline (right?) and skipping the slow local counting steps, this would be logical.
