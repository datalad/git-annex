An easier way to see this behavior is:

	git remote add foo 192.168.1.101:/dne
	time git fetch foo
	2:14.36elapsed

So I'm having difficulty seeing this as a bug in git-annex
particularly.

Yes, git-annex has to ssh once to new git remotes, 
in order to determine their git-annex uuid. git-annex
info needs to know what uuids each remote has, so it's
certianly right that it does this.

Yes, if that fails git-annex falls back to a git fetch,
in order to determine if the remote is unavailable,
or if the remote is available but does not
have git-annex-shell installed. So it takes twice
as long to time out as the usual ssh tcp timeout.
