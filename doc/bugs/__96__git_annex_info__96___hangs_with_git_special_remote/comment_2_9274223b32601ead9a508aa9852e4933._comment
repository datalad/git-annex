I've had an idea on this: Why not only update UUIDs on (manual) sync/fetch?

This would be in line with how git interacts with regular remotes otherwise too; always requiring an explicit fetch to update its info.

To me it just violates the principle of least surprise to have git-annex try and reach remotes when running something as simple as `info`.
