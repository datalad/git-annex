Thanks for your fast reply, Joey. I appended the shortened config below. Wanted and groupwanted were untouched and therefore still commented out. I removed the hash from wanted to explicitly set it standard. Now the assistant behaves as expected. However I’m wondering:

* Shouldn’t ‘standard’ be the default rule to apply for wanted/groupwanted in case both are not explicitly set in the config? I assumed this to be the case.
* Shouldn’t “find --want-get” list the identical set of files that is also requested by the assistant? Especially this one confused me.
