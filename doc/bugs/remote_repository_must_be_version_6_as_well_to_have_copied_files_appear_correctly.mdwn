### Please describe the problem.

Originally spotted/reported: https://github.com/datalad/datalad/issues/1020

If that is mandatory, then I guess there should be some error message.

### What steps will reproduce the problem?

create a remote repo without specifying version, i.e. of version 5 and copy data into it

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?

6.20160923+gitgd1dabb3-1~ndall+1

### Please provide any additional information below.

Output from running http://www.onerussian.com/tmp/v6-push.sh  with argument which specifies annex version within remote
