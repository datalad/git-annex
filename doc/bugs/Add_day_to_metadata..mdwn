### Please describe the problem.

The metadata doesn't include the day for RSS feeds, which is probably only a problem for me as I've built something on top of the metadata to provide an interface for selecting podcasts.

### Please provide any additional information below.

The attached patch adds the day field to the metadata.

There's also a tiny bit extra for stack.yaml which will only affect people who have nix enabled in Stack and will make the build successful for those people.

### Have you had any luck using git-annex before? (Sometimes we get tired of reading bug reports all day and a lil' positive end note does wonders)

git-annex is awesome, I lean on it heavily nearly every single day.
