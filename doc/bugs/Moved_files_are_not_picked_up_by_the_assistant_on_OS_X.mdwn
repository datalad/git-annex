### Please describe the problem.

On indirect repos on OS X, when a symlink is moved asisstant does not pick it up it. Even though assistant syncs after delete/move changes are not committed. git annex status returns ?? for the moved files. when I run git annex add on the files it says it added them but instead they still show up as ??. the only way to solve the problem is to manually restart the daemon which commits them.

### What steps will reproduce the problem?

Moving an annex file.


### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?
