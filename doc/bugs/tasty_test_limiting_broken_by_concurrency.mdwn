The changes to make `git-annex test` concurrent have
broken using eg `git-annex test -p 'concurrent get of dup key regression'`

It looks like the repo setup test is not being run, even though it's
supposed to be a dependency of the test it was limited to.

> Oh, that seems to be a limitation of tasty. From its docs:
	
	If Test B depends on Test A, remember that either of them may be 
	filtered out using the --pattern option. Collecting the dependency
	info happens after filtering. Therefore, if Test A is filtered out,
	Test B will run unconditionally, and if Test B is filtered out,
	it simply won't run.
