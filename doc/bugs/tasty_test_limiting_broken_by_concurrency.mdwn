The changes to make `git-annex test` concurrent have
broken using eg `git-annex test -p 'concurrent get of dup key regression'`

The problem is that tasty is being run with a subset of tests in each
runner, so most of them don't know about the test they're being limited to
perform.

There either needs to be a way to disable concurrency (eg, run all tests
in one runner with -J1), or the code detect when tasty is limited, and
automatically disable concurrency.

Also, it looks like the repo setup test is not being run, even though it's
supposed to be a dependency of the test it was limited to.
