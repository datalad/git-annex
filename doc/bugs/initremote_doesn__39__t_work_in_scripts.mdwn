### Please describe the problem.


### What steps will reproduce the problem?

Run "git-annex initremote" from an environment (cron, CI, etc.) where /dev/tty doesn't exist.

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?

git-annex version: 6.20160613-g35dbe35 on debian jessie

### Please provide any additional information below.

Error:
gpg: cannot open tty `/dev/tty': No such device or address

failed

Rumour on the internets is that the "--no-tty" parameter to GPG may fix the problem.

### Have you had any luck using git-annex before? (Sometimes we get tired of reading bug reports all day and a lil' positive end note does wonders)

Yes! It's great!
