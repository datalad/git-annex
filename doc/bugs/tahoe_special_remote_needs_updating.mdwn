After `apt-get install tahoe-lafs` installed version 1.20.0-6, this fails

    TAHOE_FURL=foo git-annex initremote t type=tahoe embedcreds=yes

    /usr/bin/tahoe:  Unknown command: start

The tahoe man page says:

	CONTROLLING NODES
	       In  the  past,  the 'tahoe' command offered service watching (with start, restart, stop commands), but this was not very portable
	       and has been deprecated.
	
	   COMMANDS
	       run    Run a node without daemonizing.  This is the only command for running nodes.
