What steps will reproduce the problem?

Add two remote repositories to same server using ssh. Each directory is added to repositories list and starts syncing. 
After both repositories are scanned click on "syncing enabled" to disable syncing for one of the two remote repositories.

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?

Only remote repository which i clicked should stop syncing, but both remote repos start to stop syncing.
Its also working the other way around (enable -> pause -> enable -> ..)

What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?

Version: 4.20130314, Debian
