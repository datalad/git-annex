Closely related, when a local repo is owned by someone else, cloning it and
using it as a git-annex remote also fails, at the same config listing
stage.

I think the same reasoning applies to that, the path to the repo is
explicitly specified in the remote url, so it should treat it as a safe
repo for the purposes of listing its config.
