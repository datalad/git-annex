The webdav server seems to have rejected the MKCOL command,
which makes a collection (subdirectory) on the server.

Is radicale intended to be a general-purpose webdav server?
The description of the debian package says it's a CalDAV and CardDAV
server. Perhaps it simply doesn't support generic top-level collections.
