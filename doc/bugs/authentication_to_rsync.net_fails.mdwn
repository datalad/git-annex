### Please describe the problem.

Used assistant to "Add a cloud repository".  Supplied hostname, username in webapp. Directory "annex" port 22.
Clicked on "Use this rsync.net repository" and got

**********************
ssh_askpass: exec(/usr/bin/ssh-askpass): No such file or directory
ssh_askpass: exec(/usr/bin/ssh-askpass): No such file or directory
ssh_askpass: exec(/usr/bin/ssh-askpass): No such file or directory
Received disconnect from 69.43.165.7: 2: Too many authentication failures for 2440
**********************

### What steps will reproduce the problem?
See above?  A simple "ssh user@host.rsync.net ls /usr/bin" reveals that indeed no ssh-askpass is available in that namespace.

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?
git-annex version: 4.20130521 on debian linux 7.1.

### Please provide any additional information below.

[[!format sh """
# If you can, paste a complete transcript of the problem occurring here.
# If the problem is with the git-annex assistant, paste in .git/annex/daemon.log

That log is empty.
# End of transcript or log.
