git-annex can be built without support for `git-annex webapp`,
and it seems that your updated build was configured that way.

This might be a mistake in the homebrew git-annex build,
or they might have disabled building with the webapp for some reason.

But, I suspect what caused this is a problem with a new version of cabal.
When I build git-annex (on linux) with cabal 3.4.1.0 and ghc 9.0.2,
it builds without the webapp. This is even though the webapp is supposed
to be build by default. Even `cabal configure -fWebapp`
does not cause it to build the webapp.
