git-annex can be built without support for `git-annex webapp`,
and it seems that your updated build ended up with that turned off.

It would be good to contact the homebrew developers and file a bug report
about this. From what I can see, their formula for git-annex does not
explicitly disable the webapp, but some problem may have caused it to get
disabled.

I suspect what caused this is a problem with a new version of cabal.
When I build git-annex (on linux) with cabal 3.4.1.0 and ghc 9.0.2,
it builds without the webapp. This is even though the webapp is supposed
to be build by default. Even `cabal configure -fWebapp`
does not cause it to build the webapp. Made a bug for that at
[[cabal_builds_without_assistant]].
