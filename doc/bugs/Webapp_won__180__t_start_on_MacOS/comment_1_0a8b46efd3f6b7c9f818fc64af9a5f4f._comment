First of all, look for and stop background git processes that are holding `/Users/Florian/FlosSoundPodcast/.git/index.lock`. Easiest way would be a restart. If the file persists a reboot, remove it.

Next you should set `remote.<name>.annex-ignore` on the gitlab remote because gitlab does not support git-annex.

What do the logs say after you've done that?
