I've committed a workaround to that cabal problem, so assuming that was
the cause of your problem, it will be fixed by the next git-annex release.

If something else caused it, the next git-annex release would
probably fail to build on homebrew. Which the homebrew developers will
follow up on.

So, I don't think this bug needs to be kept open any longer. Although you
will need to wait, or install git-annex by another means than homebrew, in
the meantime..
