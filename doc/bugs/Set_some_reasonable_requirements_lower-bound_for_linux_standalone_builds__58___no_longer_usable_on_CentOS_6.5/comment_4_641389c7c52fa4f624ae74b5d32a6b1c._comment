It might be possible to use stackage to get a build of all libraries from
the base haskell platform that are not too far out of date and don't break

building all libraries again. So, it would be a lot of CPU on an ongoing basis,
or a source of unfixed security bugs. 

And, I think it would not be entirely non-fragile. It's not exactly unheard
