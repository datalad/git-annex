I got stack working to build git-annex over the weekend, and it's now the
recommended way to build from source, since it avoids library churn issues
and automates everything. Upgrades can also be made to happen by increasing
the lts version in the stack.yaml file.

So using that and the haskell platform would be a way to get an even more
ancient distribution autobuilding. (But, I had to leave out xmpp and dbus
support to make the stack recipe work everywhere, so I don't want to make
the regular autobuilds built using stack.)
