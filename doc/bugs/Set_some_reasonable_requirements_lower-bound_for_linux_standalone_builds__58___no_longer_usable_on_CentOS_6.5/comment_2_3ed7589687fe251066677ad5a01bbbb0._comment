Actually, git-annex doesn't currently build on debian stable because it
needs a newer version of optparse-applicative. The new version builds just
fine on stable, so could easily be backported. I could probably get
git-annex building with the old version of optparse-applicative, with
sufficient ifdef pain, but a backport would be a nicer solution.
