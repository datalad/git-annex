Hmm, indeed, after further testing it seems like the increased time due to the duplicate branch seems to have been a random quirk, bleh :(

But shouldn't it theoretically be possible to optimize out much of the overhead of multiple very-similar (though not identical) branches though?

I've experimented around with ls-tree and cat-file in a bash script[1], and in this primitive implementation the running time seems to be considerably lower (~0.3s vs ~4s), with much less overhead for extra very-similar branches (~0.7s vs ~37s)

Am I missing some key element that's the reason for the time taken by git annex unused?
