git-annex should work ok with gpg version 2; there was one minor
incompatability vs gpg version 1, but it was ironed out in 2013.

If you build it from source, and have only gpg2 in PATH, and not gpg, it
will build a git-annex that runs gpg2.

You're using OSX.. the git-annex.app for OSX bundles its own gpg command,
and git-annex will use that one. I guess the brew build is built to use
gpg, and not gpg2. Would it then make sense for the brew package of
git-annex to depend on the package that contains gpg?

I don't really think it makes sense for git-annex to probe
around at runtime to find which of gpg and gpg2 is in PATH and pick which
one to use.

I suppose I could make git-annex look at git config gpg.program and use
that program when it's set. This would mirror the behavior of git.
