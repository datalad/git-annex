This is the initremote for it:

	git-annex initremote dandiarchive type=S3 encryption=none fileprefix=dandisets/ bucket=dandiarchive publicurl=https://dandiarchive.s3.amazonaws.com/ signature=anonymous host=s3.amazonaws.com datacenter=US importtree=yes

It started at 1 API call per second, but it slowed down as memory rapidly
went up. 3 gb in a few minutes, so I think there is definitely a memory
leak involved.
