Apparently gbrNextMarker is Nothing despite the response being truncted. So
git-annex is looping forever, getting the same first page each time, and
storing it all in a list.

I think this is a bug in the aws library, or I'm using it wrong.
It looks for a NextMarker in the response XML, but accoccording to
<https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_ListObjects.html>

> This element is returned only if you have the delimiter request parameter
> specified. If the response does not include the NextMarker element and it is
> truncated, you can use the value of the last Key element in the response as the
> marker parameter in the subsequent request to get the next set of object keys.
