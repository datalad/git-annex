No, it does not request versions from S3 when versioning is not enabled.

This feels fairly similar to
[[git-annex-import_stalls_and_uses_all_ram_available]].
But I don't think it's really the same, that one used versioning, and relied
on preferred content to filter the wanted files. 

Is the size of the whole bucket under the fileprefix, in your case, large
enough that storing a list of all the files (without the versions) could
logically take as much memory as you're seeing? At one point you said it
was 7k files, but later hundreds of thousands, so I'm confused about how
big it is.

Is this bucket supposed to be public? I am having difficulty finding an
initremote command that works.

It also seems quite possible, looking at the code, that it's keeping all
the responses from S3 in memory until it gets done with listing all the
files, which would further increase memory use.
I don't see any `O(N^2)` operations though.
