Trying the same command but with versioning=yes, I have verified that

* it does not have the same loop forever behavior
* it does use a lot of memory quite quickly

Going back to the unversioned command, I was able to reduce the memory use
by 20% by processing each result, rather than building up a list of results
and processing at the end. It will be harder to do that in the versioning
case, but I expect it will improve it at least that much, and probably
more, since it will be able to GC all the delete markers.
