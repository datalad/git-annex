### Please describe the problem.

I'm not sure if what I am experiencing is a bug, or just something I am doing incorrectly.

I am running into an issue with git-annex-import where it seems to stall, and use all available ram it can until the system terminates the process.

### What steps will reproduce the problem?

Here are my prep steps:

```sh
git init

git annex initremote s3-data type=S3 encryption=none port=443 protocol=https public=no \
importtree=yes versioning=yes host=$S3HOST bucket=$BUCKET fileprefix=primary_folder/

git annex wanted s3-data "exclude=subfolder-*/* and include=specialfilename1.*"

git annex import main --from s3-data --skip-duplicates --backend MD5E --jobs=4
```

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?

Originally, 10.20230321 on Debian Bookworm

I also tried 10.20231129 on Debian Bookworm with the same results

### Please provide any additional information below.

There are around 22000 files under the prefix I am trying to import from , and it amounts to around 115 GB.  However, most of that data is part of many seperate subdatasets underneath this one.  These have all worked fine and without any issue.

There are only 2 files I am actually trying to import, though there are several versions(about 70 each for a total of 140) of them at this location.  In this example, that is `specialfilename1.json` & `specialfilename1.csv`

When I use debug mode on the import command a lot of information is printed, but it mostly seems to amount to filenames that I would think would be excluded based on my `git-annex-wanted` command.  That output looks like the following until it stops, and then uses up what's available for RAM before inevitably terminating the process.

### Have you had any luck using git-annex before? (Sometimes we get tired of reading bug reports all day and a lil' positive end note does wonders)

In the past, on smaller versions of data structured the same way, this setup has worked, and I don't run into this issue.

I'm not exactly sure how to troubleshoot further and I am feeling stuck.  Is there something else I can be doing to see more info about what's happening behind the scenes?
