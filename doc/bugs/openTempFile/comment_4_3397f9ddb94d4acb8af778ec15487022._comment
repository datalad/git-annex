I suspect that this might be fixed in a current release of git-annex.

[[!commit 54ad1b4cfb1c8302f1b862cb2699ab9351e3eb5b]] made git-annex
fully support long filenames on windows. Some of the filenames in this bug
look long, and also it involved a network share path that I think that
commit would have likely improved git-annex's handling of.
