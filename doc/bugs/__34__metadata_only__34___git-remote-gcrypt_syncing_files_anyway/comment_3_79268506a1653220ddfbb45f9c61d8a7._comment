This was fixed in [[!commit fbf5045d4f17accde9e20fa528e52cb1dce61c47]]
for `git annex sync --content`

I don't remember the immediate cause of it being in a code that that the
webapp would call, but I did add a belt-and-suspenders fix at a lower level
which I'd hope would prevent the webapp from uploading anything in any
case.

Sounds like the webapp tries to queue transfers to a NoUUID remote, and
then presumably gives up before the object gets uploaded.

Looking at the code, calcSyncRemotes does not filter out NoUUID remotes
when populating syncDataRemotes. So, I've fixed that too now.
