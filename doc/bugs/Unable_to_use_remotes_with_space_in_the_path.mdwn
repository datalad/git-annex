### Please describe the problem.

Git annex can't use remotes with the type "file://" if the path contains spaces

### What steps will reproduce the problem?

- Create one repository with a space in the path (and initialize annex in it)
- Clone that repo to an other directory (and initialize annex also in that)
- add a file to the first repository in the annex way
- chdir to the second repository and try to get that file, it won't work (also after git pull or git sync pull)
