The most likely reason why a file would not be migrated is if its content
is not present. Can you verify that the files that didn't migrate do
have their content present, and migrate still doesn't do anything?

Note that it's possible in some situations for unlocked files to seem to
have their content present, but for git-annex to think that it's not
present. Eg, if it thinks that the file has gotten modified. Are all of the
affected files unlocked?

I am having difficulty reproducing this problem. I also think it
might be helpful if you showed what some of the un-migrated keys look
like (obscuring the actual hash is fine).
