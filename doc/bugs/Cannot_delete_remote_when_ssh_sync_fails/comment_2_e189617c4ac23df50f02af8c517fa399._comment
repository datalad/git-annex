Unfortunately, upgrading did not fix it. I suppose, a restart of the remote server (ssh was just installed) would have been necessary. Instead, I just deleted the repository on the remote.

Now my local repository was caught in a situation, where I couldn't upgrade the broken remote and I couldn't delete it either.

By recreating the repository on the remote, I finally was able to get rid of the broken link, but I think the proper solution would be to have the ability to remove unsynced repositories.

Thanks for the quick response!
