### Please describe the problem.

I have cloned via http and then went offline... decided to get a file, annex immediately tried to fetch it from origin which it couldn't have access to atm and marked it as annex-ignore.  IMHO it is a bit premature action, and annex should mark a remote as ignore only if it managed to reach the remote location and discovered that it has no annex there, not on a mere connectivity fluke


### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?
