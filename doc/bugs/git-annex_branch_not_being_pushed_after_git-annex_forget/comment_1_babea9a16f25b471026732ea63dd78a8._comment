"You may need to force git to push the branch to any git repositories not
running git-annex." -- git-annex-forget man page

I guess bitbucket doesn't accept pushes that replace an existing branch
with one with a disconnected history. git push --force should sort it out.

I'm not clear how this is a bug. Is there some change needed in the 
documentation or perhaps in git-annex sync?
