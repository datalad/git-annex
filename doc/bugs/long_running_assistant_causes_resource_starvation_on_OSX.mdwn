What steps will reproduce the problem?

leave the assistant running for multiple days

What is the expected output? 

Glorious git-annex enlightenment

What do you see instead?

After ~2-3 days, there are hundreds of zombied git processes and the system is unable to fork new processes. This has occurred on 3 differently hardware configured mac's (macbooks and imacs) all running Mountain Lion 10.8.2 Build 12C3006
In each case, once the system gets to this point, the only solution is forcing a reboot by holding down the power button as not even kill can spin up it's process.

What version of git-annex are you using?

    git-annex version: 3.20130122

On what operating system?

Mac OSX 10.8.2 Mountain Lion Build 12C3006

Please provide any additional information below.

I'm really not sure what to look for next. Happy to take suggestions.
