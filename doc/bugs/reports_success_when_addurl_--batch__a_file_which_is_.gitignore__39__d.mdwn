### Please describe the problem.

Reports success although file is not added to git, since ignored due to .gitignore

Although not sure yet if that is annex could actually take care about since probably annex stages those for 'add' command to git so wouldn't know right when addurl is called for a specific file?

### What steps will reproduce the problem?

see below

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?
