I wish it were possible to make `git add` add files in a locked state.
However, the smudge/clean interface git-annex uses to hook into `git add`
makes it impossible to do that.

This is why the documentation refers to "git-annex commands", which does
exclude `git add`. I've made that a little bit more explicit.
