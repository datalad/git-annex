It seems to me that if you don't want to repair your repository, you can just go into the webapp and disable all scheduled consistency check jobs.

If someone with this problem would like to run \"git annex repair\" at the console, and paste the output, perhaps I could then see why it thinks it needs to repair the repository. So far, I have nothing to go on, and no proof that this is a bug at all, and not just people with actually corrupted repositories that really do need to be repaired.
