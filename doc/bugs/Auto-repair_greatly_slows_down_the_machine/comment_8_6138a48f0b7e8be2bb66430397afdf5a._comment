The trouble with providing more information (outside of the logfile above) is that by the time I realize that there is a problem it is because git-annex has started to repair. Perhaps an option that makes git-annex write a ~/.git/annex/repair-reason.log file with the reason (ie. git fsck output etc.) for starting the repair could help?
