I came across the same problem today and I think I've found a workaround: [long paths on windows 10 - workaround](https://git-annex.branchable.com/forum/long_paths_on_windows_10_-_workaround/). It turns out Windows 10 allows enabling support for long paths with a single registry modification - unfortunately it is a system level setting, so it can potentially break some other programs.
