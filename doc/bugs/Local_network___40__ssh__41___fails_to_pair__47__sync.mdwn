### Please describe the problem.
I am trying to set out two computers on the same network to synchronise.

### What steps will reproduce the problem?
Install Git-Annex. Start the webapp. Try to connect. Enter a secret phrase on both. The Mythbuntu machine shows "Failed to sync with Inspiron 14z" (the laptop). The laptop shows "Pairing in progress" forever.

The machines can normally connect together passwordlessly through ssh with public key encryption. 

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?
Ubuntu Raring Version: 3.20121112ubuntu2 from the repos on my laptop.  Install version 4.20130627 from the PPA on Mythbuntu Precise (which I use as a home server).

### Please provide any additional information below.
From the the laptop, where I started the pairing:
[[!format sh """
# If you can, paste a complete transcript of the problem occurring here.
# If the problem is with the git-annex assistant, paste in .git/annex/daemon.log
$ git-annex webapp
