### Please describe the problem.

git-annex failed to update the local adjusted branch after `git annex drop` stopped abruptly. In turn, `git annex drop` stopped abruptly because a `git annex copy --from X --to Y` had to be stopped (CTRL-C) because of lack of space.

(Perhaps there are two issues here: `drop` being unable to cope with the unexpected situation, and the adjustment code being unable to cope with the weird stat left by `drop`'s abrupt interruption.)

### What steps will reproduce the problem?

```
$ git copy -J4 --from X --to Y
[notice that git-annex starts saying "not enough free space, need 27.87 MB more"]
[kill process with CTRL-C]
$ git annex drop dirF/
drop dirF/a/a1.txt ok
drop dirF/a/a2.txt ok
[...]
error: Your local changes to the following files would be overwritten by checkout:
	dirF/a/a1.txt
	dirF/a/a2.txt
	[...]

Aborting

  Updating adjusted branch failed.

`dirF/` is the directory whose files were being copied when the process has been stopped with `CTRL-C`.

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?

```
git-annex version: 10.20230215-gd24914f2a
[...]
operating system: linux x86_64
supported repository versions: 8 9 10
upgrade supported from repository versions: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10

```

### Have you had any luck using git-annex before? (Sometimes we get tired of reading bug reports all day and a lil' positive end note does wonders)

git-annex is too good. It so rarely causes problems that one does not develop the "git-annex troubleshooting muscle". :)
