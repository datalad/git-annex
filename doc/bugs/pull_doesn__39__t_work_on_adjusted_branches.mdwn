### Please describe the problem.

Pull works fine if both the source and destination repositories are on unadjusted branches.

If either of the repositories is on an adjusted branch, the pull operation does not copy anything.

### What steps will reproduce the problem?

git annex pull --allow-unrelated-histories pull-remote

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?

10.20231228-g5540f42e21afce6947d5410c5f18b178de6c336a

on Linux

### Please provide any additional information below.

[[!format sh """
# If you can, paste a complete transcript of the problem occurring here.
# If the problem is with the git-annex assistant, paste in .git/annex/daemon.log


# End of transcript or log.

### Have you had any luck using git-annex before? (Sometimes we get tired of reading bug reports all day and a lil' positive end note does wonders)

Yes, I am developing the easy-git-annex interface.
