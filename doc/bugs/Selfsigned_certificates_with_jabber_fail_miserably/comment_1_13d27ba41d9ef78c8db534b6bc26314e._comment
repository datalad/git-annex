Hmm, actually the XMPP library it's using does not fail on an invalid or self-signed cert. This is something that SSL using libraries sadly often get wrong, and yeah, I see I contacted the library author a while ago, and a \"sessionIsSecure\" has been added to it, which can be used to check if the cert was valid.

This leaves open the question of what's happening with you on the CCC server. Did you get an error message?
