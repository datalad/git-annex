AFAIKS, this is not a failure from a self-signed certificate. git-annex contacted the jabber server, accepted its certificate, and tried to log in. The jabber server rejected the login.

This kind of problem has in the past turned out to involve incompatabilities in SASL authentication using some newish authentication schemes. Often it's been a bug in the XMPP server that's tickled by the haksell TLS library. See for example <http://bugs.debian.org/717463>

So, what XMPP server is used by CCC?
