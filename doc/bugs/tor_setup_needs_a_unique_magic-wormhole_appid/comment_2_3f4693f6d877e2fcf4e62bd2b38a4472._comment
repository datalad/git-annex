based on this, we may have missed the window; there are 5 days until
Debian freezes, and it takes 10 days to get a change into testing.

It's still probably possible to get a change in, but it would need manual
approval. Guess it would come down to whether I could get the change
pre-approved for migration into Debian before releasing a git-annex
with that change.

(AFAIK Debian is the only distribution containing git-annex that's getting
ready to freeze it.)
