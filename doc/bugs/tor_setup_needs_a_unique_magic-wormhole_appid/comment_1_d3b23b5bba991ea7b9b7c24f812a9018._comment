Werner, I appreciate you filing this bug report. And I see magic-wormhole
0.9.1 is now available in testing so it will be in the next debian stable
release probably.

If I'm going to make this change, I need to do it ASAP. If git-annex
ships in Debian stable not using a wormhole app-id, then it pretty
much is going to need to continue not using an app-id forever.
(Which might not be a total disaster really; I don't know that a ton
of users are using this feature..)

The timeline for this is very tight now, unfortunately. (Pity that I have
been traveling and missed this until now.) I'm not sure
if, I released a git-annex today with this change, it would reach testing
in time for the freeze. I've pinged Richih to try to figure that out.
