### Please describe the problem.

For some reason, after a while I can't sync to any remotes (removeable drives, servers, etc.)


### What steps will reproduce the problem?

git annex sync, git annex assistant doing its autosync, etc.


### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?

Arch Linux, git annex 6.20160613-g1e4e6f4


### Please provide any additional information below.

[[!format sh """
# If you can, paste a complete transcript of the problem occurring here.

Typing git annex synx in a terminal gives me:

### Have you had any luck using git-annex before? (Sometimes we get tired of reading bug reports all day and a lil' positive end note does wonders)

Yes, this worked for ages, a year or more, it's awesome! Haven't plugged the removeable drives in for a while, now when I do this happens...
