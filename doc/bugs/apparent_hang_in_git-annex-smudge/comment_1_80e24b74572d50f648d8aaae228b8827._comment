Suggest you truss the `git-annex smudge` process and see what it's stuck
on. Looking at what file descriptors it has open would also be useful.

Unless you have prevented git-annex from upgrading your repository from
annex.version 8, it would normally have `filter.annex.process` configured,
and so `git status` would normally run `git-annex filter-process` rather
than `git annex smudge`.

So I suppose you either have an old repository version or have manually
unset `filter.annex.process`. Which it is seems like relevant information
to try to reproduce this.

Closest I can come to this bug is the deadlock that was fixed
by [[!commit d5451afc8f90832a58e78b17cfc461c24e417d52]] in 2020..
