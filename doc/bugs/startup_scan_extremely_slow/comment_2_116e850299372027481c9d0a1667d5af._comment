Note that v6 is still an experimental feature. I have not tested the
assistant with it much.

There is an issue documented on [[smudge]] where git can end up
unncessarily running the smudge filter after git-annex eg, gets a file,
or adds a file.

This could be related to that; after the assistant added a lot of
files here, the first `git status` run was quite slow as it ran the clean
filter on every file. Subsequent `git status` runs then went fast.

But, I don't know why this would make the startup scan slow; it
doesn't seem to use any git commands that would need to smudge files.
I tested by exporting `GIT_TRACE=1` and starting the assistant; the
startup scan went fast and there was nothing in .git/annex/daemon.log
about smudging.

Also, what are these changes that are apparently being committed to git
during your startup scan? I don't see such commits, either here.
