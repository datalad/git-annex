I exported GIT_TRACE and discovered that the assistant is re-adding to git the small files everytime I run it.
Below there's a link to the trace (with filenames removed). All the files are not matching the annex.largefiles expression (which is okay), there are no duplicates (i.e. it's not a \"I'm adding the same files in the same run\" problem) and all of them were already added the first time I ran the assistant and are not new to git and git-annex as they are not shown in \"git status\" or in \"git annex status\".

The daemon.log is pretty brief:

    [2016-04-24 12:49:31.129582] main: starting assistant version 6.20160418
    
      No known network monitor available through dbus; falling back to polling
    (scanning...) [2016-04-24 12:49:55.098167] Watcher: Performing startup scan
    [2016-04-24 12:58:51.667861] Committer: Committing changes to git

You can find the trace here: <https://gist.github.com/zarelit/815de89d972314f2e6495a2cdab91aca>

As you can see it almost takes ten minutes before reaching the first git-add.

My git-annex version is now 6.20160418 and the git one is 2.8.0, what version of git did you use when tracing? I can try to reproduce in a different environment (e.g. Debian stable with backports) if it can be useful.

Cheers,
David
