You're right, after the initial run there is no smudge filter overhead. I ran htop in tree view and got this result:

    git-annex-assistant (55-60%)
      |--> git-annex-assistant (six instances, a couple of those with load 20-40%, the others idling at 0%)
      |--> git ls-files (mostly idle)
      |--> git check-attr (mostly idle)
      |--> git check-ignore (mostly idle)
      |--> git cat-file (stuck at 40-60%)
