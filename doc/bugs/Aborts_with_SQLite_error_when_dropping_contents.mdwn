(Found the problem, so you might want to skip to the comments to see 
what's wrong.)

### Please describe the problem.

Trying to drop the contents of 131 files in a subdirectory, but it dies 
with an "sqlite worker thread crashed" error. The contents of one file 
is deleted, and then it dies. The files in that directory are exactly 1G 
(1000000000) bytes each.

There's no data loss here, it creates files in `.git/annex/journal/` 
which is added to the git-annex branch after a git annex sync. "git 
annex fsck --fast --quiet" is happy and finds no errors.

### What steps will reproduce the problem?

"git annex drop" with and without --force. Tried to copy one of the 
files to another server with Debian 8.7, and it's successfully dropped 
there. Same git-annex version.

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?

OS: Ubuntu 14.04.5 LTS

git-annex: 6.20161211-gc3ab3c668 (from 
`git-annex-standalone-amd64.tar.gz` in the annex at 
downloads.kitenet.net)

I have compiled the newest sqlite3 3.16.2 and placed it in 
/usr/local/bin/, just mentioning it because it's some kind of SQLite 
error. but executing the command with a PATH without /usr/local/bin 
makes no difference.

### Please provide any additional information below.

# If you can, paste a complete transcript of the problem occurring here.
# If the problem is with the git-annex assistant, paste in .git/annex/daemon.log

    $ git annex drop -d --force

### Have you had any luck using git-annex before? (Sometimes we get tired of reading bug reports all day and a lil' positive end note does wonders)

Indeed. All my stuff (around 3.5 terabytes) is stored in git-annex with 
at least three copies of each file on different disks and locations, 
spread over various hard disks, memory sticks, servers and you name it. 
Unused disk space is a waste, so I fill everything up to the brim with 
extra copies.

In other words, Git-Annex and I are very happy together, and I'd like to 
marry it. And because you are the father, I hereby respectfully ask for 
your blessing.
