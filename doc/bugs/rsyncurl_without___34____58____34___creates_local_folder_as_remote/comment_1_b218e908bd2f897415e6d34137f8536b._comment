I'd say this is intended behavior: I assume that the rsyncurl option is more less passed verbatim to rsync, and rsync can act on both local and remote paths. There is the possibility to use `rsync://` URLs, remote paths via SSH where the host and path are separated by a colon, and local paths.

The rsync special remote with local paths behaves a bit differently than the directory special remote, namely the rsyncurl is remembered (e.g. for autoenable) while the directory special remote does not remember the directory. There can be use-cases for both.

Besides, most of the time I think one would want to specify a remote directory with rsync, in which case the colon is necessary anyway.
