Thank you for your reply. And I see what you mean, although personally it still feels more that a bug than a feature. Trying to be a good internet citizen I exhausted every documentation I could find about it, and it still took me way too long to figure out something that simple. Maybe the manpage could reflect this bit of information in more detail - let's see if I can figure out, how to contribute patches ...
