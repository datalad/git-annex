Hi,

I have just tried it out again with the latest (20130501) version.

It is really nice to see you have been working on it, and it have improved tremendously!
The logging issue solved, and logrotates even, and it finished importing without crashing!

Remaining polishing things:

a)
The import time is not as good (as you write), it slowes itself down.
It is true the first 10000 files import in about an hour, but it finishes with everything
in 9 hours 20 minutes.
(on a normal laptop, the last 5000 file portion took more then 2 hours)

b) 
Every startup means rechecksuming everything, so it means the second start took also around 8-12 hours.
(I don't know exactly because it finished somewhere during the night, but it was longer then 8 hours)
I don't think rechecksuming is necessary at all, if the filename, size and date have not modified, 
then why rechecksuming (sha) it?


c) 
It is leaking. 
At the second startup, it reported it successfully added:
    Added 2375 files 5 files probe25366.txt

I have not touched the directory. ls confirms leaking:

    After first start (importing):
    annex_many/.git$ ls -lR |wc -l
    770199

    After second startup:
    annex_many/.git$ ls -lR |wc -l
    788351

d) Without ulimit raise, it does not work at all.
I think it could be solved by not watching each and every directory all the time.
Every users will likely have a working directory and some which he don't intend to touch/modify at all.
Some usecases: photo archiving, video archiving, finished work archiving, etc

All the above results with the stress test script. 
I would love to have a confirmation by a thirdparty.

Overall I'm impressed with the work you have done.

Best, 
 Laszlo
