    (It will also break file manager, dropbox, etc, which all use inotify in the same way.)

I beg to differ: with dropbox I handle my scrapbook(1) folder, 
which means 130 thousand files for over 2 years now without problem between three computers.

    ~/Dropbox/scrapbook$ ls -R -1 |wc -l
    130263

Don't get me wrong. I'm not complaining, I only give you a completely unrelated usecase, 
which requires also high number of files handling. And in that case the 81 thousand ulimit would not help either.
