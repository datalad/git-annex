rechecksuming: it seem like it is indeed fixed in the newest (2013.05.01) version downloaded from here:
http://downloads.kitenet.net/git-annex/linux/

I tried to add the big stress test dir as a secondary repository into git-annex (along with my real data dir), but 
seems like some library is not matching on my system, so some curl is complaining:

    curl: /lib/tls/i686/cmov/libc.so.6: version `GLIBC_2.12' not found (required by /home/user/Desktop/down/git-annex.linux//usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/libldap_r-2.4.so.2)

I'm on ubuntu 10.04.

And the log file is starting to fill up, so maybe once a problem occur, it should only write into the log file once.

I will redone this stress test next week, without combining with any repository.
Thank you very much for your response, I do appreciate you are bothering/dealing with my complains!:)

Best, 
 Laszlo
