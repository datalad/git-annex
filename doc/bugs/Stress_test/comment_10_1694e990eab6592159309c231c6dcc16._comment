My estimate was indeed slightly optimistic. While I did not run the whole import, it did run slower for the later batches of files. As far as I can see, that slowdown is just because git gets slower as it has more files. So nothing I can do about it. git-annex is now scaling well itself, though.

Re checksumming on startup: There was a bug that caused the assistant to re-checksum all direct mode files on startup. This bug was fixed in version 4.20130417. If you're using that version and still see it re-checksumming files, please file a new bug report about it, as this is not intended behavior.

You seem to be saying that the assistant is failing to add some files, and then when stopped and restarted it finds and adds them. I don't quite know how that would happen. If you can provide a test case that I can use to reproduce that behavior, I will try to debug it.
