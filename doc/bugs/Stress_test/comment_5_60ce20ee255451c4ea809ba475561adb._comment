I found a bug in the webapp thanks to this stress test. When inotify goes over limit, it displays a message about how to fix it..
But it displays that message over and over for each file. The result is a constantly updating very large web page. 

Unless you tell me differently, I'm going to assume that's what the GUI crash you referred to was, since it can make a web browser very slow.

I've fixed this problem. Now when it goes over limit, the webapp will just display this:
