Hi,

First of all thank you for your time looking into my bug. I try to research more from my side.

The 'Resource exhausted' bugreport 
(which lost its title, and could not click on it to add this testcase as a comment)
was tested on real data, my own working directory (a copy of it).
This bugreport is tested on the output of this small shell script.

None of them succeeded to import, and I quickly assumed it is the exact same.

So I will test again, raising the ulimit to 81920, and report.

    The main problem with this directory tree is that it has more directories than inotify can watch, in the default configuration

I would be perfectly fine if I could configure git-annex to sync those directory only once a month or once a week
(ie. check for update once a week). So no need to watch it real time, those are my archived work files.

    I don't think that 51 thousand directories is a particularly realistic amount for any real-world usage of git-annex.

Well, it is not 25000 dir in a single a folder, but rather something like this:

    work_done/2009/workname/back9/back8/back7/back6/back5

Where each 'backX' contains a whole backup the work until it. 
So the directory structure is a bit more deep, and no 25000 subdirectory in a single dir. 
But the overall numbers are right.

If I could somehow mark this **work_done** dir to not sync real time (or work_done/2008,work_done/2009,work_done/2010,work_done/2011,work_done/2012 subdir in them), 
then my whole issue would vanish.

I only want to use git-annex to have a backup of this directory. 
In case of laptop theft, or misfunction I could have a backup. 
I dont need live sync anywhere, I have directories which I know I will not touch for months.

Best,
 Laszlo
