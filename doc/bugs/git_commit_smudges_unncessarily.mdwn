### Please describe the problem.

git commit smudges unlocked files in the index when they were already smudged with git status.

### What steps will reproduce the problem?

```
for i in {1..200}; do echo $i > $i; done
git init; git annex init; git config annex.thin true; git config annex.crippledfilesystem true; git config annex.addunlocked true; git annex add .; git status; time git commit -m .
```

git commit should take less than a second but takes several seconds to smudge the files in the index.

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?

Through bisection, the problem was found to be introduced in [[!commit 428c91606b434512d1986622e751c795edf4df44]]. Problem occurs both in Linux and WSL1.

### Have you had any luck using git-annex before? (Sometimes we get tired of reading bug reports all day and a lil' positive end note does wonders)

git-annex has worked wonderfully for managing my files across different machines and cloud storage services.
