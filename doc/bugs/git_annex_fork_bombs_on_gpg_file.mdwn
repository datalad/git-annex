### Please describe the problem.
git-annex goes into a loop of I think Haskell's createProcess function and causes the entire operating system to starve of process creation.

### What steps will reproduce the problem?
The last file git-annex was processing was tinco.gpg, my gpg key exported with
  
   gpg --export mail@tinco.nl --output tinco.gpg 

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?
4.20130516-g8a26544 on OSX

I had a remote setup using bup.

### Please provide any additional information below.
Unfortunately to fix the problem I have deleted the entire git repository and made a new init in the same directory, this time without the gpg file. Everything seems to be working now.

What I remember about the log file is that the last thing it said was something along the lines of 

add tinco.gpg

.. (gpg) (gpg) (gpg) (gpg) (gpg) (gpg) (gpg) (gpg) (gpg) (gpg) (gpg) (gpg) (gpg) (gpg) (gpg) (gpg) (gpg) (gpg) (gpg) (gpg) (gpg) (gpg) (gpg) (gpg) (gpg) (gpg) (gpg) (gpg) (gpg) (gpg) ..etc

recv (resource unavailable or something) ..
