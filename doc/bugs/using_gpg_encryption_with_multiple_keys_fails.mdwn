### Please describe the problem.
git-annex assistant uses wrong key if multiple are available.  If there is only one gpg available it works without issue.

### What steps will reproduce the problem?

I tried to creating a new key through cli or assistant UI.  I also tried to select preexisting key but it always appears to choose the initial key.  Log below is creating a new key through assistant UI.

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?
git-annex version: 5.20140709-gc75193e on linux amd64 & os x 10.9.4

### Please provide any additional information below.
