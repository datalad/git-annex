I suppose it would be useful to look at the output of `git log git-annex..13d365f16ffdb5a393f66362b840d3f21bb4c59c --oneline -n1`

Either than command is outputting a huge amount of stuff, or it's actually causing git (not git-annex) to use a lot of memory. Not sure which it is from the description.
