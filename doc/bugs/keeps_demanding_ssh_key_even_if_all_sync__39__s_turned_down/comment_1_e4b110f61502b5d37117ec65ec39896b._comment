I'm having a hard time following what you're trying to say here.

What is the bad behavior you are seeing? How does the fsck output you
posted relate the the problem? What git remotes are configured? What is the
contents of your .git/config? How did you disable the vagus repository?
Have you restarted the assistant after disabling it?
