### Please describe the problem.

Syncing with a special remote "borg" seems to fail - sometimes, but not always.

### What steps will reproduce the problem?

I honestly do not know the steps to reproduce this issue. I wish I could. There is one call exiting with a failure (see the debug log), although I don't know which command is being executed before that.

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?

git-annex version: 10.20240129

Debian Stable 12.5

### Please provide any additional information below.

### Have you had any luck using git-annex before? (Sometimes we get tired of reading bug reports all day and a lil' positive end note does wonders)

Definately, git-annex is my Nr.1 tool for managing my files. There is no comparable alternative out there as of right now. Keep up the good work!
