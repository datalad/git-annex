### Please describe the problem.
I've noticed that adding a modified file to a version 6 repo will throw a number of errors if 'git annex add' is executed three or more directories deep from the git directory.
Though it throws a number of errors, it seems the file is still added normally.
I have also experienced a problem whereby adding a file will replace it with its key (as if I had run 'git annex drop').
I'm not sure if that problem is related.

### What steps will reproduce the problem?
In order to cause the exception, a file already in the repo has to be unlocked, edited, and re-added; this re-adding must take place from three levels below the git directory.
Here is a minimal working example:

    git init
    git annex init --version=6
    mkdir -p 1/2/3
    touch 1/2/3/foo
    git annex add 1/2/3/foo
    git annex sync
    git annex unlock 1/2/3/foo
    echo "bar" >> 1/2/3/foo
    cd 1/2/3
    git annex add foo 

Specifically, trying to run 'git annex add foo' will result in the following errors being thrown:

    fatal: '../1/2/3/foo' is outside repository
    fatal: '../1/2/3/foo' is outside repository
    fatal: '../1/2/3/foo' is outside repository
    fatal: '../1/2/3/foo' is outside repository
    fatal: '../1/2/3/foo' is outside repository
    fatal: '../1/2/3/foo' is outside repository
    fatal: '../1/2/3/foo' is outside repository
    fatal: '../1/2/3/foo' is outside repository
    fatal: '../1/2/3/foo' is outside repository
    fatal: '../1/2/3/foo' is outside repository
    fatal: '../1/2/3/foo' is outside repository

    error: external filter git-annex smudge --clean %f failed 1
    error: external filter git-annex smudge --clean %f failed
    add foo ok
    (recording state in git...)


### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?
I'm currently running version 6.20160720-g9f0428e on Arch Linux (x86), though I've experienced this problem since at least February.

### Have you had any luck using git-annex before? (Sometimes we get tired of reading bug reports all day and a lil' positive end note does wonders)
I've been happily using git-annex on my laptop and server for almost a year; it's saved me a great deal of time and effort.
Thanks for all your work!
