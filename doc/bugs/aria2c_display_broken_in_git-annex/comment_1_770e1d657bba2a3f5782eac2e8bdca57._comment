This is because aria2c detects it's not outputting to a terminal, so it
stops using \r for progress displays. You can get the same effect by piping
aria2c to less. There does not seem to be any switch to force console-style
output.

The only solution would be the complexity of making git-annex use a pty
internally, or just not showing aria2c progress output (or not intercepting
it for metering).
