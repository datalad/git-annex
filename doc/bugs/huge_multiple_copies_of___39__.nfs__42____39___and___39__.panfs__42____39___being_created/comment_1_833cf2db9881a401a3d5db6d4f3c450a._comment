git-annex uses posix file locking to avoid scenarios that could
otherwise result in data loss when dropping a file. 

This indeed involves keeping a file open and locked while removing it.

Since NFS's posix file locking support ranges from poor to completely
broken, it's not wise to use git-annex over NFS at all. It's much nicer
to use it locally, with a git remote accessing the file server over
eg, ssh.

I can't see any changes to git-annex that could improve its handing
of NFS, unless there's a good way to detect a NFS filesystem and make
`git annex init` refuse to set up a repository there.
