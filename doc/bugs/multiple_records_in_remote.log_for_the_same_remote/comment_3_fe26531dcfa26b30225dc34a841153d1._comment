Beyond a warning, it would be possible to autoenable both, but use a new
name for the second one. Although that could lead to its own problems.

It occurs to me that it's also possible for autoenable of a special remote
to overwrite/change the git config of a regular git remote that has the
same name. This would be unlikely except in the case of one named "origin",
but it could happen, just needs the git remote to have been added before
git-annex inits. That seems like a problem that ought to be avoided too.
