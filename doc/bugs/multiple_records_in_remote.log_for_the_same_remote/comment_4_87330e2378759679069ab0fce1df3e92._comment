I've added a warning in these cases, and it will avoid autoenabling a special
remote when there is already a remote with the same name. 

In the case of two special remotes with the same name that are both set to
autoenable, it's essentially random which gets enabled first and so "wins".

Decided against autoenabling it with a different name, because: a) There's
the potential that the name it comes up with is actually the name of
another special remote that is also due to be autoenabled. b) It seems like
potentially confusing behavior for there to be a remote with a different
name than that usually used for a particular special remote.
