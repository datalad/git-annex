dang -- doing that dance of remove and re-enableremote actually addressed it (I did feel that we had similar case before) -- it removed duplicate entries in `remote.log`.

and looking at https://github.com/OpenNeuroDatasets/ds000001/blob/git-annex/remote.log -- there is no duplicates.

So it feels like it is just a matter of git-annex to be able to somehow trigger fixup for a user without needing to do the whole investigation and dance of remove/re-enableremote?  or at least to warn somehow whenever such a situation detected
