Note that this does not affect the number of commits made by `addurl` generally
eg when adding multiple urls with --batch from the web.

Also, I don't think that the commits you picked out and showed necessarily
correspond to one-another. The state being recorded in the commit in the 1st
run is not the same as the state that gets recorded by the two commits in the
2nd run. Unless, there is an actual behavior change that eg, leaves the file
present in a repository that it was not present in before. 

In the first run the commit shows key
MD5E-s5--db87ebcba59a8c9f34b68e713c08a718.dat ends up recorded as present in
datalad-archives but not in the local repository. In the second run, the
commits show that the same key ends up recorded present in both repositories.
