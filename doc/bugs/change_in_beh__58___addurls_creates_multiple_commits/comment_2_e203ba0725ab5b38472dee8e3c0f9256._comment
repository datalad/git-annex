Bisected to [[!commit 780367200b14d532f745079dfa09ffaa214d0a84]],
"remove dead nodes when loading the cluster log".

Replacing `loadClusters` with a noop on top of that commit gets the test
suite passing again.

Since nothing in `loadClusters` involves the location log at all, I think
this must come down to a difference in when/if git-annex starts reading
from the git-annex branch. There could be git-annex commands that didn't
used to read from the branch before, that now do. Which might mean merging
in other git-annex branches at different points in time than happened
before, which I suppose can result in an additional commit.

Unfortunately, I can't avoid the early `loadClusters` for reasons explained
in that commit.

Anyway, I doubt this will result in a lot of additional commits.
