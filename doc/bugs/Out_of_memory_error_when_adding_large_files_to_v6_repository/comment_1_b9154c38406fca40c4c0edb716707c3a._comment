Unfortunately, git add tries to load the whole file content
into memory (or at least allocates a buffer for it all),
even if it's only going to stream it through the clean filter
used in v6 mode, and even though the git-annex smudge
filter reads the file content from disk itself.

I submitted a patch to git over a year ago, that IIRC fixes this kind of
problem, but it was not accepted. Getting an updated version of that patch
accepted into git is the main blocker for v6 repositories to not be
experimental.

[[todo/smudge]] documents this problem. I'm going to close this bug
as it's a duplicate of stuff discussed there.
