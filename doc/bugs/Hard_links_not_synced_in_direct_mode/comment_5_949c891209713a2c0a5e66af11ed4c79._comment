To fix [[Problems_with_syncing_gnucash]], I have made some changes to how hard links are dealt with.

Assistant will now notice when a hard link is created, and add the same thing to git it would add for any other file. The hard link is not propigated to other repositories.

Files remain hard linked locally. This means that a change to one will affect the contents of the other. The assistant, lacking a hard link cache, will not notice this, and so will commit the change to the file that was written to, but not commit its hard link. Running `git annex add` manually (or restarting the assistant) will make it finally notice the other file has changed. 

So, the assistant still does not keep hard links in sync on an ongoing basis. This bug is still unsolved.
