### Please describe the problem.
git annex fsck and git annex get are showing (false?) sha256sum failed messages on Android with the 2016-07-19 android 5.0 build. I haven't seen this before but have been using git-annex on Android, with the same repository for a year, so I'd guess regression.

I ran fsck on the files on another machine (Watt: Debian testing, 6.20160511-1) and no errors occur. Note that isn't the machine that the Android tablet transfers from (Einstein: Debian stable + backports, 5.20151208-1~bpo8+1). The Android shell didn't have a sha256sum command, but it had an md5 commandâ€”and I tried one of the files (Management Report.pdf) and the md5 matches on both Watt and the Android tablet.

I also ran git annex fsck on Einstein (the entire repository, since it's a bare repo) and the only problem it found was a single (different) key with an insufficient number of trusted copies.

So I think the file is actually fine.

### What steps will reproduce the problem?
Unsure. Dropping and re-getting those files didn't help; it showed a sha256 error with get too.

The only difference I can think of between the files that fail and work is the size:

### Have you had any luck using git-annex before? (Sometimes we get tired of reading bug reports all day and a lil' positive end note does wonders)

Yes, I've been using git annex for I think a year and a half now, on several repositories. It works pretty well. I have a total of around 315GB and 23K annexed keys across them (counting each annex only once, even though they're cloned on a bunch of machines).
