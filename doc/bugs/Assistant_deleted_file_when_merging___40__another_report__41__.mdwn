### Please describe the problem.
A couple of days ago I merged a v5 repo with an OLD one (see [1]) - both on the local drive.  I *thought* it all went relatively smoothly until I tried to find some files that existed pre-merge.

**All** files from before the merge were deleted as part of the merge commit.  Fortunately, they seem to be available when I do `git annex unused`


---

Any thoughts on how I would recover the removed files?  Some have a web remote, so doing it by hand for all 300ish would be a PITA.

---

[1] Last commit was Dec 2013, and `.git/config` has `annex.version = 3`


### What steps will reproduce the problem?

Ah.  That's hard as I can't remember exactly what I did...  :-/

1. Find an OLD repo and merge with a current one using the assistant.
2. I *think* I used the webapp and changed repositories to the old one (that was marked as `unwanted`).
3. I *think* I stopped and restarted the assistant a few times.  (It was a loooooong merge).

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?

- git-annex version: 6.20170520 (at time of merge)
- git-annex version: 6.20170818 (currently)
- Operating system: macOS Sierra v10.12.6
- Installed by: homebrew

### Please provide any additional information below.

I suspect this is a bug that can't be reproduced easily.

### Have you had any luck using git-annex before? (Sometimes we get tired of reading bug reports all day and a lil' positive end note does wonders)
