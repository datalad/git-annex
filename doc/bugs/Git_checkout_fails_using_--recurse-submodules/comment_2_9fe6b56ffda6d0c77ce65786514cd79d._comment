I don't think it's possible to improve git-annex's behavior here much.

git-annex could avoid converting .git file to a directory, but then the
git-annex symlinks would point to the wrong place. It could, when in a
submodule, make the git-annex symlinks point up to ../.git/modules/sub/,
but then the links would not work when the submodule was cloned by itself,
or when the submodule was located at a different directory level.

The only other thing git-annex can do is avoid using symlinks at all,
eg adjusted unlocked branches. I don't think it's a good trafeoff to do
that. On the one hand, there is this minor issue with submodule deletion,
and the need to avoid using `--recurse-submodules` and instead do `git
submodule update`. On the other hand, unlocked annexed files use 2x
as much disk space.
