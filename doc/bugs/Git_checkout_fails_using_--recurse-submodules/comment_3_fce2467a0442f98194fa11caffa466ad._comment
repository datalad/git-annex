Well, there is `git-annex adjust --fix` now. So in theory, git-annex in a
submodule could leave .git a file and enter an adjusted fixed branch, and
when generating that branch, make the annex object symlinks point to
`../.git/modules/sub/`

Then git would commit the ref of the adjusted branch as the submodule.
So checking it out elsewhere would need to either replicate that same
commit sha  with `git-annex adjust --fix` again (doable but tricky),
or that ref would need to be pushed.

The user would also need to use `git-annex sync` in the submodule
after making changes if they want to propatate them out of the adjusted
branch to the main branch.
