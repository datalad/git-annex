Notice where it says:

AFAICS, every one of those branches still refers to the migrated keys. For one thing, `git annex migrate` makes changes, but it doesn't commit them to master. And then you need to wait until the other remote are updated to.

Also, there's not really any point in worrying about getting rid of migrated keys, since `git-annex migrate` hard links the new key to the old key, so the old ones don't take up any additional disk space.

In other words: This should take care of itself as you continue to use the repository.
