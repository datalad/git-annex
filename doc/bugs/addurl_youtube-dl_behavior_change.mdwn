I have often used a terminal window and prefixed my input with "git-annex
addurl" then drag links to the window for pasting.  Often, I have to press the
up-arrow and run the command again.  The addurl behavior with urls that are
already locally present, quvi responds "ok."  However, when repeating a command
using yt-dl, when the url is already local, yt-dl refuses to overwrite, yet
returns "failed."  I didn't know if you were aware of this.  This isn't a
show-stopper, but just something I noticed.  I generally do "addurl" manually.
