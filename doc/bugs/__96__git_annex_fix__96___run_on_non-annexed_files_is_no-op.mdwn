### Please describe the problem.

`git annex fix` only works on files that have been annexed, already.
While that's a safety measure of course, an option like `--force` or similar would be nice if one is shuffling around data by hand.

### What steps will reproduce the problem?

Please see [[bugs/__96__git_annex_add__96___changes_mtime_if_symlinks_are_fixed_in_the_background/]] for details; I didn't want to spam exactly the same output twice.

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?

git-annex 4.20130709 on Debian unstable i386 and x64.
