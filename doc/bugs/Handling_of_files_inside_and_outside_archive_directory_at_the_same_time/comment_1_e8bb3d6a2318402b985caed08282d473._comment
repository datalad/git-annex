This is a known problem.

It seems possible to fix it for direct mode. After all, direct mode tracks all files associated with a key, so it could expose this to preferred content expressions, and the expression check if any of the associated files was in an archive directory.

Unsure how to deal with it in indirect mode. Short of making indirect mode do all the same tracking direct mode does, or otherwise build a key to file lookup table.
