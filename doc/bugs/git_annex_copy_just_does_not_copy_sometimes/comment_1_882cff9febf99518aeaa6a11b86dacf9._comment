Notice that `git annex findkeys --not --in origin-storage` will list all keys that are locally available, but not in `origin-storage`, while `git annex copy --not --in origin-storage --to origin-storage` will copy over all locally available files not in `origin-storage` _that are part of the currently checked out worktree_. I.e. one works on keys, while the other works on paths.

This means your `findkeys` into `copy` pipe is not equivalent to the plain copy command.

Instead, what the copy command does copy is what `git annex find --not --in origin-storage` would return.

More concretely, if no file in the current worktree points to `MD5E-s7265--9885654f68b8e72de9b681c8783b3bf8.yaml` then what you observe is expected. If such a file does exist, then this is indeed a bug, I think.
