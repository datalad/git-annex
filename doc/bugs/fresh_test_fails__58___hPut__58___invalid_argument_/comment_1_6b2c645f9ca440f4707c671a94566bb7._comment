Reproduced with LANG=C:

      ./Test/Framework.hs:86:
      initremote failed with unexpected exit code (transcript follows)
      initremote foo (encryption setup) (to gpg keys: 129D6E0AC537B9C7)
      git-annex: .git/annex/othertmp/remote.log: withFile: invalid argument (cannot encode character '\132')
      failed
      (recording state in git...)
      initremote: 1 failed

Not quite the same error but almost certianly the same problem.

I've confirmed this is caused by 
[[!commit 3742263c99180d1391e4fd51724aae52d6d02137]]
