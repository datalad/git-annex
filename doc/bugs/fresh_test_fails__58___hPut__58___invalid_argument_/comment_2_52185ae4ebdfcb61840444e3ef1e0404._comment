Will probably need to revert the Remote/Helper/Encryptable.hs part of that
commit. 

What is happening here is, encodeBS is failing when run on the String from
a SharedPubKeyCipher. That String comes from Utility.Gpg.genRandom and is
literally a bunch of random bytes. So it's not encoded with the filesystem
encoding. And it really ought to be a ByteString of course, but since it's
not, anything involving encoding it fails.

That's why the old code had this comment:

	{- Not using Utility.Base64 because these "Strings" are really
	 - bags of bytes and that would convert to unicode and not round-trip
	 - cleanly. -}

And converted that String to a ByteString via `B.pack . s2w8`, which avoids this problem.

What an ugly thing. Really ought to be fixed to use ByteString throughout. 
But for now, let's revert.
