After installing git-annex from Archlinux repositories, it works again. 

For some reason, I had installed git-annex-standalone (10.20220121-1)
With git-annex (10.20251114-2) everything works as intended.

git-annex version: 10.20251114-geeb21b831e7c45078bd9447ec2b0532a691fe471

Sorry for the noise, should have done this before.

Best, Scinu
