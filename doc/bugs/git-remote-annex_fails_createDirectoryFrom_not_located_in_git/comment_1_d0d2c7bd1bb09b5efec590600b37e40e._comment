Bisected the reversion to [[!commit 835283b86240ef4b68c44f4332ac1b644e08e49f]].

A createAnnexDirectory call gets added to fileRetriever in that commit,
and that uses createDirectoryUnder. In the case of git-remote-annex,
the destination file is not under the .git directory, and so it fails.
Before this commit, it was retrieved to under the .git directory
and then renamed into place, and that rename didn't care if the destination
was not under .git.
