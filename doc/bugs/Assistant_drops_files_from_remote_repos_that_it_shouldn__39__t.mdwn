### Please describe the problem.

git-annex assistant starts to drop files in remote repos, even when they are set to manual.

### What steps will reproduce the problem?


Create 3 repos:

* A -- standard, archive
* m1 -- standard, manual
* m2 -- standard, manual

System has 3 files annexed: file1, file2, file3. Repo "A" has all three files, m1 has none, m2 has file3.

So, while in m1:

    m1 $ git annex find --want-drop --in m2
    file3

file3 shouln't be dropped from m2. There is no reason to do this. m2 is set as manual, and it shouldn't be touched in any case.

Now, let's get this file in m1:

    m1 $ git annex get file3
    get file3 (from m2...) ok
    (Recording state in git...)
    m1 $ git annex find --want-drop --in m2

So when 'file3' is present in local repo, it's not going to be dropped from m2.

I guess that rule 'present' works in local repo context while 'drop' acts on remote files.


### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?

I'm using latest version in Debian Jessie (5.20141024) on amd64 and armhf. I've also reproduced the bug with manually compiled 5.20141105-g8d8b248 on amd64.
