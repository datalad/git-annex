### Please describe the problem.

I'm using Git Annex on Windows and Linux.

On Windows - Git annex is using `adjusted/main(unlocked)` branch that is syncing to `main`. This setup worked reliably for a few weeks

A couple days ago `adjusted/main(unlocked)` branch stopped syncing to `main`. Currently log looks like this:

```
commit C (HEAD -> adjusted/main(unlocked))
Date:   Wed Feb 8 07:47:49 2023 -0500
    New commit on windows - no longer syncing to main

commit B
Date:   Mon Jan 30 21:09:41 2023 -0500
    git-annex adjusted branch

commit A (origin/synced/main, origin/main, synced/main, main)
Date:   Mon Jan 30 21:09:41 2023 -0500
    Last commit before sync stopped working
```

I've tried (several times):

```
git annex sync
commit
On branch adjusted/main(unlocked)
nothing to commit, working tree clean
ok
```

```
git annex sync --cleanup
cleanup local ok
```

So `sync` is reporting that there is nothing to do, but `main` branch is not syncing. I've tried adding a new commit to `adjusted/main(unlocked)` and the did not help with restoring sync. Not sure what else to try.

Hoping to figure out what caused this. Help is much appreciated!

### What steps will reproduce the problem?

Git annex Windows repo stoped syncing. I don't know what caused this. It worked reliably for a few weeks

### Have you had any luck using git-annex before? (Sometimes we get tired of reading bug reports all day and a lil' positive end note does wonders)
