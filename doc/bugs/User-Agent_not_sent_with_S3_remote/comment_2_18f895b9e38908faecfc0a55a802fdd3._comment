Drat, no followup. I seem to remember hearing about a S3 implementation
that either needed any User-Agent header (currently, git-annex does not
send one to S3), or perhaps a specific User-Agent. But I don't remember
details.

Anyway, I have implemented a patch to the aws library that can be used for
this.
