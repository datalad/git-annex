### Please describe the problem.

I have a directory remote with importtree=yes.  In that remote, I have some symlinks that are broken.  (Long story; this is a file server and they work on the system that has mounted them, but are broken here.)

### What steps will reproduce the problem?

I've added it with `git config remote.source.annex-tracking-branch main:$REPO`.  When I run `git annex sync`, I get:

```
commit 
On branch adjusted/main(unlocked)
nothing to commit, working tree clean
ok
list source 
git-annex: Unable to list contents of source: [redacted]: getFileStatus: does not exist (No such file or directory)
failed
git-annex: sync: 1 failed
```

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?

8.20210223-2 on Debian

### Please provide any additional information below.

I would like git-annex to either:

1. Store the symlink as a symlink, or
2. Ignore bad symlinks

### Have you had any luck using git-annex before? (Sometimes we get tired of reading bug reports all day and a lil' positive end note does wonders)
