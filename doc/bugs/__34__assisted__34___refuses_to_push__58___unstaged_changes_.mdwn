### Please describe the problem.

This is a repo under `git-annex assistant` control and was committing and pushing fine but then stopped... there were many other oddities (some files were `git rm`ed and never committed back etc), but now it is at the level of git on remote I guess, so likely going through `git-annex filter-process` -- claims to have unstaged changes when `git status` says none:


```shell
reprostim@reproiner:/data/reprostim$ git push typhon

On branch master
Your branch is ahead of 'reproiner/master' by 2906 commits.

nothing to commit, working tree clean

```

how to troubleshoot in the future?

workaround done: pushed as another branch which I then just "merged" (was fast-forward) locally (on typhon).



### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?


```
reprostim@reproiner:/data/reprostim$ git annex version | head -n 1
git-annex version: 10.20251114-1~ndall+1
reprostim@reproiner:/data/reprostim$ ssh typhon git annex version | head -n 1
git-annex version: 10.20250416
