What CPU is this happening with?

git-annex generates uuids using <https://hackage.haskell.org/package/uuid>
and the V4 uuid uses <https://hackage.haskell.org/package/entropy>,
which in turn uses RDRAND when available. 

So if your CPU supports RDRAND, it seems the CPU must have a broken
random number generator! Or there's a bug in that software stack
somewhere.
