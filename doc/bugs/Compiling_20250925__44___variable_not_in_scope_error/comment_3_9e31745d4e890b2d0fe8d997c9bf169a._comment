Looks to me like arch is no longer stuck on the old 9.4.8 ghc but has a
slightly newer 9.6.6. Which is the same as Debian stable.

So, I am probably going to make git-annex only support back to that
version, to simplify things.

Please let me know if I have misunderstood the situation in arch land..
