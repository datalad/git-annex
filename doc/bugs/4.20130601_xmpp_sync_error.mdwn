4.20130601 xmpp sync error.

setup: A debian machine, with indirect fresh annex, android galaxy s3 with a
fresh direct annex, both running ga-20130601.

steps:
- Start assistant on both, add jabber account to both.
- Add box.com account on desktop with no encryption, (now correctly shows up on android, wasn't the case with 20130521).
- Add hello.txt on desktop repo, filename is now visible on android, but content is not.
- Add greeting.txt on desktop, nothing shows up on android, content still missing for hello.txt
- Webapp shows uploading messages, but no errors.
- Manually checking box.com confirms that files have been uploaded.
