I've had a similar problem when the location of my annex was too deep. Windows only allows 256 char filenames. Git annex takes up a fair bit of that by storing files named according to their hash. I worked around the problem by creating my repo at the drive root and then creating a \"junction\" between the place where I wanted it to be and that location. It seems to work now.
