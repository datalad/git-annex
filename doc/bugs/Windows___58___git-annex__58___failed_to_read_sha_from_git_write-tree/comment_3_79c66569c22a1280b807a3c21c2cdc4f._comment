Windows certianly does cause problems with its short path limits. The
SHA512 hash backend is known to not work at all on windows, for example.

However, recent versions of git-annex use relative paths to files, so it
shouldn't much matter if they're run in a directory deep in a tree; it'll
refer to '.git/foo' rather than 'c:/verylong/path/to/.git/foo'

Also, a long path is certianly not the cause of

	DeleteFile ".git\\objects\\pack\\pack-c53ea32e9514b6dda95af1d8d879d91d32240d76.idx": permission denied

Since the path there is relative, is plenty short to not bother Windows's
tiny mind, and there's clearly some sort of permission problem preventing
this user from modifying this file.
