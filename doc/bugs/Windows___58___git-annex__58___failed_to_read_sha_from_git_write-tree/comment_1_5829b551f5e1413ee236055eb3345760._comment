Why can't you read files in your git repository? This must be due to some
permissions issue, etc. I know nothing about permissons in Windows, so
can't offer any useful advice, beyond the fact that, for git (or git-annex)
to work, you need to be able to read all the files in the git repository.

You may also have some form of corruption of the files in the repository.
Perhaps your disk is going bad or something?

I don't see any indications of a git-annex bug here.
