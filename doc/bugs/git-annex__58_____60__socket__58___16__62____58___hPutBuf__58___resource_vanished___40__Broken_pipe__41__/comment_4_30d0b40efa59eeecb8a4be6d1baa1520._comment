I tried, as an experiment, killing on of the `git cat-file` child processes of the assistant. As hypothesized, that led to the same thing I saw logged before.

So, why might git commands be dying, and which commands? It would be pretty easy for git-annex to detect git cat-file dying, and restart it. Other commands would be more difficult. Still this might be a git bug which would best be fixed there. It would be good to get a core dump from git.
