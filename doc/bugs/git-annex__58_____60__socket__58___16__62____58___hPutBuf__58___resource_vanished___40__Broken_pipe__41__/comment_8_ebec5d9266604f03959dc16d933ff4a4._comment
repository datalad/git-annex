I haven't been able to replicate this on two of my computers with the latest git-annex(as of this message).

It seemed to happen more on my Mac OS X Lion though. And nightlies haven't been build for some time.

So i'm waiting for a updated package for OS X. If you would rather clean up feel free to close this, I can just open it again if i hit it again.
