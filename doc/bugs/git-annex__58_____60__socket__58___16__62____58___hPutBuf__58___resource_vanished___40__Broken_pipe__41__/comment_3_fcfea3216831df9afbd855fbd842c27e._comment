I got a similar crash:

<pre>
fd:19: hGetLine: end of file
fd:18: hFlush: resource vanished (Broken pipe)
fd:18: hFlush: resource vanished (Broken pipe)
</pre>

I was able to determine that fd 18/19 is reliably used for one of the git cat-file processes on this system. It's quite likely that fd 16/17 would be similar. fd 27 less likely. (But could easily be some other less long running git command.)

This would be consistent with git cat-file crashing as it's trying to write to it and read from it. 

This took down the transferscanner thread, but the assistant continued running.
