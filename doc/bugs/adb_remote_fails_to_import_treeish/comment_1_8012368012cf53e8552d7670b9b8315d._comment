How unfortunate that Android on your phone does not support `find -printf`.
What version of Android is that? I've tested a few and they do support it.

Reverting [[!commit a32ff6cef03ceb695af7bc6415ae7eaac06d3443]] would
certainly avoid this problem. But that commit did solve a bug in supporting
large numbers of files.

Android's find is (probably) from toybox, and looking at its changelog, 
`find -printf` was added in May 2019, version 0.8.1. So versions of Android
before 2020 or so will probably have too old a version.

Maybe git-annex should have an option for older versions of android that
falls back to using `find -exec stat {} ;`. That would be a lot slower,
since it would run stat once per file, but it would work. Or it could
fall back to the old `find +` behavior that is limited to a certain number
of files. Or, it could consume the `find` output, segment it into groups of
files itself, and run `adb stat` on each group. Which would be somewhat
slower than using xargs, and potentially hard to get right.
