Ok, I've added an oldandroid=yes configuration to fix this. To enable it:

	git-annex enableremote android oldandroid=yes

(Replace "android" with whatever name you used for the adb remote.)

I don't much like this, but it's better than git-annex being slow with new
phones, and being slow with old phones is better than failing when there are
too many files to import. I did consider trying to auto-probe it from the
error message, but that seemed likely to be too fragile.
