### Please describe the problem.

Builds without Webapp and TestSuite fail at `Utility.AuthToken`.


### What steps will reproduce the problem?

Build git-annex with Webapp and TestSuite disabled.


### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?

Version 6.20170101 on arch linux.


### Please provide any additional information below.

We need to make `crypto-api` into a global dependency. Here is a [patch](https://gist.github.com/aroig/100c2977b6df8a2109823b715647d5fb).


### Have you had any luck using git-annex before? (Sometimes we get tired of reading bug reports all day and a lil' positive end note does wonders)

Oh yes! I use it everyday to sync collections of binary files across computers and VM's!
