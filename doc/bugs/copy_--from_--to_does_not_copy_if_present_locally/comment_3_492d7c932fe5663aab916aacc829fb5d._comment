That bug I fixed would also explain the behavior that you saw if the
content *was* present locally, and the location log *was* out of date about
that.

In that situation, git-annex sees that the object file is present, and so
treats the content as present, despite the location log not knowing it's
present. Which triggers the situation of the bug I fixed, causing it to
skip copying the file.

Also, there's a pretty easy way to get into this situation. When the file
is not present, run `git-annex --from --to`. Then interrupt it after it's
downloaded the file --from but before it's finished sending it --to.
This results in the file being present locally, but only transiently so it
didn't update the location log.

So my guess is you interrupted a copy like that (or it failed incomplete
for whatever reason).

Now that I've fixed that bug, the behavior in that situation is that it
does copy the file to the remote. And then it drops the local copy since
the location log doesn't contain it. So it resumes correctly now.
