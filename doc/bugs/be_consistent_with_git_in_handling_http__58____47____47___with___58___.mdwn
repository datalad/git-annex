### Please describe the problem.

I have not checked if it is legit to have an "empty" port number in the (http) URL but I see that `git` itself handles it fine, but git-annex is not happy:

```
❯ git clone https://datasets.datalad.org:/dbic/QA/.git/
Cloning into 'QA'...
warning: redirecting to https://datasets.datalad.org/dbic/QA/.git/

❯ git annex get sub-emmet/ses-20180508/anat/sub-emmet_ses-20180508_acq-MPRAGE_T1w.nii.gz

  Remote origin not usable by git-annex; setting annex-ignore

  https://datasets.datalad.org:/dbic/QA/.git//config download failed: Unsupported url scheme https://datasets.datalad.org:/dbic/QA/.git//config
get sub-emmet/ses-20180508/anat/sub-emmet_ses-20180508_acq-MPRAGE_T1w.nii.gz (from datasets.datalad.org...) 
(scanning for annexed files...)   
ok
(recording state in git...)
```

so it got the file only after enabling type=git special remote for the same location but with correct URL.

I think it would be nice if git-annex was as robust as git in such cases to avoid "late surprise".

Backstory: Happened to a user trying to access some NWB files on gin for DANDI project, here I used different/simpler/faster URL
