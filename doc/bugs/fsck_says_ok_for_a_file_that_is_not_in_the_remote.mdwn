### Please describe the problem.
fsck says ok while file is not present in the remote

The remote looks like this:
`apple-slicer	gcrypt::rsync://apple-slicer/encr/gits/important_docs`

```
> git annex fsck --from apple-slicer Taxes/2018-19/Joint_T5.pdf                       
fsck Taxes/2018-19/Joint_T5.pdf ok
(recording state in git...)
```

This portion in the log does not look good
