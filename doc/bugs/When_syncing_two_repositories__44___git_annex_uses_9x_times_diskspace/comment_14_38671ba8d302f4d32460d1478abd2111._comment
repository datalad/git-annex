Hi,

I promised you a feedback, once a newer version comes out.

I started fresh (from the gui), created a new directory, and copied my files over it, 
deleted the old one (git-annex-webapp just silently quite, when I tried to use the old directory).

Problems:
> 1. each starts costs me an hour at least

> 2. when computer starts git-annex starts too, and try to eat all the resources. 
   Resulting a 10 minute bootup. Would be nice to kick in, when computer idle, 
and others already finished booting up. (ie. I had a chance to start a webbrowser)

> 3. .git objects still going. 
find `pwd` >../gitannexstartup[TIME].txt

Some results:
gitannexstartup1034.txt
91179
gitannexstartup1035.txt
91566
gitannexstartup1040.txt
91938

    diff between 1034 and 1035 (only 1 minute difference when the file created), 
    shows many entries like this:
    /home/user/Desktop/down/annexnew/.git/objects/52/1ba05331f99585923f1724bb97c18a8f22837444843a45232
    /home/user/Desktop/down/annexnew/.git/objects/52/7457c478a19f8f85c73b9f17c5640378cf307044868a45258

So git objects keeps still adding. 
As I have many duplicates in my directory 
(backup of backups, I'm kind of paranoid, when comes to daily job), so it may be related to this bug:

http://git-annex.branchable.com/bugs/Direct_mode_keeps_re-checksuming_duplicated_files/

It is just a hunch. Please tell me what else to test.
