### Please describe the problem.

I have a repository that is encrypted using GPG. It is supposed to sync a folder between two laptops. (Note: this is a DIFFERENT repository than the one in my other bug report https://git-annex.branchable.com/bugs/Packfile_does_not_match_digest__58___gcrypt_with_assistant/ but the setup is the same)

I set everything up on laptop1. This time, I decided to wait for the syncing to finish, between laptop1 and laptop2 in order to prevent corruption. After laptop1 had finished syncing, I went to laptop2 and setup the repository.

- I created a local repository on laptop2.
- I told the webapp to combine repositories.

Then I got

"
Internal Server Error
Cannot find configuration for the gcrypt remote at ssh://denisa@vps.ip/backup/annex/denisa/Studium
"
