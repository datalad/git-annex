You need to provide more detail about "lock contention on `.git/config`".
Ideally an actual error message.

Normally it's perfectly fine to run multiple `git annex copy`, or any
other git-annex command for that matter.

And the only thing I know of that locks .git/config is when the
configuration is being changed, which doesn't normally happen when
copying to a remote, unless perhaps this remote has never been used before.
