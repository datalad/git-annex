I think that the problem is that keyid= can only be specified once,
so the last keyid= you specified was used, which was yours, and it ignored
the other one.

Try `git-annex enableremote origin keyid+=FCE2EDE78BD9B2CB`

I found some documentation that says that keyid= can be repeated multiple
times, and I think that documentation is wrong, and probably led you
astray. It's also possible that it used to work and was broken in some
option parsing changes, unsure. I'm working to correct the documentation now.

(Or, encryption=shared seems likely to avoid whatever the problem is.)
