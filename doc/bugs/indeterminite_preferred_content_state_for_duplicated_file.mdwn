Consider if file `foo` uses key K, and file `archive/bar` uses the same key K.
Using standard client preferred content settings, `git annex drop --auto`
will want to drop `archive/bar`, but `git annex get --auto` will want to get
`foo`. `git annex sync --content` will do both operations, getting and then
dropping the key. Running these commands repeatedly churns unncessarily.

Fixing this needs a map from key to files using it. Then, when checking
preferred content of `archive/bar`, it can see that `foo` also uses the
key. Since `foo` is wanted, it should not drop the key, even though
`archive/bar` is not wanted.

Such a map exists, in the keys database, but only in v6 mode repositories.
So, this seems solvable in v6 repositories, but not in v5.
Also, the associated files map may not be accurate at all times, so that's
a wrinkle to using it for this. --[[Joey]]
