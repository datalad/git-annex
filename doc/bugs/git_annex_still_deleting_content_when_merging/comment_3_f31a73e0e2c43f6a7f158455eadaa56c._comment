I was unsure as to what git-log command would best describe the problematic commits but in the meantime I did a:
    
     git log --graph --decorate=full --full-diff

These are the only three commits of that afternoon (the surrounding history is from completely different hours and very likely unrelated, so it wasn't posted)

It's a straight line (fast forward?), I don't see any merging either. Is this normal? Shouldn't a change in Repo A bring a merge in Repo B (where everything stayed the same) when things are synchronized? I don't fully understand how annex syncs happen so don't mind this question if it's all normal.
