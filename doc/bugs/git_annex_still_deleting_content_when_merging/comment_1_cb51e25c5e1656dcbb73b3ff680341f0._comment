Well, this is definitely a different bug or issue than the \"ugly bug\". In particular, it only affects a single file. Also, based on the commits, this may not be occuring in a merge commit at all (although I am not sure; I am not familiar with the log syntax shown).

AFAICS, the problem occurs on machine B. Which machine is the transcript from?

The \"Removing shared.skg\" is a good clue. This seems to be printed by `git`, in merge-recursive.c's `process_entry`. What is puzzling to me is that it's printed after the \"Automatic merge went well; stopped before committing as requested\", which  AFAICS is printed out by git last thing. Is this \"Removing\" message then printed out by another git command?

Enabling debug logging would probably help a lot, to narrow that down the next time this occurs.
