> I am not familiar with the log syntax shown

You mean the \"git log --stat\" part? Which git command would yield the most helpful syntax in this case?

> AFAICS, the problem occurs on machine B. Which machine is the transcript from?

Sorry I forgot to mention it: yes, it's from machine B.

> Is this \"Removing\" message then printed out by another git command?

Sorry I have no clue here. I didn't issue any git command from the terminal (nor did the user on computer A) if that was part of the question. It was all done in automatic.

> Enabling debug logging would probably help a lot, to narrow that down the next time this occurs.

Will do. I'll set 'annex.debug' to true in .git/config. Sadly, computer A is (a laptop) on vacation at the moment (well outside the local network), so I'll have to wait a couple of weeks to get back to debugging this. I'll have the logs with debug enabled when it happens again.

Thanks again for your support and for developing git-annex.
