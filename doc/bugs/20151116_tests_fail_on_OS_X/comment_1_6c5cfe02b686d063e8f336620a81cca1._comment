You may have omitted 1 of the 2 failures in your paste.

The only one I see has something to do with a filename being too long.
Since the filename in question is 77 bytes long, or 178 with the full path,
and industry standard for filename size is 1024 or longer, I am at a loss
why that would be considered too long.

AFAIK there have been no changes in git-annex's filenames recently. What
was the previous version that worked?
