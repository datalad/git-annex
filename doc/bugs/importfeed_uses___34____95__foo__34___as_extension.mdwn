### Please describe the problem.
When running importfeed on gitminutes <http://feeds.gitminutes.com/gitminutes-podcast> git-annex interprets the extension as "_mp3" rather than ".mp3" which means that renaming is needed for various audio players to accept the files.

git annex importfeed http://feeds.gitminutes.com/gitminutes-podcast --fast
