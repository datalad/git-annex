This would need to start with `git-annex import --from=remote` 
getting a `--message` option. Which I've just implemented.

As for adding an option to `git-annex pull`, it would need to be an option
other than `--message`, because `git-annex sync` already uses `--message`
for the commit message. And since `git-annex pull` can pull from more than
one remote at a time, it seems that it would need an option that specifies
a message plus which remote to use that message for. Or the option
would need to only be used when using `git-annex pull` with a single
specified remote.

That seems like perhaps unncessary complexity, since if you want to import
a tree from a remote and specify a message, you can just use 
`git-annex import` with `--message` now. 
And then you can run `git-annex pull` to proceed with the rest of what it does.

Good enough?
