Added a 60 second sleep right after the assistant checks isPointerFile,
then started the assistant and ran:

	touch new
	sleep 10
	echo '/annex/objects/SHA256E-s30--93c16dbf65b7b66e479bd484398c09c920338e4a1df1fe352b245078d04645f4' > new

574def is the sha256sum of the annex link that I wrote to the file. So this
does replicate the bug. Although it's odd that it then put back the annex
link in the subsequent commit.
