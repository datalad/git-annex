any ideas?  now I got to another box where I have tried to \"sync\" this repo using assistant and found that it didn't sync anything since Apr 17th but also git history is quite a show
: [tig view of history](http://www.oneukrainian.com/tmp/git-annex-blowup.png)

with bunch of commits moving files from annex into git etc.  Need to kill assistant for now. System has `10.20240129-1~ndall+1`
