I've fixed this race in the assistant.

Question now is, can this bug be closed, or does it need to be left open,
and git-annex made to recover from this situation? Given the complexity
of making git-annex notice this, I'm sort of inclined to not have it
auto-recover. Manual recovery seems pretty simple, just delete the file and
re-add it with the right key. 

Thoughts?
