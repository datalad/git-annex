When on an adjusted branch, `git annex sync` will sync the submodule
commit for the initial addition of a submodule, but it doesn't seem to
sync changes in the recorded commit.  Here's a demo of the issue based
off of Michael's script at [DataLad's issue 4292][0].

[[!format sh """
cd "$(mktemp -d --tmpdir gx-sync-demo-XXXXXXX)"

git init
git annex init
git commit --allow-empty -mc0
git annex adjust --unlock

git init sub
git -C sub commit --allow-empty -mc0
git submodule add ./sub
git commit -m'add sub'
# A new submodule is sync'd.
git annex sync --no-commit --no-push --no-pull --no-content

git -C sub commit --allow-empty -mc1
git add sub
git commit -m'sub update'

# A change in the submodule ID is not.
git annex sync --no-commit --no-push --no-pull --no-content
git diff master..
"""]]

With a git-annex built from 8.20200309-62-gc8fec6ab0, the submodule
remains modified between `master` and `adjusted/master(unlocked))`.

```
diff --git a/sub b/sub

```

I was able to resolve the issue (i.e. the above demo outputs an empty
diff) with the patch below, though that might of course be the
completely wrong way to fix this.

Thanks in advance for looking into this issue.

Subject: [PATCH] adjust: Propagate submodule changes back to original branch

When the recorded submodule commit changes on an adjusted branch, the
change is carried in the function that reverseAdjustedCommit passes
for adjustTree's adjusttreeitem parameter.  Update the CommitObject
handling in adjustTree to consider adjusttreeitem so that a submodule
change is synced back.
