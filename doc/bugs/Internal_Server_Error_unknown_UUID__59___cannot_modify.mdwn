### Please describe the problem.
I was trying to use "Local Computer" option to sync up two machines on my local network. I was having some firewall issues and it failed on one machine.
It still created a repository without a name in the web ui and i get that Error unknown UUID when trying to edit or delete it.

### What steps will reproduce the problem?
Machine A initiates pairing. Machine B accepts pairing. Machine A has a firewall blocking outgoing connections.
Machine B times out. Machine A accepts outgoing connections for vnetd. Machine A starts syncing with Machine B.
Machine B gets files but have a broken web ui.
