It's not repository OR key, dead can be used with multiple keys, multiple
repositories, or a combination of keys and repositories.

(The automatically generated --help does not make it clear that --key
can be used repeatedly, but the man page does and is correct. I guess that
optparse-applicative --help does not try to distinguish between options
that can be repeated vs options where a later option overrides an earlier
one.)
