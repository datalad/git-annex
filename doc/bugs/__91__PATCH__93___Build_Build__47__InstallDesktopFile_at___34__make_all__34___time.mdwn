	    Build Build/InstallDesktopFile at "make all" time
	    
	    If you run stack as root (e.g. for "make install"), any files it
	    creates under ./ will, of course, be owned by root.  That's a
	    problem for subsequent runs as non-root.
	    
	    Reduce the likelihood of that happening by building
	    Build/InstallDesktopFile during "make all", so that it needn't be
	    built by "make install".
