Dropping a single unlocked file and then running git
status with `GIT_TRACE=1` replicates the additional smudge every time.

The index before and after git status smudging have identical content, so
git-annex seems to have updated it correctly already. It seems that the
mtime of the index file is causing git to do that one additional smudge.

Eg, the file git-annex dropped had a mtime of 13:02:43.716964483. The
~/index file that git-annex generated has a mtime of 13:02:43.752964130
which is newer, but only by a fraction of a second. So, git probably
assumes the mtimes are sufficiently close that it can't trust that the
index file really reflects the current content of the work tree file. And
so it re-smudges the work tree file unncessarily.

I have not been able to find a number of files to drop that replicates
the bug report. When a lot of files are dropped, it starts taking
sufficiently long to update the index file that it ends up with a newer
timestamp, which avoids the unnecessary additional smudging. The worse
case I have found here is dropping 9 files causes all 9 to get re-smudged,
but that's not enough to get git to use the progress display.
