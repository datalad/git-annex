You seem to be talking about using https to access a git repository.

git-annex is not generally able to use https as a transport -- ie, it
can maybe download files from a git repository over https, if
the repository is set up just right. But it can't upload file to that
repository, nor can it promptly notice when changes are synced to that
repository from elsewhere.

So, there's not much that the assistant can do with such a repository.

You'll be better off using ssh for your git-annex repositories.
