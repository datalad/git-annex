This was supposed to be dealt with in version 6.20161027. But, I see now
that the parser I thought was triggering on those missing object lines,
was not really (`extractSha` does not match in this case because of the
colon after the sha). 

Instead, the problem seems to be that `git fsck` is exiting nonzero. So it
assumes that fsck is failing without printing out any shas, which is a
condition that calls for repairs.

About all I can think to do is, if fsck outputs "duplicateEntries" and
no other lines at all, and exits nonzero, treat this as a success.
This risks ignoring other reasons fsck might exit nonzero, but hopefully
it would output something else in such a case. I've implemented this.

---

I am interested in getting at the root cause of the problem of
duplicate directory entries. It seems pretty likely to result from using
adjusted branches.

It would be useful to get more information about the trees that fsck
is warning about; are they part of existing or past adjusted branches
or not? Are they merge commits?

Leaving this bug open since we really need to get at the root cause of
the problem.
