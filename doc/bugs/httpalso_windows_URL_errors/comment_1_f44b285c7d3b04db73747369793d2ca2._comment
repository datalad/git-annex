That was a good analysis, thanks!

I see that Remote.HttpAlso.supportedLayouts uses hashDirLower and
hashDirMixed. Which are implemented using OS-native path separators.
So, on Windows, that does come out with the slash the wrong way around.
I don't think that the actual url-encoding of it is problimatic.

I've put in a workaround. I have not tested on windows, so please re-open
this bug report if you upgrade and find it still somehow doesn't work.
