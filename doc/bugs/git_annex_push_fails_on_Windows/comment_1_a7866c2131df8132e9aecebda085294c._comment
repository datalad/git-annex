If I put the same file in the remote under the name pull-test.xtx and invoke the command git annex pull push-win-remote, git annex outputs:

list push-win-remote ok

import push-win-remote pull-test.xtx

ok

update refs/remotes/push-win-remote/adjusted/main(unlocked) ok

(recording state in git...)

But the file is not present in the repository.
