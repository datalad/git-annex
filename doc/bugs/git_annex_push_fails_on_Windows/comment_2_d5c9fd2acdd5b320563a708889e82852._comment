The same behavior can be observed on linux. I just ran `git annex adjust
--unlock` after committing to get into the same state as on Windows.

It's actually not supported to set annex-tracking-branch to an adjusted
branch. Instead, you ought to set:

	git config remote.push-win-remote.annex-tracking-branch main

When pulling a new file, as in comment #1, that results in the change
getting merged into main, and then the adjusted branch is automatically
updated as well.

When pushing a newly added file, I first had to run 
`git-annex adjust --unlock` in order to update main. That was a 
bug in `git-annex push`; it ought to update main for you in this case;
it already does when pushing to a regular git remote. Fixed that.

The "Not updating export to push-win-remote because adjusted/main(unlocked)
does not exist" message is misleading. I've improved that to be 
"Not updating export to push-win-remote because tracking branch name is not valid"
which at least hints in the right direction.
