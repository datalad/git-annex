Hmm, I've never considered combining --quiet with --json. It's kind of
undefined and really not clear to me what it should do.

But, --json-error-messages makes the json contain an error-messages field,
and the error message is in there. So you can just extract that and ignore
the other messages in the json output. No need to use --quiet then.

I suppose there may be someone who uses --json as a matter of course, but
adds --quiet to that when they want to disable the json output. So
changing the current behavior, ill-defined as it is, would be asking for
trouble.

What actually happens currently is which ever output option comes last
overrides earlier options. So `--json --quiet` is quiet, and `--quiet
--json` outputs json. `--json-error-messages` is like `--json` in this
regard to. Which is just behavior that fell out of the option parser
implementation.
