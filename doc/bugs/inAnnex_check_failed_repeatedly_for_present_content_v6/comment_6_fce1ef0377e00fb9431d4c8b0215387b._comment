Removing the db and running `fsck` seems to have fixed the problem. I really appreciate it. I do think that I unlocked and then re-locked some of the affected files, but I think only after I noticed that they were behaving strangely---in particular, I think I only did this with the affected files that were not `fsck`ing correctly (and this was before I realized they were not `fsck`ing correctly), not with e.g. the Car Seat Headrest song.

I didn't get the chance to fill in the \"Have you had any luck using git-annex before\" part of the standard bug report, so I thought I should add that here: Yes, I've used git-annex regularly for quite a while now. It's an inspiring piece of open-source software. I'm always finding new things it can do. Thank you for creating it, and thanks for your help with this issue!
