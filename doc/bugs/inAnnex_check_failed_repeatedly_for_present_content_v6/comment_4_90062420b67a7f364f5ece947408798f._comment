Right, just back up the keys/db just in case, and you need to fsck at least
any files that are not locked (to repopulate the keys/db for those), 
so safest is to fsck the whole repository..

Is it possible that you've run `git annex unlock` / `git annex lock` on
some of the affected files in the past?
