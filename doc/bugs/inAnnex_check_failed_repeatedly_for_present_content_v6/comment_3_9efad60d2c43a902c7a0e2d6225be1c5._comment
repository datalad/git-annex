The second file (`01 Fill in the Blank.m4a`) does still exist, although `annex get` always re-retrieves it. annx.thin is not set. Here's the git config, minus remotes:

    [core]
        repositoryformatversion = 0
        filemode = true
        bare = false
        logallrefupdates = true
    [annex]
        uuid = e9731ab7-6a76-4eef-b337-2b8573380014
        version = 6
    [filter \"annex\"]
        smudge = git-annex smudge %f
        clean = git-annex smudge --clean %f

Thanks for the fix. Just to make sure I understand before breaking anything futher, the idea would be to move `.git/annex/keys/db` somewhere safe, `git annex lock` all the affected files, and then `git annex fsck` the whole repository? or just the affected files?
