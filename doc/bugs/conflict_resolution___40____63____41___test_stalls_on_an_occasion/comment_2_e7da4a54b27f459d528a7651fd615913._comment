I wondered if running the add and init tests once per worker was causing
a diminishing returns at higher -J levels. Since at -J16, each worker runs
the add and init tests followed by only 2 or 3 other tests, the time spent
on the add and init tests becomes more and more significant.

Timings from my laptop (with 4 cores):

	-J16    250 seconds
	-J8     212 seconds
	-J4     214 seconds
        -J2     307 seconds

So a small diminishing returns at -J16.

After some improvements:

	-J16    223 seconds
	-J8     218 seconds
	-J4     214 seconds

That won't solve smaug being so overloaded though.
If anything, it will just make it get to some other test before it times out..
