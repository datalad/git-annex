I notice that just the init test is taking 346 seconds to run. Then the add
test is taking 499 seconds. Those are both tests that do very little work,
and here run in 1s or so. The only thing "wrong" with the conflict resolution tests
may be that they do 10x as much work.

In the same log, the quickcheck tests, which are entirely CPU bound, ran at normal
speed. So probably it's disk IO slowing the other tests down.

Also, `result-smaug-900/handle-result.yaml-437-402e214e-success/result-smaug-900/git-annex.log`
times out on another test. So I'm sure the problem is not a specific test stalling.

And in `result-smaug-899/handle-result.yaml-435-3e89687a-success/result-smaug-899/git-annex.log`,
it succeeds in 856 seconds. That still seems slow, my laptop can run it in 250 seconds
with 4 cores (even when using -J16). That makes me think that the IO load (or whatever)
on smaug is varying and slowing down the test by different amounts.

Smaug has 16 cores. The test suite automatically parallelizes, so there
will be 16 worker processes. But each worker process has to itself 
run the init and add tests, which are prereqs for most other tests. So those
tests are being run 16 times. Which just by itself, at the 346 and 499 second
run times, will take more than an hour. Also if disk IO is starved, a lot
of workers is only going to thrash it more.

So `git-annex test -J1` or so seems like a good idea.

It might also be better to not have a single timeout for the whole
test suite, but time out if it stalls for long enough without generating new
output.
