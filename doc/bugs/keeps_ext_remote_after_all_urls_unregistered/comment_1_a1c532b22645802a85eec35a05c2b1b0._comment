Removing the last url from the web special remote makes it treat
content as no longer present in that remote. That is a documented special
case.

For all other special remotes, git-anenx does not have any reason
to expect that removing a record of an url will mean that the special
remote will not be able to still retrieve content that was stored on it.

reregisterurl is no different than unregisterurl in this respect. Both document
this special case. You've filed multiple bugs about rmurl having the same
behavior in the past, IIRC. And IIRC those all got closed, so I guess I'll
close this one too.
