Well, it then seem to me that \"web\" special remote is not that special and it would be useful to extend its *special case* to be supported by other special remotes exhibiting similar behavior of being useless if no URLs are registered for a key.

BTW, isn't it not just `web` but also `bittorrent` (do not have any URL handy to check ATM) since I expect it also to be a special remote needing to know a URL?

Anyways, sorry for the noise, but as it happens with *special cases* and aging brains, I keep forgetting some of them.  Hopefully I will make a better mental note about this one ;-)
