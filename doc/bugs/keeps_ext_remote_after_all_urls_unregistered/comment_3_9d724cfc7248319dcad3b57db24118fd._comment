It would need some way for a special remote to indicate to git-annex that
it is in this unusual class of remotes where not having an url is the same as
content no longer being present in it.

Implementing that would just make some more remotes have a special case,
which seems even harder to remember. I'd rather remove the special case,
but of course that will break existing workflows.

And it is unusual. Consider a S3 remote. It can have an url recorded for a
object stored in it, but forgetting the url doesn't mean that the S3 bucket
no longer contains the file. If git-annex behaved this way for S3, it would
be broken in a way that could be expensive to the user.

(The special case is not currently implemented for bittorrent special
remote. But it also doesn't record urls in a user-visible way actually.)
