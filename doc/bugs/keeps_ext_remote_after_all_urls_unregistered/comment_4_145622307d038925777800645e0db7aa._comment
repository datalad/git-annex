**yes**: remote would need to *indicate to git-annex* that \"feature\". ATM git-annex already does that via `EXTENSIONS` to announce what it can do, and it seems that 

> The special remote can respond to that with its own EXTENSIONS message

so it could have announced 


```
EXTENSIONS ABSENTIFNOURL
```

or alike.

**yes** -- it is \"unusual\" as not every special remote would be \"URL-only\" remote. But there is AFAIK a growing number of custom remotes which are like that at least in `datalad` land: `datalad`, `datalad-archives`, [`datalad-uncurl`](https://docs.datalad.org/projects/next/en/latest/generated/datalad_next.annexremotes.uncurl.html) and likely others. Typically they are \"read-only\" remotes, and URL is used as the identifier for custom \"downloader\" support.

It is interesting that bittorrent remote doesn't make them visible... never used, but wondered how my life would have been if I wanted to manage collection of torrent urls per each key...
