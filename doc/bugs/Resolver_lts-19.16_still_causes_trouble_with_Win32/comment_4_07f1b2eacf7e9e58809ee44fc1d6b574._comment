@joey: No problem. Most of my git-annex use is rather vanilla (apart from annexing huge files) so I
don't usually need the very latest in git-annex so I can always fall back to an earlier release/build.
It's just that I like to keep track of git-annex's development and make sure it works on Windows most
of the time which means I feel a need to build fresh versions and then kind of dogfood them as soon
as possible. As a non-developer being able to report build errors and other bugs is my way of taking
part in this project and hopefully in the process help make things smoother for the Windows user constituent
that I represent.

PS. Ikiwiki broke that link you made to my related todo. What's with that? The backlink appears in the todo,
however.
