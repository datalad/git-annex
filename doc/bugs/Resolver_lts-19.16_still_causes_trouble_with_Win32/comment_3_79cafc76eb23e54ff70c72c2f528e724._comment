Hey, thanks and sorry for inflicting that stack change on you a second
time. I hypothesized that the toolchain installation, that failed before,
might have been a transient problem, and it seems it was, but now these other
problems surface..

Surprisingly, putting Win32 in the stack file does not break stack build
on linux. But I don't like putting it in there regardless, and needing
to downgrade the other dependencies for it is also suboptimal.

I'll revert the stack.yaml change again, and it seems we'll need to wait for
[[todo/windows__58___prepare_for_Win32_not_export_c__95___entities]]
to be fixed before updating it.
