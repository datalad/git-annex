### Please describe the problem.
git-annex's dependencies fail to install unless fingertree is constrained to < 0.1.2.0

Note this has already been fixed upstream in reducers https://github.com/ekmett/reducers/commit/f18a111d66c343bd472f914baaa948191f8ecf55

However, there hasn't been a new release yet of reducers so it still affects git-annex currently.

### What steps will reproduce the problem?
cabal install --jobs=8 --max-backjumps=100000 --only-dependencies --flags=s3\ webapp


### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?
6.20171003 on macOS

### Please provide any additional information below.

The error is
[[!format sh """

### Have you had any luck using git-annex before? (Sometimes we get tired of reading bug reports all day and a lil' positive end note does wonders)

Yes :)
