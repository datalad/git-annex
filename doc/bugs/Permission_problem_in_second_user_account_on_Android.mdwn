I get the following error message upon starting git-annex in a second user account on Android:

    Falling back to hardcoded app location: cannot find expected files in /data/app-lib
    git annex webapp
    lib/lib.runshell.so: line 133: git: Permission denied

    [Terminal session finished]

The same version of git-annex works just fine for the primary user.
(The primary user has root access which unfortunately can't be enabled for other user accounts.)

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?

  * git-annex: 5.20140710
  * OS: CyanogenMod 10.1.3-p3110
