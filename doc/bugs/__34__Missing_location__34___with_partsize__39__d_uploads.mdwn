### Please describe the problem.

On my Garage/S3 remote, if I configure `partsize=100Mib`, any uploads which are larger than this partsize return:

```
copy testlargefile (to garage...)

  XmlException {xmlErrorMessage = "Missing Location"}


  XmlException {xmlErrorMessage = "Missing Location"}
failed
```

The file here is at 124MiB - I can then immediately reattempt the copy command and get:

```
copy testlargefile ok
```

Any files below 100MiB report no errors and if I configure no partsize - there are no errors either.

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?

master on Fedora Silverblue.

### Have you had any luck using git-annex before? (Sometimes we get tired of reading bug reports all day and a lil' positive end note does wonders)

All wonderful otherwise.
