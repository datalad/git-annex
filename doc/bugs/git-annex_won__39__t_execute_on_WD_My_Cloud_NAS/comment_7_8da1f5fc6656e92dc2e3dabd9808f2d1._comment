As an aside, just tried syncthing's arm verion, and I get a \"runtime: kernel page size (32768) is larger than runtime page size (4096)\" error. While their arm64 version also won't run.  

Perhaps it's a similar issue with git-annex? Seems the page-size comes up in a number of contexts of people trying to get software running on the WD NAS.

Is there any way to adjust  this page-size in the linker?

Thanks
