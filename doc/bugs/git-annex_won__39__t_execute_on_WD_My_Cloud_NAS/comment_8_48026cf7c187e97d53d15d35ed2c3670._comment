The arm daily build now uses a 32kb page size. So try
<https://downloads.kitenet.net/git-annex/autobuild/armel/git-annex-standalone-armel.tar.gz>

That has been verified to fix the problem on a Drobo 5N.

This may still not be enough for some of the affected NAS devices, which
use a 64kb page size. Unfortunately, gold fails to link with a 64kb page
size: <http://bugs.debian.org/844467>
