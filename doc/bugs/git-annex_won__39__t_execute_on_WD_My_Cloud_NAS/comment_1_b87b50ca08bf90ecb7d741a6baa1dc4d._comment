I wonder if this ELF issue extends to other binaries included in the
git-annex bundle, or does it only affect the git-annex (and
git-annex-shell) binary?

It looks like git is working when used inside runshell, and that is using a
git binary from the git-annex bundle.

If so, it could have something to do with how the haskell binary is being
linked. I found this thread about fixing this problem in the gold linker:
<https://sourceware.org/ml/binutils/2012-08/msg00486.html>. IIRC
the arm build is currently using the bfd linker, not gold.
