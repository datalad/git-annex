I think I have been hit by this bug as well with getting \"fatal: stash failed\" after importing some files and trying to sync.

Indeed, temporarily deactivating filter.annex.process and filter.annex.clean allowed to sync. 

And the problem didn't reappear after so far. 
Is there a reliable workaround (the bug report seem to have no responses?). 

git version 2.43.0
git-annex version: 10.20230926-g4ac2758ba589562e427a66437b9fdcd5172357e1
