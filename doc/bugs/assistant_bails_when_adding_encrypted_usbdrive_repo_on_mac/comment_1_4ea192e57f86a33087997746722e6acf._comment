Can you take a look at ~/annex/.git/config and if there is an entry for this git remote, post it? (Or post the whole thing if unsure..)

Also, can you get gpg to list your secret keys, and see if key 71BFBC31 is in the list? You can do so by running `gpg --list-secret-keys` ; if you don't have gpg in your path at the terminal, you can use the version from the git-annex DMG by first running `/Volumes/git-annex/git-annex.app/Contents/MacOS/runshell`
