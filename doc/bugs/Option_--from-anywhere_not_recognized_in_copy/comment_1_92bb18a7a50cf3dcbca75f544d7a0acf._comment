Your git-annex version is from before --from-anywhere was implemented.

Also, `--from-anywhere` needs `--to=remote`, as documented on the man page.
"here" is not a remote name, so `--from-anywhere --to=here` will not work.

	git-annex copy --from-anywhere --to=here
	git-annex: there is no available git remote named "here"

A simpler way to do what you were trying to do, that does work is
`git-annex copy --to=here`

An even simpler way to do exactly the same thing is `git-annex get`

So, I don't see any point in trying to support `--from-anywhere --to=here`
with `git-annex copy`.
