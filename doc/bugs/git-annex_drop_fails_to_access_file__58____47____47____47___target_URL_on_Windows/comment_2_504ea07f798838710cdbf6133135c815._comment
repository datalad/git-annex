I can't reproduce that behavior on linux. 

	joey@darkstar:~/tmp/xx>git annex addurl  --file=annexed file:///./data
	addurl annexed (downloading file:///./data ...) 
	curl: (37) Couldn't open file /data

Here, curl seems to be doing the right thing; the url is not relative; it's 
for `/./data`, which doesn't exist.

Relative `file:` urls shouldn't be valid at all, I think?

---

For checking if a file: url exits, git-annex parses the url and stats
the file itself. The first screenshot
shows this check for file: url existance failing on Windows for 
the url `file:///C:/tmp/test/test.dat`

I guess this might come down to problems with parsing file: urls on
Windows; seems especially complicated by drive letters. git-annex and curl
seem to parse this url in different ways.

Checking how that url parses, the uriScheme is "file:" and the uriPath is
"/C:/tmp/test/test.dat". So, it seems clear why it fails to stat that file.

Is there actually a valid way to produce a file: url that refers to a drive
letter? curl seems to think so, since it found the file when `git annex
addurl` ran it. I don't know if the above parse is valid, but it's not
git-annex's code doing the parse, but the URI parsing library.
