It does occur to me that one "solution" might be to have flushDbQueue
not rethrow the exception, and just re-enqueue the write. Then, if a write
fails in the middle of a long git-annex command, it will just queue up
sqlite changes until later. And hopefully whatever is preventing writing to
the database at that time would later resolve itself. At shutdown, it would
need to make sure to flush the remaining queue and not ignore a write
failure then.

That has the potential problem that, if the write keeps failing, it might
end up buffering a large number of writes in memory, and since the queue
would be full, it would be trying to write every time. So it would both use
an ever-growing amount of memory, and be slowed down by the write attempts.

Still, it does give it something better to do while the write is failing
than sleeping and retrying, eg to do the rest of the work it's been asked
to do.

(Update: Reads from a database first call flushDbQueue, and it would
not be safe for that to return without actually writing to the database,
since the read would then see possible stale information. It turns
out that `git-annex get` does do a database read per file (getAssociatedFiles).
So it seems this approach will not work.)
