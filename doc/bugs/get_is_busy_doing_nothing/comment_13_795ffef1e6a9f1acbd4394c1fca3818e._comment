I tried modifying git-annex to throw ErrorBusy whenever it wrote to the
sqlite database, to see how much of the behavior that could reproduce.

That led to 10 second delays due to retrying, and the "failed to commit
changes to sqlite database: Just SQLite3 returned ErrorBusy" message.

But, it did not cause the "thread blocked indefinitely in an MVar
operation". Which makes me wonder if that is caused by sqlite use
elsewhere, perhaps in a read operation rather than a write.

I did try making reads throw ErrorBusy, and it didn't reproduce the MVar
problem either, instead "sqlite query crashed: SQLite3 returned ErrorBusy".
