@Atemu, that seems like at least a plausible theory, that disk write
pressure (eg from getting annex objects) is causing sqlite writes to take a
long time. Increasing the wait time from the current 10 seconds would make
sense if that's what's happening.

The somewhat weird thing is that, with a single git-annex process, no
matter the number of jobs, it only has a single database handle open,
and so it should not be possible for one write to still be happening when
a second write happens. Unless, of course, sqlite is doing something behind
my back, like finishing the write in a separate thread? Or, of course,
there might be a second process that has somehow not been visible..

So, I've added some debugging of when it commits to the database. 
@yarik, please get an updated build with commit
5da1a785086910c32559a46f9110779d765af0cd,
and try after setting:

	git config annex.debug true
	git config annex.debugfilter Database.Handle

This should tell us if there are somehow multiple writers at the same time,
and also will tell us the timing of how long it is taking to commit to the
db.
