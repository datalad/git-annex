Concurrent writes to sqlite (in WAL mode) can fail, 
but git-annex deals with that by retrying 100 times (once every 0.1 seconds).
So apparently other writes kept making it fail, or the database is somehow
stuck locked.

I think that the MVar blocking happens as a consequence of the sqlite
write failing and is not worth investigating separately, probably.

What filesystem is this happening on?
