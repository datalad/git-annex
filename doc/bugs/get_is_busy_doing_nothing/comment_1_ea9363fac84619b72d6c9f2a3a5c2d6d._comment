git-annex has stall detection, but it's not enabled by default, because how
slow a "stall" is can vary quite a bit. Setting annex.stalldetection would
probably help.

Plenty of http clients can stall out if there's a network problem. For
example, wget that and pull the ethernet cable; you'll see wget hang for at
least as long as it took me to write this comment. Since it's just waiting
for a read, it will block until the TCP connection closes, and situations can
cause dead TCP connections to not close for a long time.
