I've made it retry as long as necessary on ErrorBusy, while also noticing
when another process is suspended and has the sqlite database locked,
and avoiding retrying forever in that situation.

This seems to be as far as I can take this bug report, I don't know
100% for sure if I've fixed it, but git-annex's behavior should certainly
be improved.
