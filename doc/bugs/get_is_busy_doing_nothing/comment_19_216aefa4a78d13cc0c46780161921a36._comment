So in flushDbQueue, which is waiting for all queued writes to complete.
When the write failed with an exception, a previous flushDbQueue
would have left the queue's MVar empty.

So, now I understand how the original problem can lead to this MVar
problem. And I've fixed that part of it. Now a write failing this way will
refill the queue with what it failed to write. So it will try to write it
again later.

This flushDbQueue probably also explains the hang at
"recording state in git" since there is also a final flushDbQueue at that
point, and I guess it fails to detect a deadlock at that point so just
hangs forever. So my fix should also avoid that.

None of which means this is fixed, really, just the fallout from the
write timeout problem will be less severe now.
