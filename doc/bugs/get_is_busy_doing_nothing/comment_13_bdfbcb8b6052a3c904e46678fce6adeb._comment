To hopefully find out what MVar operation is blocking, I have added lock
debugging instrumentation to all database calls. This will need a special
build of git-annex with the DebugLocks build flag enabled. 

I have made a standalone tarball built that way available here:
<https://downloads.kitenet.net/git-annex/linux/debuglocks/>

It should display a backtrace on stderr when the MVar deadlock happens.
