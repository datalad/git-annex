I've avoided the excessive sqlite database writes. Which doubled the speed
of git-annex in some circumstances, wow!

@yoh see if it still happens once you upgrade to a git-annex
with [[!commit 6fbd337e34cd62881ed5e21616e9c00d7bf35378]].

It would be possible for git-annex to do its own locking around writes
to the sqlite database. That would surely avoid any problem that sqlite might
have that would cause ErrorBusy. I want to think some about 
[[todo/withExclusiveLock_blocking_issue]] first.
