It seems that sqlite on BTRFS is somewhat problimatic performance-wise. 
See this blog post from Colin Walters where firefox was periodically
freezing due to sqlite, and apparently the database file was highly fragmented.

Mounting with nodatacow or autodefrag may help, or 
`chattr +C .git/annex/keysdb/db`

Possibly being slow could explain the ErrorBusy: If there are somehow
two processes writing to the database and one is being slow, then
the other one could get ErrorBusy repeatedly for the 10 seconds it takes
git-annex to give up.
