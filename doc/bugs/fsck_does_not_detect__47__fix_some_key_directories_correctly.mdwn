### Please describe the problem.

ATM I am chasing a problem that somehow one key "mutated" although I do not remember doing anything malicious, file seems to be also not  writable (itself).
So I decided to fsck, and only spotted a problem when some warnings started to appear that I am not the owner of the (key)file.  So I looked inside and found
that all key dirs are writeable BUT annex complains only about the ones where it can't change permissions since they don't belong to me

~~btw -- the same wrong permissions on the upper hash directories, and they do not get fixed/complained about at all (that is ok)~~
