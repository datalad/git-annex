### Please describe the problem.

We used a script calling out to `reregisterurl` to move URLs from datalad to regular web remote: [https://github.com/dandi/dandisets/pull/387/files](https://github.com/dandi/dandisets/pull/387/files).

Even after removing all urls, key is associated with the remote, and thus `annex find`able:

```shell
dandi@drogon:/mnt/backup/dandi/dandisets/000897$ git annex whereis sub-amadeus/sub-amadeus_ses-08152019_behavior+ecephys.nwb
whereis sub-amadeus/sub-amadeus_ses-08152019_behavior+ecephys.nwb (2 copies) 
  	00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001 -- web
   	cf13d535-b47c-5df6-8590-0793cb08a90a -- datalad

  web: https://api.dandiarchive.org/api/assets/d3a96834-ee80-4afa-b985-82066817272c/download/

ok

```

I think that git-annex should have completely dissociated that remote from the key whenever the very last url was reregistered.


### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?
