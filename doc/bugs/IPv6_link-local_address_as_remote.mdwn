### Please describe the problem.

Unable to use IPv6 link-local address as ssh remote.

### What steps will reproduce the problem?

```
git clone [fe80::aaaa:aaaa:aaaa:aaaa%enp4s0f2]:/path/to/repo.git repo
cd repo
git annex pull

  Remote origin cannot currently be accessed.
```

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?

10.20241202-1~bpo12+1 on Debian backports amd64

### Please provide any additional information below.

There is no problem with global IPv6 addresses, so it is likely that the percent suffix "%ethernetdevice" is causing the problem.  Note that git (`git clone` in the example above) works fine with the link-local IPv6 address.

### Have you had any luck using git-annex before? (Sometimes we get tired of reading bug reports all day and a lil' positive end note does wonders)

Yes, I have successfully used git-annex with a local remote (same computer), ssh over IPv4, and ssh to a globally visible IPv6 address.
