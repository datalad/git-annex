Reproduced this, and found the filename it's using with strace:

	joey@darkstar:~/tmp/annex>touch '/home/joey/mnt/Music/KIRA/KIRA - The Introduction (Deluxe Edition)/KIRA - The Introduction (Deluxe Edition) - 05 Games (feat566f1-3-1a21815. '
	touch: cannot touch '/home/joey/mnt/Music/KIRA/KIRA - The Introduction (Deluxe Edition)/KIRA - The Introduction (Deluxe Edition) - 05 Games (feat566f1-3-1a21815. ': Invalid argument

The problem is the trailing space in the filename, which VFAT does not support:

	joey@darkstar:~/tmp/annex>touch '/home/joey/mnt/Music/KIRA/foo '
	touch: cannot touch '/home/joey/mnt/Music/KIRA/foo ': Invalid argument

There was already a similar workaround for of not allowing a filename to
end with ".", so I made it also check for whitespace.
