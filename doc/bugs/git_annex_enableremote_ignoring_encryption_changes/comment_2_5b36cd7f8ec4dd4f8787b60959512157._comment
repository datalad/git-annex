Huh, so it seems that for gcrypt remotes, enableremote just doesn't
call their setup function at all!

Ah, it's because it sees the remote has an url, so it is not treated
as a special remote, but as a regular git remote, and so the
special remote encryption changes are ignored. (Since 6.20160527)

So, enableremote needs to fail when it thinks it's enabling a regular git
remote and has been passed some parameters which cannot apply to such a
remote. Done.

And, enableremote needs fixed to treat existing gcrypt remotes as special
remotes. Done.

Also, gcrypt special remotes didn't actually support being re-enabled
either. I made that work. When an encryption key is added, that
automatically makes it change the gcrypt-participants, too.

I suppose enableremote could even be made to do the `GCRYPT_FULL_REPACK`
and forced push, but that seems like too much for it to do!
