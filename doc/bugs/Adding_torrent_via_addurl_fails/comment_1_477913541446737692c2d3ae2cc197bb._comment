announce-list comes from BEP-0012. Reading that spec, the torrent file is
supposed to still have the announce field, although its contents are 
supposed to be ignored by clients that support announce-list.

When I download that torrent, it doesn't seem to have an
announce-list either. No announce and no announce-list? It's possible that
aria2c, which I used to download it like git-annex does, doesn't know about
announce-list and left it out when saving the torrent file. Maybe it left
out announce too? Do you have a non-magnet url for this torrent file?

I'll make the haskell torrent library support parsing announce-list once
<https://github.com/creichert/bencode/issues/12> is fixed.
