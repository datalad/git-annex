sorry looks like i hadd a litle mixup, the full magnet link that i used when checking btshowmetainfo was

    magnet:?xt=urn:btih:88066b90278f2de655ee2dd44e784c340b54e45c&dn=archlinux-2016.02.01-dual.iso&tr=udp://tracker.archlinux.org:6969&tr=http://tracker.archlinux.org:6969/announce

Using this one with aria2c --bt-save-metadata results in a torrent file with the announce-list entry only.
Modifying the link to only contain one tracker url still results in an announce-list with a single entry.

There also is a separate torrent file on the arch website that has the announce field set correctly.

    https://www.archlinux.org/releng/releases/2016.02.01/torrent/

They hide the actuall .torrent file though so addurl doesn't trigger the torrent parsing with led me to try the magnet link to begin with.

Anyway, looks like aria2c is at fault because it doesn't generate standard compliant .torrent files from magnet links.
