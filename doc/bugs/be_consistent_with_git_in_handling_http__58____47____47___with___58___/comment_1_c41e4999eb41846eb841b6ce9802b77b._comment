Not a legal url really, RFC 1738 says "If the port is omitted, the colon is as well."
But web browsers, curl, wget, etc do mostly seem to support it, so at least 
Postel's law seems to apply..

Here's the root cause of it failing:

	ghci> parseRequest "https://datasets.datalad.org:/dbic/QA/.git/"
	*** Exception: InvalidUrlException "https://datasets.datalad.org:/dbic/QA/.git/" "Invalid port"

So http-conduit refuses to parse it and so can't be used to download it.

Filed an issue, but I don't know if they'll want to change
http-conduit to accept a malformed url.
<https://github.com/snoyberg/http-client/issues/501>

Since network-uri is able to parse it, into an URI
that has `"uriPort = ":"`, git-annex could special 
case handling of the empty port there, changing it to ""
and so generating an url that http-conduit can parse.
I've implemented this fix.
