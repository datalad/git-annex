AFAICS, xmpp.l.google.com is the correct XMPP server; it's what the SRV record for googlemail.com says to use.

Since it fails with an authentication error, I wonder if google's XMPP is rejecting a user@googlemail.com jid and expects the domain to be @gmail.com or something else. Would that be allowed by the XMPP spec? I don't know.
