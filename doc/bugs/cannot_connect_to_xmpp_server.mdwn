I cannot get the assistant to connect to my jabber account, db48x@db48x.net. I get the message stating that it may take a minute, which is never updated. At the very least I would expect some sort of error message.

I get the same symptoms if I connect to an account @gmail.com, but type in the wrong password. If I put in the correct password, it connects quite quickly.

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?

[[!format txt """
[db48x@celebdil ~]$ git annex version
git-annex version: 4.20130709
build flags: Assistant Webapp Pairing Testsuite S3 WebDAV Inotify DBus XMPP DNS

(Fedora 18)

I get exactly the same behavior on my phone, which is running Android 4.1.2


### Please provide any additional information below.
