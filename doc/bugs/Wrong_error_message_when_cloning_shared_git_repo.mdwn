### Please describe the problem.

When cloning a repository via SSH that is shared on the remote system (e.g. belongs to a different account), git-annex produces a wrong/misleading error message.


### What steps will reproduce the problem?

1. Create a shared git repository with one account
2. With another account, ensure that git refuses to do anything with the repository: `git annex info` should lead to a "git-annex: Git refuses to operate in this repository" error
3. Clone the repository via ssh with that other account
4. Run `git annex init` in that clone
5. Notice a misleading error message:

```
$ git annex init
init  
  Unable to parse git config from origin

  Remote origin does not have git-annex installed; setting annex-ignore

  This could be a problem with the git-annex installation on the remote. Please make sure that git-annex-shell is available in PATH when you ssh into the remote. Once you have fixed the git-annex installation, run: git annex enableremote origin
ok
(recording state in git...)
```

The error will go away once the safe.directory config is set for the repository:

```
git config --global --add safe.directory <path>
```

This command is correctly suggested in the output of `git annex info` from the above step 2, but since one doesn't always run that first and instead just tries to clone, the misleading error message can cause a bit of wasted time trying to figure out why git-annex wouldn't be available in the PATH when in reality it is.

### Have you had any luck using git-annex before? (Sometimes we get tired of reading bug reports all day and a lil' positive end note does wonders)


> Seems to be fixed by current git and/or git-annex. [[done]] --[[Joey]]
