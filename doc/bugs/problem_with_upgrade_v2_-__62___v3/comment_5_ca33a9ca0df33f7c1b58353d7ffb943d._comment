By the way, the original bug reporter mentioned deleting .git/annex/journal. This is not recommended, and doing it during an upgrade can result in git-annex losing location tracking information. You should probably run `git annex fsck` or reset to the old git tree (and `git config annex.version 2`) and upgrade again.
