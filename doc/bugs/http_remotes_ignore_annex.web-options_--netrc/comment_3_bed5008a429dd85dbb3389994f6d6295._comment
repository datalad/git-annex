Thanks for your attention and for confirming there's an issue!

> Aside from git-credential-netrc, there is not a single mention of the netrc file in git's documentation.

I did notice this. It is a surprising behaviour! I only discovered it because DroneCI discovered it.

If that's your opinion, I would rather make `git config credential.helper store` the canonical solution for noninteractive passworded HTTP, since it works consistently with both `git` and `git-annex`. I think everyone would find it easier to wrap our heads around if the docs dropped the mention of netrc and instead explained that git-annex hooks into git-credential(1) and that everyone should use that.
