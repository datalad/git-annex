Confirmed this behavior.

It is due to withUrlOptionsPromptingCreds, which forces use of conduit
rather than curl. The idea there was to use git credentials when basic
auth is needed. Since those can be provided to conduit but not to curl
(securely).

But I do think that, if the user has forced use of curl, it ought to use curl.
Even if the user only set options to `-4`, and so curl is not going to use
the netrc and will fail the download. I have changed it to do so.

----

This bug report also suggests making git-annex read the netrc file itself.
Note that git does *not* read the netrc file itself. What it does do is use
libcurl. git-annex has good reasons to not use libcurl though.

I am not thrilled by the prospect of implementing a parser for netrc
in git-annex. The file is not even documented on my debian system;
curl's man page links to a `netrc(5)` but that does not exist.

Aside from git-credential-netrc, there is not a single mention of 
the netrc file in git's documentation. This is arguably surprising behavior
on the part of git. 

I feel that git's support for netrc is vestigal and mostly supersceded by
git credentials.
