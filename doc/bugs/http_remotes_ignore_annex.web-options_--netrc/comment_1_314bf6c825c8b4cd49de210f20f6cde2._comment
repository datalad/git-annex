I've found a different workaround. `git` ships with an unmaintained(?) alternate netrc parser written in perl. You just need to install it:

```
[kousu@nigiri ~]$ sudo cp -p /usr/share/git/credential/netrc/git-credential-netrc.perl /usr/lib/git-core/git-credential-netrc  # install
[sudo] password for kousu: 
[kousu@nigiri ~]$ chmod 600 ~/.netrc                                                   # it's rightly picky about permissions
[kousu@nigiri ~]$ git config --global credential.helper \"netrc -v\"
[kousu@nigiri tmp.HBEKK9D4TS]$ cd $(mktemp -d)
[kousu@nigiri tmp.oZpfrzbN2N]$ git clone http://localhost/.git annex-test              # this use ~/.netrc *directly*
Cloning into 'annex-test'...
[kousu@nigiri tmp.oZpfrzbN2N]$ cd annex-test/
[kousu@nigiri annex-test]$ git annex get                                               # this uses ~/.netrc indirectly via git-credential
get large.bin (from origin...) 
using gpg for GPG operations
Unable to read /home/kousu/.authinfo.gpg; skipping it
Unable to read /home/kousu/.netrc.gpg; skipping it
Unable to read /home/kousu/.authinfo; skipping it
Opening /home/kousu/.netrc...
ok
(recording state in git...)
```


This seems to sidestep the problem! It's weird that `git clone` will read netrc directly, but `git credential fill` won't? Oh well.

There's a [SO post](https://stackoverflow.com/a/31609584/2898673) about this script.


I still think it would be good for the docs and the code to be made consistent: if `web-options` is supposed to invoke curl then make it invoke curl, or else not the corner cases where it won't invoke curl.

Hope this helps someone out down the road.
