It seems that `git annex repair` also ignores such issues:

    $ git annex repair
    Running git fsck ...
    Initialized empty Git repository in /tmp/tmprepo.0/.git/
    Trying to recover missing objects from remote home.
    Unpacking all pack files.
    error: file write error (No space left on device)
    fatal: unable to write sha1 file
    Successfully recovered repository!
    You should run \"git fsck\" to make sure, but it looks like everything was recovered ok.
    ok
