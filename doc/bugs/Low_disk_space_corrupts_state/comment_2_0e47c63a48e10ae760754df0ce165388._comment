I suggest that you first free up some disk space, and only then try to run
`git annex repair`.

I checked, and git-annex repair actually has a legitimate reason for
ignoring the error to unpack a pack file. The pack file could be corrupt.
It can't tell why git fails to unpack a pack file, so can't detect that
it's due to low disk space.

I don't know if git-repair managed to get your repository back to a working
state (although with git history lost) or not. It seems like it thinks
it managed to repair the repo enough for it to work, is that not the case?
