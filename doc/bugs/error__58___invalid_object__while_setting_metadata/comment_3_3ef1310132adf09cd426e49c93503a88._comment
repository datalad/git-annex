This certianly looks like a file handle leak in git-annex filter-process..

A workaround for you would be to run:

	git config --unset filter.annex.process

I have tried to reproduce this. I made a repository with 10000 files,
all annexed and unlocked. I upgraded it to repository version 9. I checked
out a commit where all the files were not present yet, and then checked out
a commit that had all the files present. It did not fail, and also I never
saw it having more than a few files open.

So there must be something else about your repository that is needed to
reproduce this..

(Weirdly, signal 15 is SIGTERM, so I don't know what would have caused it to
receive that signal unless it was ctrl-c'd.)
