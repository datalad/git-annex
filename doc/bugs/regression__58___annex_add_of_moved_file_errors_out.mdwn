### Please describe the problem.

```bash

cd "$(mktemp -d ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/dl-XXXXXXX)"
set -eu

git init
git annex init

echo 123 > 123
git annex add 123
git commit -m 'commit 123'

mkdir sub
mv 123 sub
git annex add sub/123
git commit -m 'committing moved'

```

crashes with

```

add sub/123 
git-annex: sub/123: rename: does not exist (No such file or directory)

```

with recent (after 10.20220525+git96-gf259be7f3, full range for when bug introduced AFAIK is 10.20220525+git81-g8916c818b..10.20220525+git96-gf259be7f3) git-annex

As this is such a basic operation, I am still wondering how come it is not caught by git-annex tests and only 1 of our datalad tests managed to pick this up!
