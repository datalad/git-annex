### Please describe the problem.

When the assistant is running, using "git annex unlock" on the commandline may lead to unexpected results.

### What steps will reproduce the problem?

Make sure the assitant is running on a repository.

`git annex unlock somefiles`, try to edit them, wait a while, try to edit.

If you're not lucky, the assistant will notice the unlocked files as new and will add them back, locking them in the process, and you won't be able to save them.

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?

debian wheezy.
