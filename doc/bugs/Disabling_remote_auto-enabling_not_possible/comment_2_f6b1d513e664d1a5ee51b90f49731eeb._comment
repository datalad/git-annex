Yes, in this particular case the situation is as you describe it. The remote itself is fine for a select few, but I (and others) do not have the necessary means to access it. I want to disable autoenable in my \"fork\" to streamline usage for myself and people like me.

I think your proposed solution would work well for this scenario. Thanks!
