Seems that `git-annex configremote` would be very limited in what
configuration it can change. Changing configuration with enableremote
re-runs the `setup` method, which is passed a RemoteConfig with the user's
proposed changes and can either fail if the config is not valid, or return
a RemoteConfig that might not be the same as the input one. Since `setup` also
prepares to use the remote, which is what's failing when the remote is not
accessible, it could not be used by `configremote`.

So, I think autoenable is about the only config setting that it would make
sense for configremote to be able to change. Changing anything else would
risk storing a configuration that `setup` would not allow. Which could
break the remote in arbitrary ways.
