`git-annex dead` will work.

But it does seem to me that there is perhaps room to have a way 
to clear the autoenable setting without killing the remote entirely,
but without needing to be able to enableremote the remote.

And I think, when you say "The special remote is (no longer) accessible to
everyone" you mean some people still have access, right? But you're not
one of those people and want to disable the autoenable.

If so, I ought to add something like `git-annex configremote foo
autoenable=false`.
