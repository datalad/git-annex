Hmm, you could dead it in your fork. The issue would be, if they ever merge
from it, their working repo will get marked as dead.

A `git-annex configremote` would likewise cause them problems if they
merged from your fork, if they rely on autoenabling being enabled. That's
less likely to be a problem to them I suppose.
