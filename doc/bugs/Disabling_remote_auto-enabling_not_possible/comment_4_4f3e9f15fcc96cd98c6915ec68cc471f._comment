A sub-bug here is that enableremote of a normal git remote adding autoenable=false
always fails with 
"That is a normal git remote; passing these parameters does not make sense: autoenable=false".

That happens even when the repo is accessible. So there is no way to disable
a normal git remote that has been initremoted with autoenable=true.

Update: Fixed that.
