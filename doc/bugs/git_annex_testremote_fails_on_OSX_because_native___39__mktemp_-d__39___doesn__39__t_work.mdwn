### Please describe the problem.

Created a special remote using one drive.
ran git annex testremote <that remote>
got errors, apparently starting with:

    retrieveKeyFile:                 usage: mktemp [-d] [-q] [-t prefix] [-u] template ...
    mktemp [-d] [-q] [-u] -t prefix 
    FAIL (0.01s

### What steps will reproduce the problem?

As above.

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?
OSX 10.10.5 https://downloads.kitenet.net/git-annex/OSX/current/10.10_Yosemite/git-annex.dmg 

### Please provide any additional information below.

Verified that using gnu coreutils mktemp fixes the problem.
Suggestion: Bundle that with the distribution.
Along those lines, consider also including rclone and the script git-annex-remote-rclone,

### Have you had any luck using git-annex before? (Sometimes we get tired of reading bug reports all day and a lil' positive end note does wonders)

Just starting but have high hopes :-)
