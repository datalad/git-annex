### Please describe the problem.

Running `git annex init` on an [unRAID server](https://lime-technology.com/what-is-unraid/) results in an annex created with `crippledfilesystem = true` and `direct = true`. I understand from reading [this](https://git-annex.branchable.com/design/assistant/blog/day_188__crippled_filesystem_support/) that it occurs when `git annex init` performs a probe to determine if all of the following are supported:

1. symlinks
2. hard links
3. unix permissions

Although unRAID disks are formatted with xfs, and therefore support all three of the above, I'm assuming that unRAID's method of combining multiple disks into one "share" is the cause of the problem (hardlinks still work on a single disk, but not on shares that span multiple disks). Symlinks and unix permissions work normally in the unRAID-created shares.

Is there any way to allow the use of 'indirect' mode with multi-disk shares? As I mentioned, symlinks and unix permissions work normally--it's only the hardlinks that won't work across the multi-disk shares.

I can create a 'normal' annex as long as I `cd` to a single disk drive first--what would happen if the annex was later moved onto a multi-disk share? Would it still work? Would it fail gracefully? Would it cause data loss?

### What steps will reproduce the problem?

    cd /mnt/user/NameOfShare
    git init
    git annex init

The following will result in the creation of a 'normal' indirect share:

    cd /mnt/disk1
    git init
    git annex init

### Have you had any luck using git-annex before? (Sometimes we get tired of reading bug reports all day and a lil' positive end note does wonders)

Has been working great, so far, except for the above.
