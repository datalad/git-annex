git-annex move takes care to handle resuming an interrupted move, where the
dest received the object, but the drop did not happen before it was
interrupted.

But, the more common case than being interrupted with ctrl-c or power loss
is the drop failing due to a network issue. In this case, re-running move
does not let the drop succeed in cases where the original move would have
let the drop succeed.

The problem is that logMove runs its cleanup action in this case.
So the move.log gets the record of the move cleaned from it. It seems that
the cleanup action should avoid doing that when the move failed. --[[Joey]]
