### Please describe the problem.
I paired my repo running on Gentoo (git-annex 4.20130601) with Ubuntu 13.04 (git-annex 3.10121112ubuntu4). The repo on Ubuntu doesn't have uuid for the Gentoo remote, so:

- There is no name in assistan's repo settings for it

- Trying to access its settings gives Internal server error: Unknown UUID
15/Jun/2013:12:39:10 +0300 [Error#yesod-core] Unknown UUID @(yesod-core-1.1.8.3:Yesod.Internal.Core ./Yesod/Internal/Core.hs:550:5)

- In dashboard on Ubuntu all changes stay queued forever (although the syncing seems to work)

### What steps will reproduce the problem?
Pair local computers with different annex versions.

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?
Gentoo (git-annex 4.20130601)
Ubuntu 13.04 (git-annex 3.10121112ubuntu4)

### Please provide any additional information below.
