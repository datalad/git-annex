In [[!commit 54ad1b4cfb1c8302f1b862cb2699ab9351e3eb5b]] I fully worked
around this class of problems with unix-compat.

I think it's reasonably likely that every access of a file in git-annex
on Windows now goes through UNC-style normalization, allowing long
filenames to be used. Assuming that everything in ghc base does it, which I
think it does.

So good chance this is fixed now..
