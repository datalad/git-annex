Seems like my renamePath fix did work, because looking back at the origianl
failure log, it was failing to generate test keys, before it got to run the
test cases at all.

The new failures seem likely to be due to getFileStatus/getSymbolicLinkStatus 
failing on the long filename on windows, as I suspected might happen in
comment #3. I've updated the issue at
<https://github.com/jacobstanley/unix-compat/issues/56>. And maybe that
will get fixed, my understanding is that unix-compat has a new maintainer
recently. But, git-annex does contain a convertToNativeNamespace function
that it could use to work around the problem itself.

(I am able to run Windows in emulation, but it's sufficiently slow and disk
hog that I generally am not in a position to do it easily and appreciate
users who can save me the bother.)
