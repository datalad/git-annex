Actually testremote will not accept --backend in current master, since that
is no longer a global option and is accepted only by commands that can
actually use it.

testremote cannot support an arbitrary backend here, because it needs to
generate a test key that cannot possibly be used for real data. The only
backend that has a way implemented to do that is SHA256. It would not,
for example, be possible to make the WORM backend support that, since every
possible WORM key could be used by real data.

It would be possible to add support for --backend=MD5 and have it reject
other backends. But this does not strike me as solving the real problem.

Also, in [[bugs/tests_fail_on_windows__58___retrieveKeyFile_resume]]
I ran into this same problem, when `git-annex test` was ran, and
worked around it by disabling that part of the test suite on windows.
If this is fixed, it would be worth re-enabling that, although it may have
also been failing for other reasons on windows.
