### Please describe the problem.

Module `System.PosixCompat.User` has been removed in `unix-compat-0.7` (see
[changelog](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/unix-compat-0.7/changelog)). As
a result, git-annex failed to build, with the following error:

```
Starting     git-annex-10.20230329 (all, legacy fallback)
Error: cabal: Failed to build git-annex-10.20230329. The failure occurred
during the configure step. The exception was:

```

### What steps will reproduce the problem?

```
cabal v2-update
cabal v2-install --jobs=8 --max-backjumps=100000 --install-method=copy --installdir=/opt/homebrew/Cellar/git-annex/10.20230329/bin --flags=+S3
```

(Note: I omitted some workarounds used to build with GHC >= 9.2. The full
package description for building git-annex can be found
[here](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/blob/83f9beeb6ce6d44cd06856f4e9fc513e80cd237d/Formula/git-annex.rb).)

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?

git-annex: 10.20230329 (But it failed with 10.20230321, too.)

OS: macOS 11, 12, 13 (x86_64 and arm64), Ubuntu 22.04 (x86_64)

### Please provide any additional information below.

The error was observed while packaging git-annex for Homebrew
[here](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/pull/127002). Currently, that's
being worked around by restricting `unix-compat` version to `>= 0.5 && < 0.7` in
`git-annex.cabal`.

### Have you had any luck using git-annex before? (Sometimes we get tired of reading bug reports all day and a lil' positive end note does wonders)

Sorry, I'm not a git-annex user. I'm a maintainer of the Homebrew package
manager, and I help to make the newest git-annex available to our users.

Thanks for all your work maintaining git-annex!
