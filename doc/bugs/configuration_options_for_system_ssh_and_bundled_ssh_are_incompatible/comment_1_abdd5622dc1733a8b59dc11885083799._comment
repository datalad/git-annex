One way to deal with this would be to put the bundled ssh in the
git-annex.linux/extra/ directory. Programs in that directory are added to the
end of the path, so that system versions will be preferred when available.

That was earlier done for gpg and didn't cause any problems.

There is the potential for some sort of versioning problem. Currently the
only thing git-annex probes about the bundled ssh is if it supports
connection caching. That's quite an old feature by now, so a system ssh not
supporting it would either be super out of date and insecure openssh, or
perhaps some other ssh implementation.

Seems worth moving the bundled ssh to the extra directory, and see what
breaks..
