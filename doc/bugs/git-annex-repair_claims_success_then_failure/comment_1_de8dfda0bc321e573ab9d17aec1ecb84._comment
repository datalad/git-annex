I was able to reproduce this bug!

	git-annex init
	rm -rf .git/annex
	git-annex repair

	git-annex: .git/annex/journal/: openDirStream: does not exist (No such file or directory)

That's with Annex.Repair modified to always run commitindex. Having a
repository with a git-annex branch that is corrupt, would have the same effect
as that modification.

Fixed this.
