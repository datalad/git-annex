I was able to reproduce this by feeding 10 urls into git-annex addurl
-J5 and got 7 hash-object processes running.

filter.annex.process has nothing to do with this. I reproduced the behavior
without it set.

Seems like a simple concurrency issue, where each thread potentially starts
its own hash-object handle, and there can be around 2x as many threads
started as the -J number due to job stages. Annex.Concurrent sets up pools of
handles for other similar git processes, but not hash-object.
