our comments crossed in the hyperspace... ;)  yeah -- I would have expected a separate lock file to be used for such cases.  Now data loss is really a possibility (almost made it happen since opened the file and wrote it without unlocking, good that I caught it and was able to modify back exactly the way it was).  Interactions among multiple versions of annex on the same repo is imho a lesser possibility (would require two different versions of annex being available)
