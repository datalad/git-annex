Found a following comment in the code
[[!format haskell \"\"\"
{- Normally, blocks writing to an annexed file, and modifies file
 - permissions to allow reading it.
 -
 - When core.sharedRepository is set, the write bits are not removed from
 - the file, but instead the appropriate group write bits are set. This is
 - necessary to let other users in the group lock the file. But, in a
 - shared repository, the current user may not be able to change a file
 - owned by another user, so failure to set this mode is ignored.

\"\"\"]]
So may be it is a \"Feature\" although killing the whole premise of data safety while using git-annex.

In my case, shared permissions are primarily to make files/repositories readable by others, so may be I should have not used 'shared' mode anyways, since reading does not need the shared setting
