> Making the file read-only will not prevent a lot of things renaming over top of it. (Including vim!)

not exactly... removing write permission from the key file at least makes vim report that the file read-only and disallowing (without force) to overwrite it.  That is my use case where I keep burning myself constantly (e.g. this morning again).  Need to not forget to switch all \"shared\" repos back to the single user mode.  One of the promises of git-annex is that data is safe, and this mode just violates it wildly.
