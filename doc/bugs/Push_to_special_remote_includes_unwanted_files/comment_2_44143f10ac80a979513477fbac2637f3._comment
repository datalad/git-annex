Yes, copying .h but not .c would be an example. It makes a mess of the special remote's directory structure.

Export has the same problem, so there is no way to copy files to the special remote without making a mess.

Import does it correctly going the other way by *not* grabbing files *wanted* by the repository but *not wanted* the special remote. I believe symmetry is desirable in this case.

Please provide a way to copy to a special remote with import-like filtering.
