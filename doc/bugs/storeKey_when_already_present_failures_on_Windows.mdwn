### Please describe the problem.
Now we have github action which builds git-annex with libmagic support.  Unfortunately we had to "allow" `git annex test` to fail to proceed for now. Although it looks not that bad -- there is only one "test" which fails in various scenarios (to the total of `12 out of 704 tests failed (616.78s)`)

When I ran `annex test` after installing that installer in a local Win 10 VM, I have got a lesser count (`8 out of 704 tests failed (1197.82s)`)  [full log](http://www.onerussian.com/tmp/git-annex-windows-failures-8.20201008-g577af1b-local.log)
