My laptop now has SHA256 in hardware I assume, as I'm seeing similar speed
differences. Eg:

	joey@darkstar:~/tmp/x3>time sha256sum x
	e1f21b651362cf2f86ccc14a7376c33a49f30d7d14afe1ec6993eead5e8cfe41  x
	0.53user 0.17system 0:00.71elapsed 99%CPU (0avgtext+0avgdata 3712maxresident)k
	32inputs+0outputs (1major+239minor)pagefaults 0swaps
	joey@darkstar:~/tmp/x3>time git-annex fsck x
	fsck x (checksum...) ok
	(recording state in git...)
	3.22user 0.40system 0:03.63elapsed 100%CPU (0avgtext+0avgdata 61180maxresident)k

I agree that this bug should be left open since even a relatively low-end laptop
now has this, git-annex shouldn't leave so much performance on the table.

I've opened an issue on crypton:
<https://github.com/kazu-yamamoto/crypton/issues/31>

If it's rejected from crypton, I'm open to considering another library. 
I'd rather avoid OpenSSL wrappers because adding a C library dependency on openssl
will complicate building git-annex in some situations. It would be better to
have a haskell library that, like cryptonite, embeds the necessary C code.

Also, whatever library git-annex uses needs to support incremental hashing,
otherwise git-annex has to pay a performance penalty of re-reading a file to hash
it after download, rather than hashing while downloading.
