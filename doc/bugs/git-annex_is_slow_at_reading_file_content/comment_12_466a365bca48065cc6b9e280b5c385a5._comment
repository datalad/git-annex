Thank you for looking into this again.

> I'd rather avoid OpenSSL wrappers because adding a C library dependency on openssl will complicate building git-annex in some situations.

Would it be possible to make this a build-time option perhaps?

git-annex without SIMD hashing obviously still *works* fast enough for many purposes as its the status quo but having it would be a greatly appreciated optimisation by many. It'd be great to have the option to enable it wherever possible and simply fall back to non-SIMD where it isn't.

> Also, whatever library git-annex uses needs to support incremental hashing, otherwise git-annex has to pay a performance penalty of re-reading a file to hash it after download, rather than hashing while downloading.

Agreed. Incremental hashing is too important to lose over a general optimisation like this.
