Upstream does not seem interested in improving performance. Are there alternative libraries that could be used instead?

Would it be possible to use OpenSSL somehow perhaps?

AFAICT git-annex hooks into the hashing routine for things like progress monitoring. Perhaps those could be re-architected to work with an external \"black box\" library or process?
