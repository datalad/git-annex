What steps will reproduce the problem?

I was trying to add a remote server repository. Unfortunately, this didn't work. Enter Host name, user name, directory, port
(left most of them at their default), but there is no way, to specify a password.) Clicking check this server failed:

 Failed to ssh to the server. Transcript: Permission denied, please try again. Permission denied, please try again. Permission denied (publickey,password). 

(Problem was, I could never enter a password. Interestingly, on the konsole, I get a prompt for a password, but I can't enter anything there).


What is the expected output? What do you see instead?

Successfully create a connection and use the remote server.


What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?
Version: 3.20130124
