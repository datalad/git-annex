### Please describe the problem.

I am running `git-annex test`, it stops on an NFS mount with exhausted resources (too many open FDs).

Then I try to remove the `.t` directory with `rm -rf .t` and get many errors like:

```
rm: cannot remove `.t/tmprepo61/.git/annex/objects/96/qw/SHA256E-s10--bcc2eba25d48be76c9d968f2d818196b0e10e13476dcff75371fc0ca4910450c/SHA256E-s10--bcc2eba25d48be76c9d968f2d818196b0e10e13476dcff75371fc0ca4910450c': Permission denied
```

The permissions on those files look normal (they are mine).

### What steps will reproduce the problem?

see above

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?

git HEAD (self-built). On Linux.

### Please provide any additional information below.

[[!format sh """
# If you can, paste a complete transcript of the problem occurring here.
# If the problem is with the git-annex assistant, paste in .git/annex/daemon.log


# End of transcript or log.

### Have you had any luck using git-annex before? (Sometimes we get tired of reading bug reports all day and a lil' positive end note does wonders)

On /tmp the self-test works. Maybe it is related to NFS?
