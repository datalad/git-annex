the same problem also shows up with `git annex get`:

    get …filename… (from prometheus...) 
    rsync: change_dir \"/home/shared/photos/encrypted_storage/63e/50b/GPGHMACSHA1--b83e8aaf05918ae2fc81652368f9d4068f938625\" failed: No such file or directory (2)

    rsync error: some files/attrs were not transferred (see previous errors) (code 23) at main.c(1536) [Receiver=3.0.9]

    ok

again, it says \"ok\", but the \"no such file or directory\" / \"rsync failed\" is visually more prominent.
