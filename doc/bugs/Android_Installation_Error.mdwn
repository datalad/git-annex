### Please describe the problem.

When attempting to install git-annex in Termux on an Android device, the following error is received:

    Running on Android.. Tuning for optimal behavior.
    sed: can't read /data/data/com.termux/files/home/git-annex.linux/git-remote-annex: No such file or directory

The installation fails and git-annex cannot be run.

### What steps will reproduce the problem?

Following the instructions found at <https://git-annex.branchable.com/Android/>:

    pkg install wget
    wget https://git-annex.branchable.com/install/Android/git-annex-install
    source git-annex-install

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?

* git-annex: I have tried both the latest and the nightly builds of arm64 ancient as of 2024-09-30.
* Android 14
* Termux 0.118.1

### Please provide any additional information below.

I have tried downloading the `.tar.gz` file and extracting it manually. Inside I find the file `git-remote-annex`.  I then run `./runshell`, receive the error above, and when I `ls` the directory, I find that the file `git-remote-annex` is missing from the folder.  This seems to be a case of the file being moved by the installer before it can be modified by `sed`.

### Have you had any luck using git-annex before? (Sometimes we get tired of reading bug reports all day and a lil' positive end note does wonders)

Works great on all of my Fedora, Ubuntu, and Rocky machines!
