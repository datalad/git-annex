Nowadays, -J1 does not have that behavior but eg -J2 still does. But I'd
probably just use --quiet in my cron job, or for that matter use `chronic`.

I do think it would be better for git-annex to be consistent and not
display progress when not at a tty. However, the work required to do that
is nontrivial. A lot of commands git-annex runs can themselves display
progress. And all that nontrivial work has in fact been done in order to
support -J. It's just not enabled by default or for -J1.

The reason git-annex has not yet switched to the concurrent output by
default is that it assumes a VT100 compatible terminal.
