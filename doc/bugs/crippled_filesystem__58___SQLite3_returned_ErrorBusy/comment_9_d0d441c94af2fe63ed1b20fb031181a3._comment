@yoh Mounting the cifs filesystem with nobrl should avoid the problem.
To make that safe, you *also* need to set annex.pidlock.

Setting annex.pidlock on its own will not help.

I don't think that git-annex can be changed in any way that makes sqlite
work on this filesystem in its default state. What I discussed in comment
#7 seems like the only feasible improvement to git-annex and would only
help the user learn about the mount option.
