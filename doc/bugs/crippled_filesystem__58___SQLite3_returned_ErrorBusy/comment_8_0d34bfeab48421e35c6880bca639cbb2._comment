We have got user of cifs filesystem mount [reprorting](https://github.com/datalad/datalad/issues/6917#issuecomment-1206358866) that setting pidlock didn't help while using git-annex 10.20220504-g35cafb7 and cifs mount with options 

```
type cifs (rw,relatime,vers=default,sec=krb5,cache=strict,multiuser,uid=164445,noforceuid,gid=100513,noforcegid,addr=172.19
```

Please advise to how to troubleshoot such situation.

NB I might later try similarish cifs mount of our local HPC which I believe might expose it similarly.
