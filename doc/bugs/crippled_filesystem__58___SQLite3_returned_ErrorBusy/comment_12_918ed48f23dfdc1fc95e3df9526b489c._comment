annex.dbdir is now implemented.

This issue remains open because `git-annex init` ought to probe to
determine when sqlite cannot be used on the repository's filesystem.
I don't think it could itself set annex.dbdir to work around the
problem, because what would it set it to? But it could explain the problem
to the user and suggest that they set it.
