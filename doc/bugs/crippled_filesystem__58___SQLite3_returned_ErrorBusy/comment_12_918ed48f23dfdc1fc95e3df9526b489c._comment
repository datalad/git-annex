annex.dbdir is now implemented. Note that it can safely be set to the same
path in several repositories. If all your repositories were on cifs,
you could even set it globally.

This issue remains open because `git-annex init` ought to probe to
determine when sqlite cannot be used on the repository's filesystem.
I don't think it could itself set annex.dbdir to work around the
problem, because what would it set it to? Maybe
`~/.cache/git-annex/something`? Seems better for it to explain the
problem to the user and suggest that they set it.
