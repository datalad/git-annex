Is the repository using direct mode?

Another theory is that:

* test/hello appears
* watcher sees new symlink, tries to make a commit with it
* master branch already has that symlink
* this is why the write-tree is not followed by a commit-tree. The commit would have been empty. 

If this is the case, then 84068090af4bcd3d24f16d865ac07b0478f20ada will be a ref on the master branch.

And all of the above is normal operation. But it does suggest, that if this repo is in direct mode, it might be running a direct mode work tree update around then. Which requires a lot of cat-file queries of the git-annex branch. And would certainly make repeated queries at least if the repository has duplicate copies of some files..
