All I can tell from the strace is that it's looking at location logs, and it's looking at the same few keys, but not a single on in a tight loop.

It would probably help a lot to run the assistant with --debug and get a debug log while this is going on. We need to pinpoint the part of the assistant that is affected, and there may be other activity too.
