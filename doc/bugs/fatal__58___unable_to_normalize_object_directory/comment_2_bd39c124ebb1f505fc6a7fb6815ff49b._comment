"fatal: unable to normalize object directory" is an error message that
git emits, not git-annex.

I wonder if git-annex's use of --work-tree and --git-dir with
relative paths confuses git in some way?

It would be good to explain how to reproduce this problem.
I tried a few things involving symlinks in the path I `cd`ed to, 
but was not able to cause the problem.
