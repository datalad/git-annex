### Please describe the problem.

Initially generated an annex while having a restrictive umask 077.  Then cloned that repository to another host for public consumption so directory had proper/good permissions set allowing group to access.  And everything is accessible but not the load which I 'annex get'ed.  Key directories were readable but not the content.  I guess there is somewhere 'preserve permissions' setting for rsync/scp which imho shouldn't be there and content should inherit local/environment settings

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?

6.20160208+gitg1ac9034-1~ndall+1
