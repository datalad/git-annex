i hit that thing again, utterly confused. it happens all the time with my laptop, which has access to my workstation, but not the other way around. so from the POV of my laptop, things make sense somehow, but from the workstation, the laptop doesn't show up at all, and when there's a transfer, it says it's into the unknown.

really confusing... surely there's a way to show the remote name at least...
