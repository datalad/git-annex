The only other thing I can think to do about this is to make git-annex block
direct pushes to the git-annex branch, by setting up a pre-receive hook.

Then, there should be no way for the race to occur
(except for a locking failure, or a pull into the branch?),
and git-annex wouldn't need to check for it
