I've been experiencing the exact same problem and searching for **recovery from race** lead me to this bug report. Thanks for reporting it!

For a few months, a repo storing ~19'000 files (mostly immutable pictures) started to launch memory hungry \"git log\" processes. For example:

    4797 francois  20   0 8118296 7.719g   2032 D  22.3 50.2   0:11.61 git                                                                                                   

    4797 pts/1    D+     0:12 git --git-dir=~/Pictures/.git --work-tree=~/Pictures -c core.bare=false log refs/heads/git-annex..52e44b967ad5d316d832562be02c5555c1f6d2a4 --oneline -n1

Thanks to the hints found in this report, I was able to find many huge commit messages such as this one:

    $ git show 6357b208 
    commit 6357b2081e7c85dfe1ccc10824b75f3e212e6386

    $ git show 6357b208 | wc

There were probably many new files added on Jun 14th and looking for a way to increase to sync speed, especially to a S3-like remote, I found the solution on this wiki for [multiple concurrent transfers](https://git-annex.branchable.com/forum/Feature_request:_Multiple_concurrent_transfers/).

This looks like a likely culprit for generating race conditions. What do you think?
