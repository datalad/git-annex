Is there one commit with this long message, or 12 thousand commits each adding another (recovery from race) to the pyramid?

<pre>
 - Also safely handles a race that can occur if a change is being pushed
 - into the branch at the same time. When the race happens, the commit will
 - be made on top of the newly pushed change, but without the index file
 - being updated to include it. The result is that the newly pushed
 - change is reverted. This race is detected and another commit made
 - to fix it.
</pre>

If there is only one message, then it must have tried 12k times to commit to the git-annex branch and each time something else pushed or commited to the git-annex branch and overwrote its commit. This seems statistically unlikely. (Also there's locking to prevent multiple local git-annex processes from committing at the same time.)

There have been a few other unexplained reports of this race detection code repeatedly triggering.

This implies some hasty, perhaps unusual shutdown method, and some unusual situation. I think you could tell me more about what was going on.
