Something that prevents `git config` from working, or prevents it from
listing an annex.uuid for the remote, seems like the overridingly likely
reason for their problem. (You were asking the right questions 
[here](https://github.com/datalad/datalad/issues/7371#issuecomment-1545975295)
and I don't think they really answered them, unless it happened in your office
hours.)

I've made --debug include the output of `git config --list`,
which allows seeing if a problem prevents git from reading the config of
the remote.

I also made the debug output tell what directory it's running a command in
when it's not the pwd.

So, for example:

	[2023-05-15 15:16:01.414302245] (Utility.Process) process [59665] read: git ["config","--null","--list"] in "/home/joey/tmp/a"
	[2023-05-15 15:16:01.419396816] (Git.Config) git config read: [("",[]),("annex.uuid",["9553f51c-87ad-4321-86fb-de4aa630e997"]) [...]
