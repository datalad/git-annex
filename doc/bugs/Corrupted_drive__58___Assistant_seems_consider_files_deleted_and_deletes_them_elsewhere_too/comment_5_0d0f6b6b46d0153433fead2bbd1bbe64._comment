The assistant autorecovered my work repo before I noticed, so it looks like I can't provide the necessary info. There were a bunch of files missing that got re-synced from my home PC.

For what it's worth, I noticed that on my phone, when cutting the internet connection while syncing, the assistant downloaded existing files into placeholder files, and then continued actually downloading files when the network connection was restored.
