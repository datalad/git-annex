Sorry, missed the comment.

My work repo is the repository on my work laptop, where deletions got synced to.

Git annex had then run repository repair automatically, so the odd symlinks where no longer there for me to check out.

It is possible that I ran some git commands in direct mode I shouldn't have; I put the files back in and it's working nicely now. So this might have been a \"no direct mode guard\" issue.
