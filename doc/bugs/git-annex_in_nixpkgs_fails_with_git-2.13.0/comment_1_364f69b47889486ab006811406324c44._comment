Not nix-specific, I can reproduce with self-built git.

Bisecting git itself (rather than nix):

	f57f37e2e1bf11ab4cdfd221ad47e961ba9353a0 is the first bad commit
	commit f57f37e2e1bf11ab4cdfd221ad47e961ba9353a0

	    files-backend: remove the use of git_path()

That commit seems has to do with paths used for refs, and the test suite is
failing due to something involving pushing/merging the
synced/master branch. So, it's looking like a git bug.

In particular, this just seems outright wrong:

	From ../../.t/tmprepo44
	 * [new branch]      git-annex     -> r1/git-annex
	 * [new branch]      master        -> r1/master
	 * [new branch]      synced/master -> r1/synced/master
	merge: refs/remotes/r1/master - not something we can merge
	merge: refs/remotes/r1/synced/master - not something we can merge

So, it's just pulled synced/master to r1/synced/master, but then it claims
refs/remotes/r1/synced/master is not mergable.

This only affects adjusted branches because git has a reversion in the
`GIT_COMMON_DIR` that they use.
