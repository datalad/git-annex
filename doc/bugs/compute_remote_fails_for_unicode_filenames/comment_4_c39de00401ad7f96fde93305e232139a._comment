Nice work investigating this. I would not have guessed a kernel bug might
be involved. But I am not convinced one is, either.

I agree with your analysis of your strace. The filename is getting into
git-annex ok. Then it runs the compute program with the mangled filename.

I don't see how a kernel bug would cause git-annex to mangle the filename
though. As far as `git-annex addcomputed` is concerned, the filename is
just a parameter to use as input to the computation. Such parameters are
not limited to filenames actually. And so they pass through `git-annex
addcomputed` without being exposed to any kernel syscall that might do
something wrong on a buggy kernel.

Unless, that is, the haskell `process` library, or indeed the kernel
itself, does something with parameters passed to the compute program.

(This strace does rule out my theories around `hGetLineUntilExitOrEOF`.)

What are the versions of git-annex in the VM where it worked vs
where it didn't?

And, if you can possibly download and unpack the linuxstandalone tarball,
and use that to run git-annex in the bad VM, that would be a useful check
that the problem does not somehow involve the homebrew build.
