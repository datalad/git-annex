I don't see how git-annex could be stripping even invalid unicode here.
When it runs the compute program it uses `process` with `CreatePipe`. That
is documented to use the default encoding. git-annex sets the default
encoding in `useFileSystemEncoding`.

With that said, git-annex is here using `hGetLineUntilExitOrEOF`, and if
`hGetChar` ever failed with an encoding error, it does look like that
would skip over the problem and return the rest of the string.

It would not hurt to throw in a `fileEncoding` on the compute process's
handles, but I'd really want to be able to reproduce this first.

I have also tried with filenames that are not valid unicode at all, and
they pass through ok. Eg:

	invalid_byte_sequence=$'\x80\x81'
	echo hi > invalid$(printf %s $invalid_byte_sequence)
	git-annex add invalid*
	git annex addcomputed --to=passthrough invalid* invalidout
	cat invalidout
	hi
