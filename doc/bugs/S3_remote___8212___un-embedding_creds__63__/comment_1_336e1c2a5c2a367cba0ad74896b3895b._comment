When you used embedcreds=yes, it *committed* the creds to the git-annex
branch of the git repository. For embedcreds=no to do anything useful,
it would need to remove that data from the git repository history.

Removing data from a git repository tends to involve rewriting commits and
forced pushes to all remotes, it's not a simple process and not ameanable
to automation. It will be much easier, and more secure, to go into S3
and generate new credentials, and revoke access to the old ones.

What `git annex enableremote` with `embedcreds=no` does do is prevent
any new creds from being embedded into the repository. Otherwise,
`git annex enableremote` will update the embedded creds
with whatever new ones are set in the environment when you run it.
