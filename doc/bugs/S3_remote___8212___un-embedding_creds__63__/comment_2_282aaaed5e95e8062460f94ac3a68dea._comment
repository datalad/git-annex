Sure, that’s what I did at the very beginning (revoking the creds on AWS).

But still, when I clone this repo, `git annex info S3` in this fresh clone, says that credentials are embedded. This is a bit misleading.

Maybe updating S3 configuration with `embedcreds=no` could change that behavior?

It wouldn’t matter from the security standpoint (which is solved by changing permissions directly on AWS), but would simply be beneficial for usability. =)
