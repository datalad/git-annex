Are you sure it's git-annex that's making the connections, and not
git-remote-gcrypt? What kind of uri are you using?

I tried to reproduce such a problem, making this gcrypt special remote:

git annex initremote gcrypt type=gcrypt gitrepo=ssh://localhost/tmp/r encryption=shared --fast

When I `git annex sync gcrypt`, only 1 ssh connection is made:

joey@darkstar:~/tmp/meep>systemctl status ssh.socket | grep Accepted  
 Accepted: 80; Connected: 1  
joey@darkstar:~/tmp/meep>git annex sync gcrypt >/dev/null 2>&1  
joey@darkstar:~/tmp/meep>systemctl status ssh.socket | grep Accepted  
 Accepted: 81; Connected: 1  

git-annex's ssh connection caching code is working for this gcrypt remote,
because git-annex's `GIT_SSH=` is being propigated through gcrypt to git
push and pull.
