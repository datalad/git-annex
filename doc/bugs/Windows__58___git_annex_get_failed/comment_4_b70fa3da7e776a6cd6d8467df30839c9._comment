I pulled and checked 6.20160408-gf970490. <br/>
There are several problems now: <br/>

1. When I `sync` on a new repo it `get`s all the files<br/>
2. `drop` doesn't drop the file
3. `lock` doesn't work <br/>
4. I don't know if the problem with `get` really fixed because it isn't needed

Btw, look at my comment on /todo/smudge (maybe put on a wrong page) <br/>
I think using hardlinks on windows can fix many problems here ( adjusted/direct mode which I hate :)) ) <br/>
And it should need little work as tools already accept it on windows

I'll put all the commands needed to reproduce the problem:

	cd D:/annex
	git init
	git annex init \"laptop\"
	git annex upgrade
	git add .
	git commit -a -m \"First\"
	git annex lock
	git annex sync

	cd H:/annex
	git init
	git annex init \"usb\"
	git annex upgrade
	git remote add laptop D:/annex
	git annex sync
