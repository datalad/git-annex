I think I found the problem: <br/>
After I edit the file and commit, if I **lock** the file and **commit again**, the problem won't happen. <br/>
I thought there shouldn't be a difference between committing a locked file and an unlocked file? <br/><br/>
There is another problem too: When you unlock the file, git thinks you changed it. Maybe you could fix this too?
