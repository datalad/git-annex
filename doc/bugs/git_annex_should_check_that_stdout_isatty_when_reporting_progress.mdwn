### Please describe the problem.

git annex reports progress the same when when stdout is a terminal or not.
This is fine when stdout is actually a terminal, but produce lots of annoying characters when stdout is just a regular file.
This is problematic mostly when running git-annex with cron.

### What steps will reproduce the problem?

    git annex copy --to myrepo > log

then look at the content of `log`.

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?

git annex 5.20151019

Mac OS X 10.10.5

Ubuntu 14.04

### Please provide any additional information below.

[[!format sh """
# If you can, paste a complete transcript of the problem occurring here.
# If the problem is with the git-annex assistant, paste in .git/annex/daemon.log


# End of transcript or log.
"""]]

### Have you had any luck using git-annex before? (Sometimes we get tired of reading bug reports all day and a lil' positive end note does wonders)
