When could that be fixed? 

I face the same problem. My repo is only about 2Gb, but it syncs quite slow (like minutes or tens of minutes, but with every smallest change that I want to be synced). I don't want to use other than version 6 and thin to save space, but it takes much time. 

For another repo of 100 thousand files (though 2.6Gb) git-annex commit did not even work (I killed that after about 20 hours of work - it loaded the machine, created a lot of files (twice the size of the repo), but did not stop in that time).
