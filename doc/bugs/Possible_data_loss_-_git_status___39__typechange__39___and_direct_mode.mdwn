#### What steps will reproduce the problem?

When moving to direct mode files get flagged in git as 'typechange'.

    md test-directmode; cd test-directmode ; git init; git annex init
    date > test.file ; git annex add test.file
    git commit -m "Initial commit"
    git status   # All fine
    git annex direct
    git status   # typechange: test.file
    git add test.file && git commit -m "looks like I should commit this"
    # And the symlink is now broken...

#### What is the expected output? What do you see instead?

Surprised to see the typechange status in git.  Would not expect to see anything, however, if you `git add` and then commit you can get data loss.  :-(


#### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?

git-annex version: 3.20130114

OS: OSX 10.6.8
