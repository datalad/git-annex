git-annex actually has very similar behavior to git. Consider from your example:

	joey@darkstar:~/tmp/xx/git-annex-link>git annex get link-to-level1/file
	error: pathspec 'link-to-level1/file' did not match any file(s) known to git
	Did you forget to 'git add'?
	get: 1 failed
	
Compare to:

	joey@darkstar:~/tmp/xx/git-annex-link>git rm link-to-level1/file
	fatal: pathspec 'link-to-level1/file' did not match any files

If anything, it seems that the bug is in `git-annex info` for behaving 
differently in this case when run on a file behind a symlink.

Also this is not a problem if you `cd` to the symlink and then run commands
operating on relative files.
