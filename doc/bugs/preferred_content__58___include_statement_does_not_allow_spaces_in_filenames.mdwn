### Please describe the problem.
Filenames for the *include* statement for [preferred content](http://git-annex.branchable.com/preferred_content/) can not contain spaces.

### What steps will reproduce the problem?

* Create an annex repo
* Run `git annex vicfg`
* Enter expression *include='pictures/dir with spaces'*
* git annex complains: # ** Parse error in next line: Parse failure: near "with" Parse failure: near "spaces'"

(The *'* is interpreted as part of the filepath.)

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?

I am using the current binaries from Debian stable amd64.

### Please provide any additional information below.

The only workaround I found is to use a glob for the filepath which only works for the first space: *include='pictures/dir\*'*.
