### Please describe the problem.
I get this same internal server error when doing the encrypted rsync repo option:

    user error (gpg ["--quiet","--trust-model","always","--gen-random","--armor","1","512"] exited 2)

### What steps will reproduce the problem?

1. click Configuration > repositories
2. click Remote Server
3. On "Ready to add remote server" screen click Use an encrypted repo

Error pops up:

Internal Server Error

    user error (gpg ["--quiet","--trust-model","always","--gen-random","--armor","1","512"] exited 2)

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?

Using MacOS 10.7.5 Lion

[[!meta title="OSX gpg.conf auto-key-locate cert line breaks gpg in git-annex app"]]
