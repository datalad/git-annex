Update: I've just tried to add a 'test' directory to the repository with only a 'foo' file inside, then git commit. Surprisingly, if I do 'git annex fsck .' of it, the repository is marked as **dead** and no known copies of foo are available:

    (master)> mkdir test ; cd test
    test (master) > cat > foo
    bar
    test (master)> git annex add .
    add foo ok
    (recording state in git...)
    test (master)> git commit -m \"added fake content to test git annex repo\"
    [master b9f0a8f] added fake content to test git annex repo
     1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
     create mode 120000 events/2015/test/foo
    test (master)> git annex fsck .
    Warning: Fscking a repository that is currently marked as dead.
    fsck foo (checksum...) 
      ** No known copies exist of foo
    failed
    (recording state in git...)
    git-annex: fsck: 1 failed

At this point, I suspect that the repository on my laptop has some serious problem. Shall I move this discussion to the forum? It may be a git-annex bug but it can just be that the repository is damaged for other reasons. Moreover, what is the best course of action, at this point?
