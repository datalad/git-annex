Given that the repository is marked as dead, I tried to bring it back with 'git-annex semitrust laptop' - 'laptop' being the name of the git annex repository on my laptop. Apparently, this action solved the problem. Fsck now works as expected, and I could sync and get the new files on the clone on the external hard disk as usual.

Now, if this the correct solution to my problem, I am wondering how it is possible that the repository was marked as dead. I carefully checked the history of previous command, but no sign of 'git annex dead' o similar. Are there scenarios where a repository is automatically marked as dead?
