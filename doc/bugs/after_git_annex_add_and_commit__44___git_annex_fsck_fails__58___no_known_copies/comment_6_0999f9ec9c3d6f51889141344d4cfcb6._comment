Ok, the repository being dead certianly explains why fsck found a problem.

It may be that fsck should have a better message in this case. Like
"only dead repository had copies of the file".

Repositories are only ever marked dead on user request. There are a few
ways besides `git annex dead` that you could have done it. Perhaps trying
to delete the repo in the webapp, or changing it in `git annex vicfg`.
You can check out the git-annex branch and examine the history of the 
trust.log file to see when it was changed to dead.
