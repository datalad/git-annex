The chicken and egg problem could be solved by making `git-annex push`,
after pushing the git branches, regenerate the remote list. So if the
branch push created the git repo, any annex uuid that the new repo has
would be discovered at that point.

The remote list regeneration would only need to be done when there are
git remotes that don't have a UUID yet.

The assistant would also need to be made to do that.

This, combined with avoiding prompting on 404 in 
UUID discovery would make "push to create" work smoothly.
