The chicken and egg problem could be solved by making `git-annex push`,
after pushing the git branches, regenerate the remote list. So if the
branch push created the git repo, any annex uuid that the new repo has
would be discovered at that point.

The remote list regeneration would only need to be done when there are
git remotes that don't have a UUID yet.

The assistant would also need to be made to do that.

This, combined with avoiding the early 
UUID discovery that led to the git-credential prompt, would make
"push to create" work smoothly.
