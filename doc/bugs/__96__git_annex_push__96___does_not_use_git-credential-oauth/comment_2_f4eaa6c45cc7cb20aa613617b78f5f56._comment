If the server sent back 404 for the /config hit, then the early UUID
discovery would not prompt with git credential.

Then, to make "push to create" work smoothly, `git-annex push`, 
after pushing the git branches, could regenerate the remote list. So if
the branch push created the git repo, any annex uuid that the new repo
has would be discovered at that point.

The remote list regeneration would only need to be done when there are
git remotes that don't have a UUID yet.

The assistant would also need to be made to do that.
