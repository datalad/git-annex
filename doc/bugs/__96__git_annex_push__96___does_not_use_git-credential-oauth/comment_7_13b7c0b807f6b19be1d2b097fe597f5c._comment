The www-authenticate header is also sent when the request for `/config` is
a 401. So git-annex can use that to set the wwwauth field.

The capability fields are indicating capabilities of git.
I checked and git-credential-oauth does not rely on those capabilities.

(Wildly, git-credential-oauth is looking for "GitLab", "GitHub", and
"Gitea" in order to sniff what backend it's authenticating to, and that's
all it uses the wwwauth for.)
