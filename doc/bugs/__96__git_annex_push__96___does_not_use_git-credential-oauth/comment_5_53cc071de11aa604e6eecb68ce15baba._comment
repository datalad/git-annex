`git push` seems to first make a GET request for something like `/m.risse/test-push-oauth2.git/info/refs?service=git-receive-pack`, which responds with a 401 and `www-authenticate: Basic realm=\"Gitea\"` among the headers. Git then seems to pass this information on to the git-credential-helper.

`git annex push` likewise receives a 401 response from the `/config` endpoint with the same www-authenticate header, so it could pass it on to the credential helper too.

I am not sure where the `capability`s are coming from...
