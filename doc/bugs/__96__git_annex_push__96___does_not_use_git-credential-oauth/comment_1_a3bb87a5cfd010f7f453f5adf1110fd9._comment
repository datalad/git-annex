git-annex is actually using git credential here. That's
where the "Username for" prompt comes from.

Looks like the url you gave 404's. But git-annex is hitting
`https://atris.fz-juelich.de/m.risse/test1.git/config` and getting a 401
Unauthorized for that. Which is why it is using git credential. 
But I'm not sure if I'm seeing now the same now as what you would have seen.

@matrs Any chance you could give me access to reproduce this using your
server so I could look into that?
