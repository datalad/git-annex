git-annex is actually using git credential here. That's
where the "Username for" prompt comes from.

I think that this is a chicken and egg problem. git-annex is doing UUID
discovery, which is the first thing it does when run with a new remote that
does not have a UUID. But the repository does not exist, so has no UUID,
and it won't be created until git push happens.

Deferring git-annex UUID discovery would avoid the problem, but I think
that would be very complicated if possible at all.

I wonder if there is some way that git-annex could tell, at the http level,
that this URL does not exist yet? If so, it could avoid doing UUID
discovery. Then `git-annex push` would at least be able to push the git
repo. And then on the next run git-annex would discover the UUID and would
be able to fully use the repository. Not an ideal solution perhaps, since
you would need to `git-annex push` twice in a row to fully populate the
repisitory.

Looks like the url you gave just 404's, but I'm not sure if I'm seeing
now the same as what you would have seen.

@matrs Any chance you could give me access to reproduce this using your
server so I could look into that?
