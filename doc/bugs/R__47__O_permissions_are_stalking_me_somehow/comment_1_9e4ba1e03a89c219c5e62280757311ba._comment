A file's permissions cannot prevent it being renamed; so I diagnose some
kind of directory permission problem.

(Also AFAICS git-annex add deals with files whose permissions don't allow
being read by turning on the read bit. And it should never need the write
bit. I can `chmod 000 foo; git annex add foo` and it succeeds..)
