### Please describe the problem.

When `annex.autocommit` is set to `false`, the assistant continues to commit to the repository, at least in indirect mode (direct mode not tested). I'd like it to not even `git annex add`, but it should at least not `git commit`.

### What steps will reproduce the problem?

I started the assistant with `git annex assistant`. Then I also opened the webapp with `git annex website`.

Next, I ran `git config --bool --local --replace-all annex.autocommit false`. Supposedly that'll stop the assistant from committing things.

Then I did a `echo "hello world" > test`.

The webapp showed the file syncing, and `ls -l test` confirmed it'd been added the annex. `git status` confirmed it'd been committed as well.

I did a `git rm test`, and then a `git status`... and it turns out the annex committed that as well.

NOTE: My repository is in indirect mode.

I tried `--global` instead of `--local` for the config, and that didn't make a difference.
