Done.

I've added a followup patch that makes blake3 into a build flag. I'm
happy to roll with that for now, if that gets code merged. I'm not
particularly satisfied by the existing BLAKE3 libraries for Haskell,
so I might opt to roll a nicer one with proper parallelism when I have
some time to spare.

It appears that some flags switch between a vendored library copy and
an external dependency (namely, the git-lfs flag), maybe that's an
alternative option for the interim?
