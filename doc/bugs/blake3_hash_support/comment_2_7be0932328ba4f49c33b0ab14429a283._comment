Thanks for the patch.

I do think it would make sense to include "256" in the name of the backend,
unless BLAKE3 recommends against using other lengths for some good reason.

As for accepting this patch, the added dependency makes it harder. This
would require distributions like Debian add the blake3 package. If
cryptonite included it, that would be much easier -- though it would still 
need ifdefs to support the old versions of crytonite for some time.

Going the current route with adding a blake3 depdenency would need to start
with it as a build flag..
