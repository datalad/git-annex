### Please describe the problem.

Originally reported against datalad [#4976](https://github.com/datalad/datalad/issues/4976). Ran into it again and decided to reproduce by simply trying to make `git config` in parallel (they should not crash, right?) and it brings to the same problem reported

```shell
#!/bin/bash

set -eu
export PS4='> '
set -x
cd "$(mktemp -d ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/dl-XXXXXXX)"

which git
grep runshell `which git`

git init
git annex init

for s in {1..30}; do
    git config annex.version &
done
wait

``` 

I also wonder if it is possible to avoid dealing with locales upon **every** invocation of git/git-annex? couldn't it be done just once e.g. per installed annex? (sorry if we had this discussion already, but it feels not yet resolved optimally).

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?

`8.20200908-gcfc74c2f4`
