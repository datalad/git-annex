##What steps will reproduce the problem?

    echo text > foo
    echo text > bar
    git annex add foo bar
    git annex unannex foo

##What is the expected output? What do you see instead?

I would expect that the object behind 'bar' remained intact, what happens is that the object is moved out of the annex and 'bar' is left as a dangling symlink, if you are unlucky and don't spot this, it could be potentially dangerous, since you can easily lose data.

##What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?

git-annex built from git on Tue Mar 12 15:58:36 2013 -0400
