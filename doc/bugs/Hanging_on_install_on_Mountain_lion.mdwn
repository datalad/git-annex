### Please describe the problem.

In trying to install git-annex on my mac OSX Mountain Lion, the program is hanging when I open the program.

### What steps will reproduce the problem?

Open the DMG, drag the app to applications folder, double-click on the application. Web browser opens with a localhost url. The webpage says "Starting webapp..." and doesn't go anywhere. Initialization seems to fail and I need to force quit the application.

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?

I'm not totally sure (since it hangs and I can't check a version number, but since I just downloaded it now and the homepage says the latest version is "version 4.20130621" which was released 2 days and 13 hours ago, I assume that is it. 

I'm using OSX 10.8.4.


### Please provide any additional information below.
