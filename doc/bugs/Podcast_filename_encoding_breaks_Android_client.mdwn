### Please describe the problem.

Imported podcast files with iso-8859-1 encoding and swedish
characters break repo on Android client with errors like.

``error: unable to create file pod/Pennypodden___om_bostadspolitik/E54___�se_Richard__Gr�nby_.mp3 (Invalid argument)``

Android clients empty direct repo is then distributed to all clients. Whole
annex repo appears empty on all clients. Old revision has to be checked out to
get files back. As soon as Android client syncs again however, all repos are
emptied.

### What steps will reproduce the problem?
Set up indirect repo on linux laptop and direct repo on Android phone. On the
laptop do:

``git-annex importfeed http://www.pennygangen.se/podcast/podcast.xml``

Wait for changes to propagate if using the assistant or sync manually.

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?

 - Debian sid and testing with 5.20141125 on various clients and 
 - Android 4.4 with 5.20150219-gd24cfd3 on the phone.

### Please provide any additional information below.

After failing to write the files with problematic filenames git annex appears
to belive it should commit the fact that the repo is empty and sync this
emptiness to everyone.

``convmv -f iso-8859-1 -t utf8 $problemfile --notest`` on the laptop fixes the
filenames and the Android client stops wrecking everything.
