What steps will reproduce the problem?

Unsure. I believe:

* Add a git remote
* Mark it as dead
* Remove the git remote, re-add with the same name

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?

When I do a `git annex status` I see:

 	04e701b5-8a22-4391-ad74-d75dde715c7b -- bigserver
 	6ddfda5d-0f17-45a9-b41a-2a626a823101 -- bigserver

What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?

4.20130323 on OSX and Linux

Please provide any additional information below.

Trying to get a file from bigserver kept on failing with the message "Try making some of these repositories available". Which led me on a wild goose chases blaming SSH keys and PATH issues.
