I don't know why git is repeatedly smudging the empty file.
(I was able to reproduce it.)

git-annex does not treat an empty file any differently than any other file.
It seems that this is probably a bug in git.

Note that v6 git repos are known to be innefficient due to git's smudge
interface not being very good. This is why they are not yet used by
default.
