Copying the `git-annex.exe` does work but you can also create a symlink and tell Windows to execute symlinks by doing the following.

On the remote machine (the one you are connecting to)

## Create a symlink:

    mklink \"C:\Program Files (x86)\Git\bin\git-annex-shell\" \"C:\Program Files (x86)\Git\bin\git-annex.exe\"

## Tell Windows to run files with no extension:

* Open Environment Variables
* At the end of `PATHEXT` add `;.`

## A problem with rsync

Unfortunately I now get `Access is denied` and `rsync: connection unexpectedly closed`. I think this is due to path issues on Windows. Trying rsync manually I need to use the `/cygdrive/c/rest/of/path` syntax otherwise I get `No such file or directory.`
