### Please describe the problem.

Downloaded git-annex (version for android 5.0) from the website. Upon opening the app for the first time and setting up a repository at /sdcard/annex, the terminal gave out the error.

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?

Nexus 4 running Cyanogenmod 12.1 (Android 5.1) build 20151007 and 20150901

### Please provide any additional information below.
Output to the terminal window:
[[!format sh """

I can add remote repositories and they show up nicely in the webapp, but no files are ever downloaded.

### Have you had any luck using git-annex before? (Sometimes we get tired of reading bug reports all day and a lil' positive end note does wonders)

I have a couple of repositories atm, one with my music, another that backs up our family pictures for the family and uses Amazon S3 as a backup.
