Same problem here: on my synology NAS I'm stuck at git-annex version 6.20161212  (later releases fail to run) and I recently (blindly) updated git-annex on my macbook with homebrew to 10.20220624 (I don't remember what previous version was installed).

Because upgrading git-annex at the NAS-side is not an option at the moment, I had to downgrade git-annex locally to 8.20211011. This was quite a challenge unfortunately, and I documented it [on my blog](https://www.stefaanlippens.net/git-annex-homebrew-version-woes.html) (in case anybody else might face the same uphill battle)
