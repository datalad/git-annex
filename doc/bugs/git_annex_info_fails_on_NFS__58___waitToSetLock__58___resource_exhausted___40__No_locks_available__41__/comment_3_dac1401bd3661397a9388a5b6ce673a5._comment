Seems unlikely that the init-time check would not have worked in this
repository. Probably the repository was either initialized by an old
version of git-annex, or perhaps init was run on the NFS server,
or perhaps the repository was initted elsewhere and moved into place.

I don't want to complicate locking with fallbacks involving changing
configuration. ENOLCK can be raised for other reasons, so it's not
necessarily an indication of a NFS system anyway.
