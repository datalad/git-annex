### Please describe the problem.

I have found various `.tmp` files in a directory in which I performed various `git annex import` that failed because the destination disk was full.

These files should be removed when import detects that its has no more space to proceed and exists.

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?

git-annex 5.20140517.4 in Ubuntu 12.04.
