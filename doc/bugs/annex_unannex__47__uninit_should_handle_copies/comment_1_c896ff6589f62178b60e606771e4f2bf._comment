You convince me for unannex, but isn't the goal of uninit to revert all annex operations? In the current state, a clean revert is not possible (because of the broken symlinks after uninit). Instead of copying, using hard links is out of question?

For my needs, is the command \"git annex unlock .\" (from the root of the repo) a correct workaround?
