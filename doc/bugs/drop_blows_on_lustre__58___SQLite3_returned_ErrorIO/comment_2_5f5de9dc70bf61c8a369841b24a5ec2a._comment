It's now possible to set annex.dbdir to a directory on some other
filesystem than one containing the repository, where sqlite works better.

Unsure yet if it would be safe to set annex.dbdir to a local directory,
and have the git-annex repository on a networked filesystem that is
accessed from multiple clients. Each client will have its own set of sqlite
databases, and will maintain them as best it can.
