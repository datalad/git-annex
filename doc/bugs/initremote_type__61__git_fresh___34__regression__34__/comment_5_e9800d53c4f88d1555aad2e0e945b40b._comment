Aha! That funky remote.log was caused by a historical bad type in 
git-annex: UUID has a NoUUID value, and when it probed for the UUID, it
did not check if it got NoUUID, which serializes to "". Really fixing that
is hard, I've tried a couple of times. 

Anyway, the new behavior is not buggy, so closing.
