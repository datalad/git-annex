### Please describe the problem.

Exporting to a directory remote with exporttree=yes works if the source repository is not on an adjusted branch.


If, before the export, git annex adjust is invoked with --unlock or --lock (the only two I tested) the new files are not copied.

FWIW, annex.adjustedbranchrefresh is set true.

### What steps will reproduce the problem?

git annex export --json-progress --to export-special-remote main:Music

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?

on Linux

# End of transcript or log.

### Have you had any luck using git-annex before? (Sometimes we get tired of reading bug reports all day and a lil' positive end note does wonders)

Yes, I am developing the easy-git-annex interface.
