Thinking about this over the weekend, I had two ideas:

* The worker pool has an AnnexState for each thread. If those could be
  partitioned so eg perfom stage is always run by the same threads,
  then when only one stage needs cat-file, the overall number of cat-file
  processes would be reduced by 1/3rd.

  This might be the least resource intensive approach. But, as threads
  transition between stages, their AnnexState necessarily does too,
  and the cleanup stage might need some state change made in the perform
  stage, so swapping out the perform AnnexState for a cleanup one
  seems hard to accomplish.

* Could have a pool of cat-files, and just have worker threads block until
  one is available. This would let it be pinned to the -J number, or
  event to a smaller number.

  Seems likely that only 2 or 3 in the cat-file pool will
  maximise concurrency, because it's not a major bottleneck most of the
  time, and when it is the actual bottleneck is probably disk IO and so
  won't be helped by more (and likely more only increase unncessary seeks).
