This is due to lookupkey passing each filename through `git ls-files`
in order to support absolute filepaths input. See 
[[!commit cfdfe4df6c8b3fe46bbc7afcc8274237a5b2ce2a]]

Made it only do that for absolute paths, which should make it at least
marginally faster than git-annex find. I would not expect it to be much
faster though, because git-annex find displaying a little more information
takes negligible CPU time really.
