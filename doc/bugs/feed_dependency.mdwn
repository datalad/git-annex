It looks like the latest version of `git-annex` currently published on
Hackage has a dependency on `feed` package without an upper bound
specified.

FYI, as per https://github.com/bergmark/feed/pull/20, a new version of
`feed` will be released soon, incorporating non-backwards compatible
changes to `feed` interface (`String` was replaced with `Text`
throughout and `xml-types` types were adopted). Changes are largely
mechanical but you'll probably want to ensure that future version of
`git-annex` can build with newer `feed`.

To prevent breakage for users, you may want to release a new version
of `git-annex` with an upper bound specified now, then push a version
compatible with `feed-1.0` after that comes out later.
