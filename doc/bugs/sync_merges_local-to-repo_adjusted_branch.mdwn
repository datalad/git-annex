Given that repo1 and repo2 both have a branch adjusted/master(hidemissing), those branches should be local to the repo as they contain the files available locally.  Yet, when doing a sync between the two repositories, the branches are forcefully merged which is wrong.

    $ git annex sync
    commit (recording state in git...)
    On branch master
    nothing to commit, working tree clean
    ok
