### Please describe the problem.

extra-deps in stack.yaml seems to miss a few packages? I am pretty new to stack, so maybe
I am misinterpreting, but following stacks suggestion below and adding 

- bloomfilter-2.0.1.0
- network-multicast-0.2.0
- torrent-10000.0.1

to my stack.yaml lets me build the latest master branch on jessie.

### What steps will reproduce the problem?

Checking out the latest commit (661dae3649f10a07ba6091a9a376ae1049fed716) and running "stack setup && stack install"
should reproduce it? See transcript below.

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?

6.20170101-android on Debian Jessie. Stack Version 1.3.2


### Please provide any additional information below.

### Have you had any luck using git-annex before? (Sometimes we get tired of reading bug reports all day and a lil' positive end note does wonders)

Yes, I am using it since a few years to manage my videos, photos and music. Thanks so much for this outstanding piece of software!
