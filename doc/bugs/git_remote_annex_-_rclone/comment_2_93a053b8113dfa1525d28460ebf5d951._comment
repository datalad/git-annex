About using rclone with git-remote-annex, I wonder how practical it will
be, since rclone does need its own configuration. To clone from it you will
need to have rclone configured already, it seems.

If the rclone special remote could include the complete rclone
configuration in its configuration, it would be possible to make a
git-remote-annex url that could be cloned with no additional configuration.
