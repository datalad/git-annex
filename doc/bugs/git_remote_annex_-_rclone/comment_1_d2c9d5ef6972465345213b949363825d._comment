I got this protocol level dump:

	[2024-10-19 16:59:54.229607011] (Annex.ExternalAddonProcess) /home/joey/bin/rclone[1] <-- CHECKPRESENT GITMANIFEST--1eb4e389-9aea-4968-a947-498fd52645e0
	[2024-10-19 16:59:54.230079229] (Annex.ExternalAddonProcess) /home/joey/bin/rclone[1] --> CHECKPRESENT-FAILURE GITMANIFEST--1eb4e389-9aea-4968-a947-498fd52645e0

That protocol looks fine, problem is parseKeyVariety does not have a parser for the
GITMANIFEST key type. Once I added that, it got to a different failure that
looked due to my lack of setup of rclone, presumably it would work with a
properly setup rclone.

I think this probably affects using any special remote with git-remote-annex.
This is still a fairly new and not much used feature, and I may not have tested
it with external special remotes when developing it.

Re your questions, git-remote-annex doesn't care about the details of how
the special remote is configured, it's up to you to provide an url that
provides all necessary configuration options for the special remote,
whatever those are. Spaces in a path should work if properly url-encoded.
