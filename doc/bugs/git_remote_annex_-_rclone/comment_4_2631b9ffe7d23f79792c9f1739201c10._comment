I just tried it out, something like this works without any further rclone configuration: `git annex initremote icg1220-remote-dir type=rclone encryption=none rcloneremotename=':sftp,host=icg1220' rcloneprefix=remote-dir`. It just prints some log messages from rclone that it can't save config settings for this on the fly backend, but those seem to be purely informational.
