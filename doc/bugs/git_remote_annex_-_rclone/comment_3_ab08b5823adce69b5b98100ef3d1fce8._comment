Rclone has something called \"connection strings\" (<https://rclone.org/docs/#connection-strings>), which can make a separate rclone configuration unnecessary. E.g. you can use `rclone ls :sftp,host=hostname:path/to/dir` to `ls` a sftp remote without first setting it up in the config.

It might be possible to set such a connection string as the remote name in the special remote to avoid a separate rclone config, but I haven't actually tried it out.
