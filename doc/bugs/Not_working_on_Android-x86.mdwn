### Please describe the problem.

git-annex doesn't start on [Android-x86](http://www.android-x86.org) in VirtualBox (version 4.1.18-dfsg-2+deb7u1).

On Android 4.2.2 (android-x86-4.2-20130228.iso) it starts the terminal which prints nothing but `[Terminal session finished]`.
On Android 4.3 (android-x86-4.3-20130725.iso) it starts the terminal and prints:

    In mgmain JNI_OnLoad
    
    [Terminal session finished]

The browser/webapp is never started.

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?

Version 1.0.52 for Android. I made sure to install the correct APK files for each version of Android.
