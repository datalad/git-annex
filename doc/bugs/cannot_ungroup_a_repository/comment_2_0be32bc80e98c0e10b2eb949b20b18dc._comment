I'm sorry to say that the error went away after attaching a strace to it:

```
anarcat@angela:video$ strace -o log -e execve git annex ungroup . transfer
ungroup . ok
(recording state in git...)
```

no idea wtf happened here, but i guess we can call this [[done]]? next time i'll try strace, sorry, i should have thought of it the first time.
