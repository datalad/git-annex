Simultaneously, a new command `git annex assist` has been added that does basically a single step of the assistant, so roughly `git annex add;git add -A;git annex sync --content`. That goes into the direction of your `fullsync` suggestion.

You can read more about the reasoning for `git annex sync` syncing content by default [here](https://git-annex.branchable.com/todo/Having___39__git_annex_sync__39___optionally_add/#comment-fc813a22c713490156234567ed211277), where I suggested to add a config to `git annex sync` that would optionally add new files as well. That turned out to launch an avalanche of new commands and changes (git annex pull, git annex push, git annex assist, sync syncing conent, etc.). ðŸ˜…

IIUC, Joeys reasoning is that `git annex sync` was incomplete/inconsistent from the start and did too many configurable things. `git annex assist` syncs the entire repo state - as the assistant. Preferred content expressions can be used to specify what files a repo wants. If you set that to `git annex wanted REPO present`, a content sync won't affect it anyway. I still think that a configurable default preferred content expression for new repos is very important, now that syncinc content by default might get the default: https://git-annex.branchable.com/todo/Setting_default_preferred_content_expressions/
