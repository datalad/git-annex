Frankly, as a fellow user of \"incomplete annexes\" I also find it rather jarring that having gotten used to git committing my own changes
on the command line and not relying on mere `sync` to do that (or the assistant -- I haven't found a use
for the assistant yet) but then also preferring to use invocations of `git annex sync --no-commit` (which I've abbreviated to
`git annex-sync` by way of a git alias) rather freely to record my git-level changes across remotes,
I would from here on out be forced to add the `-g` flag to all my invocations just to make sure that I don't get
an annoying warning or my then current repo doesn't cause possibly huge content to flow across the remotes because I haven't
remembered to set `annex.synccontent` appropriately. I know the ideal is to have preferred content settings
for all annexes but not every git-annex user have an innate sense of all the intricacies involved in doing that
and for them to be forced to do so is a bit too much, in my humble opinion.

@Joey, I have a suggestion: instead of breaking the UX of `sync`, why not do that on a lesser used command `mirror` and change it
to sync git-level data in addition to files (ie. I suggest that `mirror` could be a better/shorter name for OP's `fullsync`).
Then add a flag called `--only-content` to `mirror` to restore its old behavior. I bet that would have a smaller impact on git-annex's
users than making us count our blessings with `-g`s and all.
