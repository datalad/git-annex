Changing the default preferred content expression to `present` rather than
`anything` would affect other things like `get --auto` and the assistant. I
don't think that is a good idea.

My idea in comment #15 is a special case for sync and not a wider change.

It will have a special case either way. The current special case means
that users who have set preferred content need to remember to use `sync
--content`. The new special case will only manifest as a difference in
behavior between `sync` and `sync --content` (and `get --auto` etc)
for users with no preferred content configured.

I do think that's a valuable narrowing of the special case.

Gone ahead and changed the warning.
