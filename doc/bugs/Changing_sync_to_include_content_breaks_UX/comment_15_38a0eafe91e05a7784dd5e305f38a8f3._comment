My current thinking is that when a repository does not have a preferred
content expression, a content sync could avoid adding content to it. 

This would avoid surprising behavior after the transition, except for 
repositories that did at some time have a preferred content expression set,
but one that no longer reflects the use of the repository.

However, current users of `sync --content` (or of annex.synccontent) do
expect it to fill their repositories that don't have preferred content
configured. So would a sync that defaults to content syncing then need to
behave differently than an explicit `sync --content`? Or should changing
behavior in that case also be part of the transition?
