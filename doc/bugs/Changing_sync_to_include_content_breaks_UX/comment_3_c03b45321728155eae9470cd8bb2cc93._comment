> IIUC, Joeys reasoning is that git annex sync was incomplete/inconsistent from the start and did too many configurable things.

That's not a reason to break backwards compatibility for such a prominent command as `sync`. Just no.

> git annex assist syncs the entire repo state - as the assistant.

I don't want to use the assistant -- or it's CLI alter ego assist -- I want my own manicured commit messages, puh-lease! The assistant
is a whole another use case, just not mine at the moment.

Just give us our old `sync` back. Rename it to `synk` (or, `sc`/`sk` -- as in \"sync for [k]urmudgeons\") if you want but let us have it. :)
