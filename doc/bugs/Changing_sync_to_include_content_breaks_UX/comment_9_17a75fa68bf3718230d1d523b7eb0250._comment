Fine with me to keep `git annex sync` at its old behaviour. I'm happy about `assist|push|pull` and would also be happy with a `metasync`.

These are all decisions that joey will have to decide himself. He has written this amazing piece of software that I'll be forever grateful for (Thanks joey!!). If he decides that `git annex sync` syncs content, so be it.

Your idea with moving the content-syncing into `init` sounds reasonable from a backwards-compatibility point of view. But I doubt joey will want to make `init` (or any other command) accumulate patchy stuff.
