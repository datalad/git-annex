Please don't engage in unwarranted speculation about strange desires of mine
to eliminate features that are crucial to git-annex. In general, avoid
inflammatory language on this website. Thank you.

It's important that git-annex be able to make changes that make it better.
Backwards compatability is not everything. Improvements can make git-annex
more cohesive and easier to understand for new users.
This kind of pre-warned transition is commonly used by git when making
similarly impactful changes.

annex.synccontent can be set in your global git config. It can also be set
with `git-annex config` which will affect all clones of that repo. This
will be a minor amount of work for most users to deal with.

BTW, this transition plan actually started 6 years ago when I added
annex.syncontent configuration and --no-content.

As you note, it's important that's already available in all commonly used
old versions of git-annex.
