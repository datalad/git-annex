## What steps will reproduce the problem?

I attempt

      cabal install git-annex

(already having installed `c2hs`)

## What is the expected output? What do you see instead?

I get

        $ cabal install git-annex
        Resolving dependencies...
        cabal: Could not resolve dependencies:
