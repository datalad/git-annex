I've disabled the subdir option (git annex enableremote borg subdir=) and that seems to solve the issue. That is weird, because the subdir is included in the borg repository. Hmm...

[[!format sh \"\"\"
$ LANG=C git annex sync borg 
commit  
On branch main
nothing to commit, working tree clean
ok
list borg ok
(recording state in git...)
\"\"\"]]
