I think that "list borg failed" does indicate there is some real failure
involving borg, but it seems it's not as simple as a command that fails.

I wonder if this might be caused by your locale settings. git-annex does
run `borg list` with LANG=C, but there might be some other locale setting
that is breaking it.

But... I'm having difficulty seeing how git-annex could fail like that without
displaying an error message at all.
