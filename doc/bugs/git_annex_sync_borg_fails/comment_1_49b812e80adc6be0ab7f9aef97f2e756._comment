It would be very helpful to know what command is exiting nonzero. Here's
how to find out.

Fist, find the line showing the ExitFailure:

	[2024-05-23 22:39:41.016177898] (Utility.Process) process [57493] done ExitFailure 1

Then look above that point in the debug log to find the process with the
same number. In the example above, it is 57493. This will show what command
was run.

Also, it seems to me that git-annex would usually output some kind of error
message if something failed during a sync, and you've omitted the git-annex
output. It would be helpful to see that too.
