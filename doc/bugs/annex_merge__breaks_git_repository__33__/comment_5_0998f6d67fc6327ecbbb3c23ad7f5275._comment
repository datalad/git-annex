performTransitionsLocked, when `neednewlocalbranch = True`,
first writes the new git-annex branch, and then calls
regraftexports which adds a second commit onto it.

In the window before regraftexports finishes, interrupting git-annex will
leave the repository in this state.

There may be some other way this could happen, but that seems like a likely
cause. It needs to avoid updating the git-annex branch ref until it's
grafted the exports into it.
