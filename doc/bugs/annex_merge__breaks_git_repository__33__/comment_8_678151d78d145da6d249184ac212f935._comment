Fixed performTransitionsLocked to create the new git-annex branch
atomically.

Found another way this could happen, interrupting `git-annex export` after
it writes export.log but before it grafts the tree into the git-annex
branch. Fixed that one too.

So hopefully this won't happen to any more repositories with these fixes.
Still leaves the question of how to recover from the problem.
