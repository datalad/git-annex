Spotchecked a few other OpenNeuro datasets in the same numeric range and
they seem ok, so this may have been a 1-off problem. It would be good to
check all 1.1k datasets.

One possible way this might happen: git-annex is performing a transition,
and gets interrupted after making the commit starting the new git-annex
branch, but before it can graft in the export trees.
