Occurs to me that one way to get a repository into this situation would be
to do a `git-annex export`, then `git-annex forget`, and then manually
reset the git-annex branch to `git-annex^^` (or similarly push
`git-annex^^` to origin).

There is a commit after the transition commit that re-grafts the exported
tree back into the git-annex branch, and a manual reset would cause exactly
this situation.

I doubt OpenNeuro is manually resetting the git-annex branch when creating
these repos, but stranger things have happened...
