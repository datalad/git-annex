While I don't think this affects the ds002144 repository
(because the repository with the missing tree is dead), here's what happens
if the export.log's tree is missing, master has been reset to a previous tree,
which was exported earlier, and in a clone we try to get a file that is present
in both trees from the remote:

	get foo (from d...) fatal: bad object f4815823941716de0f0fdf85e8aaba98d024d488
	
	  unknown export location

Note that the "bad object" message only appears the first time run.
Afterwards it only says "unknown export location".

Even if the tree object later somehow gets pulled in, it will keep failing,
because the exportdb at this point contains the tree sha and it won't try
to update from it again.

To recover from this situation, the user can make a change to
the tree (eg add a file), and export. It will complain one last time about
the bad object, and then the export.log gets fixed to contain an available
tree. However, any files that were in the missing tree that do not get
overwritten by that export will remain in the remote, without git-annex
knowing about them. If the remote has importtree=yes, importing from it
is another way to recover.
