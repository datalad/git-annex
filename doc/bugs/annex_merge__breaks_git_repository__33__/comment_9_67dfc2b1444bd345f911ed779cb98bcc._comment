Note that at least in the case of ds002144, its git-annex branch does not
contain grafts of the missing trees. The grafts only get created in the
clone when dealing with a transition.

So, it seems that to recover from the problem, at least in the case of this
repository, it will be sufficient for git-annex to avoid regrafting trees
if the object is missing.

Done that, and so I suppose this bug can be closed. I'd be more satified if
I knew how this repository was produced though.
