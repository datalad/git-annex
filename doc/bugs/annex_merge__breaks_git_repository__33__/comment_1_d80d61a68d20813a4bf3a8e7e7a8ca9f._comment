Reproduction recipe works, thanks!

Happens back to 10.20240129 at least, this is not recent breakage.

There are some interesting things in the git-annex history.
Including some git-annex:export.tree grafting, and also
a continued transition.

I made a new empty repo, initialized and annexed some files. Running the
same script but cloning that, this problem does not occur. I also tried
exporting a tree in that repo, and still the problem doesn't occur. I even
tried running `git-annex forget` in there and still can't cause the
problem.

So something about this specific repo's git-annex branch history is
triggering the problem and I don't know what. I've archived the current
state of this repo in my big repo as git-annex-test-repos/ds002144.tar.gz
to make sure I can continue to reproduce this.

The first git-annex branch commit that is missing its tree object
is a git-annex:export.tree graft commit. That is 3 commits above
the git-annex branch pulled from github:

Very interesting. Especially since the point of those export.tree graft commits
are to make sure that the exported tree objects are referenced and so don't get
gced out from under us.
