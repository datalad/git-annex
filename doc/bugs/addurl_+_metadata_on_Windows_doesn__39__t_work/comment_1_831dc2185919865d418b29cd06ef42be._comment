Windows is not needed, this will happen in a 
repository where `git annex adjust --unlock` has been run.

A simpler example:

	joey@darkstar:~/tmp/t2#master(unlocked)>git-annex addurl --batch
	http://google.com/
	addurl http://google.com/
	(to google.com_) ok
	^Z
	joey@darkstar:~/tmp/t2#master(unlocked)>git-annex metadata --batch --json
	{"file":"google.com_","fields":{"author":["bar"]}}

I'm not sure if this is a bug, because it's documented to output a blank
line when batch mode is provided a file that is not an annexed file, and
the file is not an annexed file yet due to the pointer not yet having been
staged in git. Which is needed, when in an adjusted unlocked branch, for
git-annex to know that this is an annexed file.

When the file is locked, it just stats the symlink, so the fact that the
symlink is not yet staged in git doesn't matter.

It does not seem to make sense to have addurl update the index
after each file it adds, because that would make addurl of a lot
of files unncessarily slow.

So, I think if anything is changed, it would need to be a change to make
the behavior with unlocked files consistent with the behavior with locked
files. Eg, when the symlink is not yet staged in git, treat it as a
non-annexed file. Which is also consistent with other handling of such
files by git-annex when not in batch mode.

The solution for your program, though, seems like it will be to end the
git-annex addurl process before trying to set metadata on just-added files.
Or, alternatively, to use addurl with --json, extract the key, and set the
metadata of the key.
