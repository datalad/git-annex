Yes, confirmed. I tried to create a new test repository and chmod all directories with +s. I'm using umask 0002, so new files are created with perm 0664 and the correct shared group. But the SQLite files in .git/annex/keys/ are created with permission 0644, so other users in the group are not able to update the files there.
