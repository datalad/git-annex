I was able to reproduce the "origin/git-annex~12:export.tree" part of this
and have fixed that, so it won't show that git-annex branch location,
which is part of git-annex's internal bookkeeping and not something useful
for the command to display.

As to why it is not finding your file, what you show is not necessarily a
bug. If the file `2010-08-21/042.JPG` is not staged in git, it won't be
shown by `git-annex whereused` when run without --historical. It's easy
enough to get into such a situation, for example you could have run a
series of commands like this:

	git-annex add 042.JPG
	mv 042.JPG 2010-08-21/042.JPG
	git commit -a -m foo

If the file is in fact staged in git and whereused doesn't list it,
my next guess would be that somehow it's not getting added to the
associated files database, which is what whereused looks at.
You can check for that with this command:

	sqlite3 .git/annex/keysdb/db 'select * from associated;'| grep SHA256E-s1000013--e435522a9059bcb086b6db5fa5f05a06913266772a7931eefae2b8f7647f5f14.JPG
