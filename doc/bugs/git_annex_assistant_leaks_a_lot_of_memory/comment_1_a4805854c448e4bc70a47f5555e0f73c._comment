Does the assistant's memory use go back to being small when you stop 
and restart the daemon, or does it immediately go back up?

Are there a lot of files in `.git/annex/transfer`? One possibility
is it might be getting flooded with failed/pending file transfers.

If you feel up to building git-annex from source, you could
enable the EKG remote monitoring interface. This would let you see
graphs of the memory use, and probably get a good idea of what's
using memory. Or, you could do a full memory profiling build of
git-annex, which will let us nail down exactly what's using the memory.

See [[this_page|ekg]] for instructions for building git-annex for EKG
and memory profiling. If it's too hard for you to do that, I can 
probably provide you with a prebuilt version with memory profiling.
