This was broken by [[!commit dad4be97c2057db1ef3a13bb983d1701a90c9069]].

For a key of size zero, `addspeculative` adds on a `[]` to the list of chunk
key. But that causes retrieveChunks to think that it's already retrieved
all the chunks, so it avoids doing any retrieval, so the file is not
written. It needs to retrieve the empty key even though it's empty,
so it can decrypt it when it's encrypted; git-annex does not special case
empty file retrieval.

Odd that testremote did not detect this. It does test with empty keys, and
with chunking.
