Ugh, I had closed this as not solvable, but on second thought, it's a very
real wart and if it's not solvable that doesn't make it not a problem.

And it does seem that it could be solved in some outside the box way. 

For example, what if thin files were not hard links to the object file?
Now, they *have* to hard link to somewhere, to prevent git checkout from
deleting the only copy of a thin file. But it could hard link to a
different name in the object directory. One that symlinks do not point to.

Then `git-annex fix` or fsck would need to notice when a symlink points to
an object file that is missing, and copy the thin file to it to populate
it. And, something might also want to reap object files that have become
only used by thin files.
