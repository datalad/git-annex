With a weird crash like this, I was thinking there might be an error message
output to the console. I guess you showed the full console output though.

Was the 85% of system memory happening on Windows or on Linux?

I have no clues how to debug this. If there's useful information anywhere,
it's probably in some windows crash log or system log thing that I know
nothing about.
