I'm afraid I abandoned this patch. It worked, but was still fidgety for being able to ignore parts of the tree. I found another way to do what I wanted by loading an indirect repo into /data and taking advantage of a surprise side effect in how the /sdcard filesystem translated the symlinks from the ext4 filesystem.

I can probably scare it up from my archives, but it hasn't been kept up to date. The good news is (as I recall) the patch was pretty small.
