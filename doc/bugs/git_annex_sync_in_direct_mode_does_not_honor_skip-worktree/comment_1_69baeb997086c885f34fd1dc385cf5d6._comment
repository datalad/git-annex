I'm a little worried about -t being \"semi-deprecated\". I don't know if it would be possible to use either of the other commands the man page suggests to get the info needed by `stageDirect`. (Particularly the Sha of their staged contents.)

All of git-annex's access to the repository tree goes via Git.LsFiles and AFAICS, all the other git commands used there do respect skip-worktree.

I encourage you to work on this, since you're motivated.
