I want to give the two assistants one more try with the newest version.

But I want the assistant not to try a repair once a failure is detected. I want to check the state of the repository to get a clue what goes wrong.
As I understood the code there is no configuration to prevent the repair. Am I wrong? If not I could try to introduce one if it makes sense.
