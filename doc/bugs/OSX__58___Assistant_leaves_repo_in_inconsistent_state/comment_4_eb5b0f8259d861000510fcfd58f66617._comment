I was using the assistant on two machines in parallel and both git repositories got broken. Before that I was just using the command line tools and just one assistant. Today the history got inconsistent when firing up the second assistant.

Repos in use:
- client 1 with active assistant
- client 2 with active assistant
- Synology NAS with git-annex installed (armel-based)

I could recover everything pretty fast by cloning again from the nas device. Copying the .git/config and moving over the .git/annex directory.

I will send you the log-files via mail.
