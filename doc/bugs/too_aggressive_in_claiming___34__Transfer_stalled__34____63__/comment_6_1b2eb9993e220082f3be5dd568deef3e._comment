> "download", where git-annex actually IIRC keeps its monitoring of the file size as it is arriving

git-annex does do file size monitoring
in a few cases (when running `cp`, and when downloading
an url with `curl`), but it does not do it for downloads
in general, and not for external special remotes specifically.

If it did for external special remotes, and if rclone grows the 
destination file as it downloads, rather than atomically at the end
(which I have not verified), that would have avoided this problem.
Probably it will avoids this type of problem for downloads
from the majority of external special remotes. Though of course not for
uploads.

Ok, implemented that for external special remotes.
