Re asymmetric connections, stall detection doesn't need to be
configured anywhere near the total available bandwidth, so generally it
would be ok to configure it for a slow uplink even when a fast downlink is
available. And if you're only interested in detecting total stalls
(as opposed to some kind of "too slow" condition), "1k" per some unit of
time is sufficient.

But maybe it does make sense to be able to configure it to abandon slow
downloads but allow slow uploads. For example, `git-annex get` with
the content on several remotes, where the download speed from one
remote is often fast but occasionally slows down, and another remote
is consistently medium speed.

So you might set "10gb/1m" for downloads from remote, knowing that if it is
slow it will abort the download from it and fall back to the medium speed
remote. But when sending content *to* the variable speed remote, would not
want to give up only because it was a little slow.

Ok, added annex.stalldetection-download, annex.stalldetection-upload, etc.
