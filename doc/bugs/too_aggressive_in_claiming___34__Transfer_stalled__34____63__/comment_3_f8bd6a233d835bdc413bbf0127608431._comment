To reproduce this (more or less), I modified the example.sh external
special remote to sleep for 10 seconds before each key store.
Set up a remote with chunk=1mb, and annex.stalldetection = "0.001mb/1s".

Uploading a 100 mb file, a stall is detected after the first chunk is
uploaded. As expected, since 1 second passed with no update.

When I resume the upload, the second chunk is uploaded and then a stall is
detected on the third. And so on.

I've implemented dynamic granularity scaling now, and in this test case, it notices
it took 11 seconds for the first chunk, and behaves as if it were
configured with annex.stalldetection of "0.022mb/22s". Which keeps it from
detecting a stall.
