I think that what git-annex could do is detect when progress updates are
happening with too low a granularity for the annex.stalldetection
configuration.

When waiting for the first progress update, it can keep track of how much time
has elapsed. If annex.stalldetection is "10mb/2m" and it took 20 minutes to
get the first progress update, the granularity is clearly too low.

And then it could disregard the configuration, or suggest a better
configuration value, or adjust what it's expecting to match the
observed granularity.

(The stall detection auto-prober uses a similar heuristic to that already.
It observes the granularity and only if it's sufficiently low (an update
every 30 seconds or less) does it assume that 60 seconds without an update
may be a stall.)
