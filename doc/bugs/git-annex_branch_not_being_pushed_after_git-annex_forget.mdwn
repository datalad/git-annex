### Please describe the problem.
I have a repository that is being synced with a normal Bitbucket git repository (with `annex-ignore = true`). It's been created with the webapp in direct mode and I'm using the assistant.

Everything is working fine, but after running `git annex forget` the git-annex branch in Bitbucket stopped being pushed. git-annex is still working correctly, but I have a lot of useless commits in the history.

So currently I have this branches:

    # git branch -a
    * annex/direct/master
      git-annex
      master
      synced/master
      remotes/bitbucket/git-annex
      remotes/bitbucket/master
      remotes/bitbucket/synced/git-annex
      remotes/bitbucket/synced/master

And `remotes/bitbucket/git-annex` isn't being updated with the content of `git-annex`

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?

5.20150812 and 5.20150731 in Debian Sid and Testing

### Please provide any additional information below.

As I've said, git-annex is still working normally, so the solution might be to simply remove that branch.

### Have you had any luck using git-annex before? (Sometimes we get tired of reading bug reports all day and a lil' positive end note does wonders)

I use `git-annex` daily with 3 repositories with a total of ~112GB, and I'm really happy with it. Thank you very much for the effort.
