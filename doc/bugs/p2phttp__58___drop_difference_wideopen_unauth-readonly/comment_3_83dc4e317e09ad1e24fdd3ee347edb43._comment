It's not a special case about locking. p2phttp always uses 403 when 
the mode it's serving does not allow the class of action.

Eg with --unauth-appendonly a remove request will cause a 403 response.
And with --unauth-readonly any non-read request does.

The docs say:

"When authentication is successful but does not allow a request to be
performed, it will fail with 403 Forbidden."

A 401 does make git-annex prompt for a password. p2phttp responds to that
when --authenv is used and the client didn't basic authenticate.
