This bug report might have been a bit prematurely, I just noticed that p2phttp returns a 403 for the file locking endpoints in the case of unauth-readonly, while my forgejo-aneksajo implementation returns a 401. This seems to make git-annex prompt for a password instead of falling back to just checking presence.
