I've solved my issue in forgejo-aneksajo by special-casing the lockcontent endpoint to return a 403 for unauthorized requests, instead of a 401 like all other POST endpoints (put, remove, etc.). I presume that this is also what `git annex p2phttp` itself does, is that right? Maybe the specific response expected by git-annex in case of an unauthorized requests could be part of the protocol specification...
