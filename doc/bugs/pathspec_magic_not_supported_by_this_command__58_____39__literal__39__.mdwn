### Please describe the problem.

I have some paths containing swedish characters (åäö ÅÄÖ).
Some paths also contains the character "@".
I use git annex assistant in autostart mode on my Documents folder.

I get the following errors in the log file:

[[!format sh """
fd:37: commitBuffer: invalid argument (invalid character)

"""]]

I also notice a lot of zombie git processes in the ps list.

### What steps will reproduce the problem?

Upgrade to Version: 5.20150406-gb2814bc
Build flags: Assistant Webapp Webapp-secure Pairing Testsuite S3 WebDAV Inotify DBus DesktopNotify XMPP DNS Feeds Quvi TDFA 

Pre compiled tar.gz 

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?

Version: 5.20150406-gb2814bc

Arch linux

[daniel@wintermute Documents]$ uname -a
Linux wintermute 3.19.2-1-ARCH #1 SMP PREEMPT Wed Mar 18 16:21:02 CET 2015 x86_64 GNU/Linux


### Please provide any additional information below.

If I downgrade to a previous version ie. git-annex.linux.5.20150317 the described problem is gone.

I tried to remove the character "@" from my paths, but it didn't help.

Looking at the log file below, it doesn't seem to have anything to do with my swedish characters.
