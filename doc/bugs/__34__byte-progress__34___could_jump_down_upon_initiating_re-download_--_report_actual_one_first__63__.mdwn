### Please describe the problem.

someone kinda could consider it a 'feature' but it complicates use of the output since then progressbar should jump down and some progressbar libraries 
do not "support" that

### What steps will reproduce the problem?

initiate download, interrupt it, try to redownload it... I guess in some cases redownload doesn't start at the point where it was previously interrupted but somewhat before, or restarts altogether.  But annex first reports in --json-progress the size of previously downloaded portion and then goes down.  see below

so, my life would be easier, if annex did not report "unconfirmed initial progress" at all I guess

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?
