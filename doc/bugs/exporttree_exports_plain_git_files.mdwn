### Please describe the problem.

### What steps will reproduce the problem?


git-annex initremote 2gt type=directory directory=/Volumes/2gt/photos encryption=none importtree=yes exporttree=yes

git annex export  HEAD  -t 2gt

.gitignore and .gitattributes (plain git, not annexed) make it to the export. 

Tried to limit this with (inbackend=SHA256E or inbackend=SHA512E) , did not help.

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?

10.20250721 , homebrew on Mac

### Please provide any additional information below.

# If you can, paste a complete transcript of the problem occurring here.
# If the problem is with the git-annex assistant, paste in .git/annex/daemon.log


# End of transcript or log.

### Have you had any luck using git-annex before? (Sometimes we get tired of reading bug reports all day and a lil' positive end note does wonders)
