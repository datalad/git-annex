### Please describe the problem.
When I try to add a box.com cloud repository with the encryption option selected, I get an error that says "internal server error". 

### What steps will reproduce the problem?
Anytime I try to set up a cloud repository with box.com (and presumably others, since this seems to be a problem with gpg (see log)) that is encrypted, I get this error.


### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?
The operating system is Mac OS X 10.8.4, and the version of git-annex is 4.20130801-gc88bbc4.


### Please provide any additional information below.
