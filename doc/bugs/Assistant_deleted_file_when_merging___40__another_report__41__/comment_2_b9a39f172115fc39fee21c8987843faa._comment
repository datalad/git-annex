So, looking at `git log` has a clue...

The commit message is

    git-annex in <OLD REPO NAME>

So... I guess I've switched in the webapp to the `unwanted` repo and it's gone and deleted the files.

That seems weird.  I would have thought that the type of the repo `unwanted`/`full backup`/etc. would be part of the details shared by a sync and so commands in the old repo should know that it is `unwanted`.  Somehow auto-*magic*-ally I would have hoped that `unwanted` repos would be not dominant in merges.

So @joeyh should I change this bug to something about `unwanted` repos being passive aggressive? ;-)

## However...

I'd still like some suggestion(s) on how to get my files back...
