> It's actually possible to make brand-new git-annex repos use all lower case hash directories today, by setting git config annex.tune.objecthashlower true before you run git annex init for the first time.

Am I interpreting this correctly, that this sets some attribute in the git-annex branch, so that clones of this repo will use the same annex layout?
