I just had the same problem. An `addurl` test failing while building on MacOS with `nix-shell -p git-annex`. I recorded a video of it coincidentally. I don't know what's with the `security` program it tries to call. I was using a MacOS VM via [Docker-OSX](https://github.com/sickcodes/Docker-OSX?tab=readme-ov-file#big-sur-).
