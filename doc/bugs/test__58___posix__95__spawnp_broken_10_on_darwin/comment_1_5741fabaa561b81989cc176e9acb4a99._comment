This error message seems to indicate that git-annex tried to run a program
named "security", which does not exist.

I can reproduce the error message like so:

	ghci> createProcess (proc "security" [])
	*** Exception: security: createProcess: posix_spawnp: does not exist (No such file or directory)

Since git-annex definitely does not normally try to run a program named
"security" -- it doesn't even contain any String with that value -- I am
puzzled by what could be causing it to do so. My best guess is something in
your git configuration might be set. For example:

	joey@darkstar:~/tmp/xx>git config annex.freezecontent-command security
	joey@darkstar:~/tmp/xx>git-annex addurl file:///bin/sh
	addurl file:///bin/sh
	(to _bin_sh) sh: 1: security: not found

Which well, rules out that particular git config, but there are several git
configs that specify a command to run, so some other one.

However, the test suite also runs with `GIT_CONFIG_NOSYSTEM` set, so git won't read
the system gitconfig file, and it also sets HOME to a temp directory to avoid reading
`~/.gitconfig`. So normally even such a git config setting should not affect the test suite.
