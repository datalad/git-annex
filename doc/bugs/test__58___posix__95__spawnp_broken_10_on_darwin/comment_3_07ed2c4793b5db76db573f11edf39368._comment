This seems like a bug in Nix. 

"security" is a MacOS command.
<https://ss64.com/mac/security.html>

Several haskell packages contain code that runs it. For example
<https://hackage.haskell.org/package/certificate>
in System/Certificate/X509/MacOS.hs:

	createProcess (proc "security" ["find-certificate" ...

I've not checked which one is getting
pulled into git-annex here, it may vary depending on versions of
intermediate library dependencies. This search finds several
other possibilities:
<https://hackage-search.serokell.io/?q=%22security%22>

And presumably on Nix that program is not in PATH. So it needs to either
depend on it, or patch out call to it.

The Nix maintainers of git-annex have been emailed about this.
