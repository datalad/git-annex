### Please describe the problem.
on [[tips/downloading_podcasts/]] it says to look for "Feeds" in the output of version to see if you have the importfeeds support. I have importfeeds support but "Feeds" is not listed when doing version.

### What steps will reproduce the problem?
# git-annex version
# git-annex importfeed <someurl>

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?
4.20130802 on Debian unstable

### Please provide any additional information below.
