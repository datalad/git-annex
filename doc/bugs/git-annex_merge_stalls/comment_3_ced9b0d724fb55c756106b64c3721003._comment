This problem cleared up after a reboot (and a crash, apparently).

<pre>
joeyh so, my thought is that perhaps you had a git-annex process before that was holding the lock.
joeyh for example, if you ran it and ctrl-z'd at just the right time, it could be suspended and holding the lock
joeyh (or the kernel coud have gotten confused, which given you also had a crash, who knows..)
dp sounds logical
joeyh forcing locks is always a problematic thing
joeyh but git-annex could certainly notice if it seems to be stalled and print some useful messages
joeyh and maybe have a way to run with locks forced
