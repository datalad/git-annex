The bug that caused merge to empty the repo was fixed in a newer
version of git-annex than the 5.20150219 that you're using
on your android device. So, you should upgrade.

git-annex is supposed to be completely filename encoding agnostic.
Need to investigate what might be breaking that on Android. 
Perhaps it's really git, and not git-annex, that's
crashing with the "unable to create file" error?

Seems so; git's entry.c contains that message.
