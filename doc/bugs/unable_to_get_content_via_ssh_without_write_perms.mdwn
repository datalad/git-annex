### Please describe the problem.

For many collaborative workflows it is desired to provide read-only access to a git-annex repository on a remote ssh host.

But apparently, even if user does have read access to the content, git-annex (shell?) tries to lock the entire remote repository leading to a crash:

[[!format sh """
lena:/tmp
$> git clone localhost:/tmp/testroot testroot-clone

and original user reported a little different error (I have no access to see the details of that repository):

```

this severely limits git-annex usability for many collaboration  scenarios. I just wonder how come we did not run into this before...

I guess the git-annex-shell must not lock anything until some write operation is really necessary.


### What steps will reproduce the problem?

create a git-annex repo owned by another user, provide permissions for others to read, try to `get` any annexed content via ssh

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?
