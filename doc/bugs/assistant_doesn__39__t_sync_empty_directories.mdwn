### Please describe the problem.

The assistant seems to only sync files and not directories, so empty directories will not be synced.

### What steps will reproduce the problem?

- Create an empty directory on HostA
- See that nothing gets synced (daemon.log is silent) and the directory doesn't exist on the other HostB
- Create an empty file inside the empty directory on HostA
- See that now HostB has the empty file inside the directory

I'm sure this comes directly from the git behavior but is at least surprising for a direct mode repository using the assistant.
