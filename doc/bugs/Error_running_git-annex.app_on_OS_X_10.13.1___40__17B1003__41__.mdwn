### Please describe the problem.
git-annex doesn't start.

### What steps will reproduce the problem?
launch git-annex from terminal (if it is ran from GUI it doesn't open without notifying any error)

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?
Version: 6.20171128-g58b04cd2e on OS X 10.13.1 (17B1003)

### Please provide any additional information below.
I solved the issue by manually changing the file /Applications/git-annex.app/Contents/MacOS/bundle/B which is an alias pointing to the file /Applications/git-annex.app/Contents/MacOS/bundle/usr/lib/libz.1.dylib with a new alias having the same name 'B' which link to /usr/lib/libz.1.dylb.
I'm pretty sure this is not an optimal and general solution, but it is useful in order to prove what's the problem. Further, for it worked.

### Have you had any luck using git-annex before? (Sometimes we get tired of reading bug reports all day and a lil' positive end note does wonders)
