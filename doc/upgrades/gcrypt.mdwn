Unfortunately the initial gcrypt repository layout had to be changed
after git-annex version 4.20130920. If you have an encrypted git repository
created using version 4.20130920 or 4.20130909, you need to manually
upgrade it.

If you look at the contents of your gcrypt repository, you will
see a bare git repository, with a few three-letter subdirectories,
which are where git-annex stores its encrypted file contents:

<pre>
27f/  branches/  description  hooks/  objects/
HEAD  config     f37/         info/   refs/
</pre>

In the example above, the subdirectories are `27f` and `f37`.

All you need to do to transition is move those subdirectories
into an `annex/objects` directory.

	mkdir annex ; mkdir annex/objects ; mv 27f f37 annex/objects

Probably those are the only 3 letter things inside your git repository,
so this will probably work:

	mkdir annex ; mkdir annex/objects ; mv ??? annex/objects
