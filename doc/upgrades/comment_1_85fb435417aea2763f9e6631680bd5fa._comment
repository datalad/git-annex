I'm curious about the choice to change the behavior of critical git commands (such as add) in such a drastic way in V6, i.e. why does \"git add\" no longer add files to the git repo? The default of annex should be exclusive rather than inclusive, I shouldn't need to specify which files to *exclude* from annex, rather the other way around. This is an especially confusing default for code. What is the logic here?
