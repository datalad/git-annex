# NAME

git-annex rekey - change keys used for files

# SYNOPSIS

git annex rekey `[file key ...]`

# DESCRIPTION

This plumbing-level command is similar to migrate, but you specify
both the file, and the new key to use for it.

Multiple pairs of file and key can be given in a single command line.

Note that, unlike `git-annex migrate`, this does not copy over metadata,
urls, and other such information from the old to the new key

# OPTIONS

* `--force`

  Allow rekeying of even files whose content is not currently available.
  Use with caution.

* `--batch`

  Enables batch mode, in which lines are read from stdin.
  Each line should contain the file, and the new key to use for that file,
  separated by a single space.

* `-z`

  Makes the `--batch` input be delimited by nulls instead of the usual
  newlines.

* `--json`

  Enable JSON output. This is intended to be parsed by programs that use
  git-annex. Each line of output is a JSON object.

* `--json-error-messages`

  Messages that would normally be output to standard error are included in
  the JSON instead.

* Also the [[git-annex-common-options]](1) can be used.
