# NAME

git-annex webapp - launch webapp

# SYNOPSIS

git annex webapp

# DESCRIPTION

Opens a web app, that allows easy setup of a git-annex repository,
and control of the git-annex assistant. If the assistant is not
already running, it will be started.

By default, the webapp can only be accessed from localhost, and running
it opens a browser window.

# OPTIONS

* `--listen=address`

  Useful for using the webapp on a remote computer. This makes the webapp
  listen on the specified address.

  This disables running a local web browser, and outputs the url you
  can use to open the webapp.

  Set annex.listen in the git config to make the webapp always
  listen on an address.

# USING HTTPS

When using the webapp on a remote computer, you'll almost certainly
want to enable HTTPS. The webapp will use HTTPS if it finds
a .git/annex/privkey.pem and .git/annex/certificate.pem. Here's
one way to generate those files, using a self-signed certificate:
  
	openssl genrsa -out .git/annex/privkey.pem 4096
	openssl req -new -x509 -key .git/annex/privkey.pem > .git/annex/certificate.pem
