I don't know if this is expected behaviour, but for some files I imported from an importtree, when I use git-annex whereused --key with the correct key, nothing is shown unless I also add --historical

And then I am shown the importtree branch information. It doesn't seem to make sense to me. The file is definitely present, and git-annex whereis confirms this, as does git-annex lock/unlock

Willing to add more context if this is a little too vague
