This is a simple way to split a repository, but the resulting split git
repository will be larger than is really necessary.

When you `dropunused` all the hard links that are not present in the
repository, git-annex will commit a log to the git-annex branch saying "I
don't have this content" for each of them. That seems unnecessary since
it probably does not have an earlier log saying it contained the content
that was hard linked into it, and perhaps could be improved in git-annex
to not record that unncessarily, but that's what it does currently.

So I suggest running `git annex forget` after the dropunused or at some
later point. That will delete all traces of those log files from
the git-annex branch.
