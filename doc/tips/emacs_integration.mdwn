bergey has developed an emacs mode for browsing git-annex repositories,
dired style.

<https://gitorious.org/emacs-contrib/annex-mode>

Locally available files are colored differently, and pressing g runs
`git annex get` on the file at point.

John Wiegley has developed a brand new git-annex interaction mode for
Emacs, which aims to integrate with the standard facilities
(C-x C-q, M-x dired, etc) rather than invent its own interface.

<https://github.com/jwiegley/git-annex-el>

He has also added support to org-attach; if
`org-attach-git-annex-cutoff` is non-nil and smaller than the size
 of the file you're attaching then org-attach will `git annex add` the
file; otherwise it will `git add` it.

[magit-annex](https://github.com/magit/magit-annex) adds git annex
operations to Magit.
