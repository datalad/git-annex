Sure it will work fine to have different versions of annexed files. 
git-annex will know the url it can use to get whichever version is checked
out in the current git branch.

As for an easier way, it's possible to use [[git-annex-import]]
with certian special remotes, which imports a tree of files from them, and
re-running it imports whatever files are new or changed. This needs a
special remote that supports it, and it would perhaps be possible to write
such a special remote for Zenodo. Dunno if it would be worth the work to
implement, but it may be worth seeing if Datalad could support that, if
you use Datalad.
