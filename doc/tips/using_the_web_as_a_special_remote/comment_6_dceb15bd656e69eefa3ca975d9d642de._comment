Using the URL backend for youtube is intentional. Youtube may serve up different encodings for the same video over time, and this way git-annex treats them all as equvilant. If you want to \"freeze\" the repository to the current one, use `git annex migrate`, and be prepared for `git annex get --from web` to not work long term.
