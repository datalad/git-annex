There are resources that I want to add to my annex that are currently available
via a URL, but it seems like if I add these using `git-annex addurl`, they get
symlinked to file in the annex/objects directory that starts with `URL-...`,
instead of the more typical `SHA256-...`, and this does not change even after
the files are downloaded.

My concern is that I really want to ensure that these files don't change, which
is the appeal of content-addressable symlinking of normal files (as opposed to
URL addressable ones).

Would there be a way to automate the injection of hash-based symlinking for
files that are added via addurl? Sometimes I add a bunch of files via ``addurl
--fast``, and after I've download them via ``get``, it would be nice to have
those files have the same level of data integrity as when I download them using
something outside of git-annex, add them to the annex, and do an ``addurl
--file`` afterward.

Thanks for all of your hard work!
