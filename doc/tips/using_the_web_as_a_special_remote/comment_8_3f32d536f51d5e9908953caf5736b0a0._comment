Hi!

I have a somewhat interesting use case. My course notes require HTTP authentication. This is possible with wget, but is there any way to make git annex do it?

[wget authentication stuff!](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4272770/wget-with-authentication)

It would be nice to have the user and pass encrypted with GPG too. This might be a strange use case, but I can see other people wanting to do something like this in the future.

Thanks!
