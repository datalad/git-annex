Hello,
I'm trying to use of Git-annex for some scientific applications, with a specific use case in mind:

1. One large file is published on Zenodo.org, with a specific and permanent URL for each version (past & future).

2. I annexed the current version with something like : `git annex addurl --file=my-input-file  <the-url-of-the-current-version-on-zenodo> ; git commit ... ; git annex sync`

3. When a newer version is published on Zenodo, I would like to \"upgrade\" the annexed file to the newer version.
I did some experiment and it seems to work by doing this : `git rm my-input-file ; git annex addurl --file=my-input-file <the-url-of-the-newer-version-on-zenodo> ; git commit ... ; git annex sync `

Does that make sense ? is there any risk ? is there a easier/more direct way to achieve what I want ?

Thanks in advance for your support !
