So you lost a thumb drive containing a git-annex repository. Or a hard
drive died or some other misfortune has befallen your data.

Unless you configured backups, git-annex can't get your data back. But it
can help you deal with the loss.

Go somewhere that knows about the lost repository, and mark it as
dead:

	git annex dead usbdrive

This retains the [[location_tracking]] information for the repository,
but avoids trying to access it, or list it as a location where files
are present.

If you later found the drive, you could let git-annex know it's found
like so:

	git annex semitrust usbdrive
