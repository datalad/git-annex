is there a way for this to be done globally, without having to install and configure the hook for each repository? it seems like a fairly useful feature that could be factored in git-annex itself (as opposed to be shipped as a shell script)...

also, is there a way to retroactively parse the tags from existing files (as opposed to only new files added to the repo).

thanks
