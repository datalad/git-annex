@Joey just tested a nightly build and now pre-commit-annex is called, and with my modifications it autoadds last modified times for content.
Trivially it's just the matter of adding:

	field=\"datemod\"
	value=$(stat -c %Y $f)
	addmeta \"$f\" \"$field\" \"$value\"

to the body of the process() function to the supplied pre-commit-annex script.
