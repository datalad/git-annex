seemingly pre-commit hooks are not being called on windows, it could have to do with git annex sync bypassing them when doing commits ?

on the other side genmetadata works. although that is not enough for me since I'd want to preserve complete last modification date/time and I was in the process of modifying the supplied pre-commit script to call for \"stat %Y\" (which btw is working fine on windows, while the last binaries for extract are failing there).

am I correct in assuming that direct mode [on windows at least] bypasses hooks [namely pre-commit as well as pre-commit-annex] ?
