@woffs hmm, the hook script seems to quote every use of the filename,
which should avoid such problems. I tested it, using both extract
and exiftool, and a file named "foo'bar.jpg", and it worked fine.

If you have a case where it does not work, suggest you file a bug
report with enough information to reproduce the problem.
