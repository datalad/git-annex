Note that while bare repos can have worktrees in git, the combination is not really supported in git-annex; as a result,

* `git annex add` doesn't work (\"You cannot run this command in a bare repository.\") and
* `git annex fix` would change all object links from two-character (`../.git/annex/objects/KP/4p/SHA256...`) to three-character (`../.git/annex/objects/7e3/613/SHA256...`) names.
