git-annex will probe to detect if the filesystem does not support FIFOs and
disables `annex.sshcaching` in that case. It's done so since 2013. So I would
be surprised if NFS had any problems with annex.sshcaching.

`git config annex.pidlock true` will make git-annex avoid FCNTL locking,
and so work on filesystems that don't support that. It should also
avoid the ".nfs" files.

It's not enabled by default on NFS because I don't currently have a good
way to probe if a given directory is on NFS.

Also, annex.pidlock makes git-annex significantly slower and less safe.
But if you're using NFS, speed and safety must have already been
de-prioritized.

Seriously, my main advice for using git-annex on NFS is: 
Don't. Make local clones of repositories and use git-annex to distribute
the files around. Unless your institution forces you to use a networked
filesystem to access gobs of disk space, and you need to have more files
present in a repository than will fit locally.
