Hello,

I decommissioned a machine and installed git annex on another machine, with the same IP as the initial one. To avoid errors, I declared the first repository as dead and created a new one (with a new remote). However, I also had to remove the git remote to the dead machine as \"git annex sync\" kept telling me synchronizing to this dead machine failed (the ssh succeeded, using the name automatically generated by git annex, but the repository was not at the same path on the new machine, so it could not find it).

Should a dead repository not tried to be synchronized at all during git annex sync?

Thanks,

Alan
