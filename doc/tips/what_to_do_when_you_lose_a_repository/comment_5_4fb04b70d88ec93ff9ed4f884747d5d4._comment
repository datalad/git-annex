Unfortunately, I plugged in the drive and it was alive just long enough to clone the repo and pull down about half of the data. Then it just started clicking. I did my best to wipe the drive before I returned it, but it didn't even make it that far.

Now I've got a replacement drive. Since my system auto-mounts based on the partition label; I had been using the label to identify external drives. So I want to describe the drive the same way to my system & git-annex. 

In this case, I think I'd like to completely get rid of any notion the repos have of the old drive.
