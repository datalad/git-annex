Both `git annex sync` and `git pull` will still try to access the git
remote for the repository. Thing to do to prevent this is `git remote
remove` it.

I think it makes sense for `git annex sync` to still try to push/pull
from a dead remote, since git pull/push will still try to access it
too. Marking the remote dead does prevent other git-annex commands
from trying to use it for data storage.
