I tried to use the dir UUID - found by using 

    git ls-tree origin/master

This however also fails:

    git annex export fd94c0f44ff40b07bcbe58d4c3921c6fb35c7074 -t box.com
    export box.com file1 (not available) failed
    export box.com file2 (not available) failed
    ...
    export box.com file10 (not available) failed
    (recording state in git...)
    git-annex: export: 10 failed

Does anybody know what's wrong?
