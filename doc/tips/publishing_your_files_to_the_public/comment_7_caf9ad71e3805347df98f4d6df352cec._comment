The reason exporting a subdir puts the files at the root of the folder
is that it's exporting a git tree, and files in the tree of a subdir
are relative to that subdir.

It's certianly possible to make git construct a tree object that
contains a subdirectory containing the files you want to export, and
then exporting that tree object would replicate that tree structure,
including the subdir. One way is to check out a branch, delete the files
you don't want to export and once things are arranged as you like,
commit to that branch and then export it.

(Or you could just make the webdav special remote's url include the
subdir where you wanrt it to export stuff.)
