Thanks Giovanni for that nice tip!

You can additionally publish the whole git repository
by eg pushing it to github. (Not if it contains private files
or if you have embedded encryption keys or credentials though.)

You can tell git-annex the public url for the files too, and then others
can just clone the git repository and use git-annex to download the files
from S3.

You could set that up by running something like this:

	for filename in $(git annex find --in public-s3); do
		git annex addurl --file "$filename" https://public-annex.s3.amazonaws.com/"$(git annex lookupkey $filename)"
	done
