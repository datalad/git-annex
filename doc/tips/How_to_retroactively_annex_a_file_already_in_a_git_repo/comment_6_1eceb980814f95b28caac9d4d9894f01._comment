Hmm, guyz? Are you serious with these scripts?

1. git rm -r --cached large_files
# files are indexed as both removed and untracked and are still in place
2. commit the changes
# files are seen as untracked
3. git annex add large_files
# files are replaced with symlinks and are in the index
4. commit changes again

Make sure that you don't have annex.largefiles settings that would prevent annexing the files.
