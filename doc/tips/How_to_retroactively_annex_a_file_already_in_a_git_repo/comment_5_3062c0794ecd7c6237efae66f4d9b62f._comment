I recently had the need of re-kind-of-annexing an unusually large repo (one of the largest?).
With some tricks and the right code I managed to get it down to 170000 commits in 19 minutes and extracing ~8GB of blobs. 
Attaching the link here as I feel it might be helpful for very large projects (where git-filter-branch can become prohibitively slow)
