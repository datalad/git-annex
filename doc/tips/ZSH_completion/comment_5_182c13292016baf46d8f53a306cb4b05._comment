Well, the code that generates the zsh completions could
always be improved.
<https://github.com/pcapriotti/optparse-applicative/issues>

I don't really understand why completing options before filenames makes
it unusable. It means that "git-annex tabtabtab" cycles through options
first, but if you type part of the filename tab will complete the rest.
It does seem that someone else agrees with you though, as they filed
this issue: <https://github.com/pcapriotti/optparse-applicative/issues/173>
