[[!meta title="annex.largefiles: configuring mixed content repositories"]]

Normally commands like `git annex add` always add files to the annex.
And when using the v6 repository mode, even `git add` and `git commit -a`
will add files to the annex.

Let's suppose you're developing a video game, written in C. You have
source code, and some large game assets. You want to ensure the source
code is stored in git -- that's what git's for! And you want to store
the game assets in the git annex -- to avod bloating your git repos with
possibly enormous files, but still version control them.

The annex.largefiles configuration is useful for such mixed content
repositories. It's checked by `git annex add`, by `git add` and `git commit -a`
(in v6 repositories), by `git annex import` and the assistant. It's
also used by `git annex addurl` and `git annex importfeed` when downloading
files. When a file does not match annex.largefiles, these commands will
add its content to git instead of to the annex.

## examples

For example, let's make only files larger than 100 kb be added to the annex,
and never *.c and *.h source files.

Write this to the `.gitattributes` file:

	* annex.largefiles=(largerthan=100kb)
	*.c annex.largefiles=nothing
	*.h annex.largefiles=nothing

Or, set the git configuration instead:
  
	git config annex.largefiles 'largerthan=100kb and not (include=*.c or include=*.h)'

Both of these settings do the same thing. Setting it in the `.gitattributes`
file makes any checkout of the repository share that configuration, so is often
a good choice. Setting the annex.largefiles git configuration lets different
checkouts behave differently. The git configuration overrides the
`.gitattributes` configuration.

## syntax

The way the `.gitattributes` example above works is, *.c and *.h files
have the annex.largefiles attribute set to "nothing", which matches nothing,
and so those files are never treated as large files. All other files use
the other value, which checks the file size.

The value of annex.largefiles is a
[[preferred content expression|git-annex-preferred-content]] that is
used to match the large files.

Note that, since git attribute values cannot contain whitespace,
it's useful to instead parenthesize the terms of the 
[[preferred content expression|git-annex-preferred-content]]. This trick
allows setting the annex.largefiles attribute to more complicated expressions.
For example, this is the same as the git config shown earlier, shoehorned
into a git attribute:

	* annex.largefiles=(largerthan=100kb)and(not((include=*.c)or(include=*.h)))

## temporarily override

If you've set up an annex.largefiles configuration but want to force a file to
be stored in the annex, you can temporarily override the configuration like
this:

	git annex add -c annex.largefiles=anything smallfile
