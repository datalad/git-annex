Thanks and sorry to trouble you, it is my error, I picked unencrypted option (thinking it would be less of an issue) and am using a text file for test, gave an error line:

    10:53:07 [flickrannex-0.1.5] main : 'Unencrypted flickr can only accept picture and video files'

I've not looked through your code yet, but could that message be printed when not in debug mode?
