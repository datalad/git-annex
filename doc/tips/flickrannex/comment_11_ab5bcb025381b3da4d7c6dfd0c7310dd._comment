Hi, I am coming back to this and testing Flickr as a repository for moving files about and have run into what may be my very basic misunderstanding with vanilla annex.

I copied one file to Flickr and dropped it elsewhere (--force).  I assumed that the file was on Flickr ok but that the numcopies setting required the force because of the semi-trust level of the Flickr remote.

Then I find I can't get the file back, even though there is a record of it from whereis.

Can you help enlighten me as to what am I missing?  I assumed whereis would only report files that exist and can be copied back.  If not my error, I can raise bug or search for logs.  Thanks in advance for any help.
