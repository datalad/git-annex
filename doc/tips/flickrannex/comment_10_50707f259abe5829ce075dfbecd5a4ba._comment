I'm not even sure if chunksize is exposed to the hooks at all.

As it is, the hook will check the filesize, and if the filesize is more than 30mbyte it will exit 1.

Chunking may be implemented down the road. I do believe joeyh might have some plans that will touch this issue, so I'd rather wait. Than re-invent the wheel yet again.
