Q1: No commit on https://github.com/TobiasTheViking/flickrannex/commits/master since Jan 13, 2014. Is it still working?

Q2: I'm not sure I get it correctly.  Is it to use Flickr *photo* storage so that you can store git-annex content that is actually *photos* to visible Flickr collections (on web site) and vice versa (a nice white-hat hack)? Or is it just a cuckoo's hack to stuff arbitrary data on Flickr's servers without any content (a grey-zone hack)?
