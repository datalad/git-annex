I'm using [pipsi](https://github.com/mitsuhiko/pipsi) to install packages without polluting the system, [Michael's fork](https://github.com/mikemccracken/flickrannex) from magthe's fork from TobiasTheViking repo (I don't know if the other branches are better or worse, but this is working).

## Instructions

**First thing**: go to https://www.flickr.com/services/apps/create/noncommercial/? and create an app (if you use the keys provided in the flickrannex repository you'll be giving access to your flickr to everybody).

Now follow the steps:

```
wget https://github.com/mikemccracken/flickrannex/archive/master.zip
unzip master.zip
cd flickrannex-master/
edit setup.py # replace 'flickrapi' with 'flickrapi==1.4.5'
              # otherwise it will install a wrong version of the dependency.
edit flickrannex # on lines 46 and 47, replace the api_key and api_secret
                 # with the values from the application you created in the
                 # first step.
pipsi install ./
cd
flickrannex # go through the oauth setup, will open a window in the browser
            # some commands will appear after you're successful. ignore them.
cd ~/annex # your git-annex folder
git config annex.flickr-hook $HOME/.local/bin/flickrannex
git annex initremote flickr type=hook hooktype=flickr encryption=none
```
