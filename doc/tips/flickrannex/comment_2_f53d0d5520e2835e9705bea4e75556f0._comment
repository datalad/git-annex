9 days ago: [the annex] \"hook format a few versions ago, and this is using the new hook format\".

Looks very handy. I am just starting with this, but can't seem to get it working as a remote after following the simple walkthrough. All goes well until:

    $ git annex copy . --to flickr
    copy walkthrough.sh (checking flickr...) 
      missing configuration for flickr-checkpresent-hook
    git-annex: checkpresent hook misconfigured

my Ubuntu 12.04:

    $ git annex version
    git-annex version: 4.20130516.1
    build flags: Assistant Webapp Pairing Testsuite S3 WebDAV Inotify DBus XMPP
    local repository version: 3
    default repository version: 3
    supported repository versions: 3 4
    upgrade supported from repository versions: 0 1 2

I guess my \"git-annex version is still too old\"? Any idea what version is needed? Even better if I can figure out which Linux distribution/release has the most up to date version of annex.
