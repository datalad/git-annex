I tried to use Backblaze B2 using the second method, and tried different application key permissions. Hopefully I can save your time if you’re going to use this special remote.

In order to init a B2 remote, you should create a key with the ability to read & write all buckets, and you must create a new bucket using git-annex (by setting a unique name in `bucket=`). If you create an empty bucket using Backblaze's web UI, then use that bucket for `git annex initremote`, you will receive this error message: `(InternalException (HandshakeFailed (Error_Protocol (\"expecting server hello, got alert : [(AlertLevel_Fatal,IllegalParameter)]\",True,HandshakeFailure))))`.

In order to enable a B2 remote, you need a key with read & write permission to the bucket you're using. If you created a key with only read permission, you can’t use `git annex get` on that remote.
