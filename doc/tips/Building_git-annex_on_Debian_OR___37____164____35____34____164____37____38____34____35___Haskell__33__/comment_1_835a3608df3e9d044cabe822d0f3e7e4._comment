possibly related to this Debian issue:

trying to install git-annex with cabal on OS X 10.8.3, the build fails with


    Loading package DAV-0.4 ... linking ... ghc: 
    lookupSymbol failed in relocateSection (relocate external)
    ~/.cabal/lib/DAV-0.4/ghc-7.4.2/HSDAV-0.4.o: unknown symbol `_DAVzm0zi4_PathszuDAV_version1_closure'
    ghc: unable to load package `DAV-0.4'
    Failed to install git-annex-4.20130417
    cabal: Error: some packages failed to install:
    git-annex-4.20130417 failed during the building phase. The exception was:
    ExitFailure 1


This was after following all of the instructions for the Homebrew install at [http://git-annex.branchable.com/install/OSX/](http://git-annex.branchable.com/install/OSX/)
I was able to work around this issue by installing with the WebDAV flag disabled (ie, added the option --flags=\"-WebDAV\" to last command in the OS X install instructions):

    cabal install git-annex --bindir=$HOME/bin --flags=\"-WebDAV\"
