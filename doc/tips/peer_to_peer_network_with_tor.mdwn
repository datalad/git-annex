git-annex has recently gotten support for running as a
[Tor](https://torproject.org/) hidden service. This is a nice secure
and easy to use way to connect repositories in different
locations. No account on a central server is needed; it's peer-to-peer.

## dependencies

To use this, you need to get Tor installed and running. See
[their website](https://torproject.org/), or try a command like:

	sudo apt-get install tor

You also need to install [Magic Wormhole](https://github.com/warner/magic-wormhole).

	sudo apt-get install magic-wormhole

## pairing two repositories

You have two git-annex repositories on different computers, and want to
connect them together over Tor so they share their contents. Or, you and a
friend want to connect your repositories together. Pairing is an easy way
to accomplish this.

In each git-annex repository, run these commands:

	git annex enable-tor
	git annex remotedaemon

The enable-tor command may prompt for the root password, since it
configures Tor. Now git-annex is running as a Tor hidden service, but 
it will only talk to peers after pairing with them.

In both repositories, run this command:

	git annex p2p --pair

This will print out a pairing code, like "11-incredible-tumeric",
and prompt for you to enter the other repository's pairing code.

Once the pairing codes are exchanged, the two repositories will be securely
connected to one-another via Tor. Each will have a git remote, with a name
like "peer1", which connects to the other repository.

Then, you can run commands like `git annex sync peer1 --content` to sync
with the paired repository.

Pairing connects just two repositories, but you can repeat the process to
pair with as many other repositories as you like, in order to build up
larger networks of repositories.

## how to exchange pairing codes

When pairing with a friend's repository, you have to exchange
pairing codes. How to do this securely?

The pairing codes can only be used once, so it's ok to exchange them in
a way that someone else can access later. However, if someone can overhear
your exchange of codes in real time, they could trick you into pairing
with them.

Here are some suggestions for how to exchange the codes,
with the most secure ways first:

* In person.
* In an encrypted message (gpg signed email, Off The Record (OTR)
  conversation, etc).
* By a voice phone call.

## starting git-annex remotedaemon on boot

Notice the `git annex remotedaemon` being run in the above examples.
That command runs the Tor hidden service so that other peers
can connect to your repository over Tor.

So, you may want to arrange for the remotedaemon to be started on boot.
You can do that with a simple cron job:

	@reboot cd ~/myannexrepo && git annex remotedaemon

If you use the git-annex assistant, and have it auto-starting on boot, it
will take care of starting the remotedaemon for you.

## speed of large transfers

Tor prioritizes security over speed, and the Tor network only has so much
bandwidth to go around. So, distributing large quantities (gigabytes) 
of data over Tor may be slow, and should probably be avoided.

One way to avoid sending much data over tor is to set up an encrypted
[[special_remote|special_remotes]] someplace. git-annex knows that Tor is
rather expensive to use, so if a file is available on a special remote as
well as over Tor, it will download it from the special remote.

You can contribute to the Tor network by
[running a Tor relay or bridge](https://www.torproject.org/getinvolved/relays.html.en).

## onion addresses and authentication

You don't need to know about this, but it might be helpful to understand
how it works.

git-annex's Tor support uses onion address as the address of a git remote.
You can `git pull`, push, etc with those onion addresses:

	git pull tor-annnex::eeaytkuhaupbarfi.onion:4412
	git remote add peer1 tor-annnex::eeaytkuhaupbarfi.onion:4412

Onion addresses are semi-public. When you add a remote, they appear in your
`.git/config` file. For security, there's a second level of authentication
that git-annex uses to make sure that only people you want to can access
your repository over Tor. That takes the form of a long string of numbers
and letters, like "7f53c5b65b8957ef626fd461ceaae8056e3dbc459ae715e4".

The addresses generated by `git annex peer --gen-addresses` 
combine the onion address with the authentication data.

When you run `git annex peer --link`, it sets up a git remote using
the onion address, and it stashes the authentication data away in a file in
`.git/annex/creds/`

When you pair repositories, these addresses are exchanged using 
[Magic Wormhole](https://github.com/warner/magic-wormhole).

## security

Tor hidden services can be quite secure. But this doesn't mean that using
git-annex over Tor is automatically perfectly secure. Here are some things
to consider:

* Anyone who learns the address of a peer can connect to that peer,
  download the whole history of the git repository, and any available
  annexed files. They can also upload new files to the peer, and even
  remove annexed files from the peer. So consider ways that the address
  of a peer might be exposed.

* While Tor can be used to anonymize who you are, git defaults to including
  your name and email address in git commit messages. So if you want an
  anonymous git-annex repository, you'll need to configure git not to do
  that.

* Using Tor prevents listeners from decrypting your traffic. But, they'll
  probably still know you're using Tor. Also, by traffic analysis,
  they may be able to guess if you're using git-annex over tor, and even
  make guesses about the sizes and types of files that you're exchanging
  with peers.

* There have been past attacks on the Tor network that have exposed
  who was running Tor hidden services.
  <https://blog.torproject.org/blog/tor-security-advisory-relay-early-traffic-confirmation-attack>

* An attacker who can connect to the git-annex Tor hidden service, even
  without authenticating, can try to perform denial of service attacks.

* Magic wormhole is pretty secure, but the code phrase could be guessed
  (unlikely) or intercepted. An attacker gets just one chance to try to enter
  the correct code phrase, before pairing finishes. If the attacker
  successfully guesses/intercepts both code phrases, they can MITM the
  pairing process.

  If you don't want to use magic wormhole, you can instead manually generate
  addresses with `git annex p2p --gen-addresses` and send them over an
  authenticated, encrypted channel (such as OTR) to a friend to add with
  `git annex p2p --link`. This may be more secure, if you get it right.
