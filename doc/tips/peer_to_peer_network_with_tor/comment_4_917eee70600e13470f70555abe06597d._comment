@anarcat, I'm not sure I follow how git-annex would use that. It
does not currently use the tor control port at all when setting up
its tor hidden service. But please file a todo item if I'm wrong
and there's something to be improved.

(What would be useful is if tor came with the control port enabled
by default, and perhaps protected by something like onion-grater.
Then git-annex could use it when it installs its hidden service,
instead of its current approach of prompting for the root password
and modifying the torrc file.)
