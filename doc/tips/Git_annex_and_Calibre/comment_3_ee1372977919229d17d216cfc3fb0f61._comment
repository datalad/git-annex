Actually you do want to exclude \"cover.jpg\" from being annexed because it will allow you to view the covers of all your books without getting them.
Keeping metadata.opf out of annex is not that important because you cannot safely edit the metadata without getting the books first.

It would be great to teach Calibre to see broken symlinks as normal zero length files and work with them accordingly.
And we do need a Calibre plugin with buttons \"annex get\" and \"annex unlock\".
