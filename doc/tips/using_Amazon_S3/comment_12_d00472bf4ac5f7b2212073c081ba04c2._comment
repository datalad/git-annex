RE: my last comment

The reason I couldn't get it to work is because I didn't have proper read access to the bucket. My bad for not checking first but it would be great it there was a clearer error message from git-annex and/or a way to get more detailed information on the s3 extension (-d doesn't do much).

Regardless git-annex is pretty cool, thanks to all the maintainers for their hard work.
