Even after enableremote I can't get from s3.


	get Docs.zip (from s3...)

	  Unable to access these remotes: s3

	  Try making some of these repositories available:
	  	02b4e373-02b1-42b9-8285-c353c047895c -- my laptop
	   	f287b4f7-4e5a-4734-bd6b-62b1f4498838 -- [s3]

	  (Note that these git remotes have annex-ignore set: origin)
	failed
	git-annex: get: 1 failed


This is after all branches are pushed from my original repo. Any suggestions?
