For me, the `git annex initremote amazon-s3 encryption=shared embedcreds=yes` [1] command hung for several minutes after printing

    initremote amazon-s3 (encryption setup)

Turns out the problem was that I was low on entropy. Figured this out by running

    gpg --gen-random 2

per [this bug comment](https://github.com/DanielDent/git-annex-remote-rclone/issues/6#issuecomment-231347642). According to [this blog post](https://delightlylinux.wordpress.com/2015/07/01/is-gpg-hanging-when-generating-a-key/) a solution is to

    sudo aptitude install rng-tools
    sudo rngd -r /dev/urandom

The `git annex initremote` command had finished by the time I found that solution, but I verified that it made `gpg --gen-random 2` work.

System: Ubuntu 16.04 with Git Annex 5.20151208-1build1 installed via package manager.

[1] I'm using AWS credentials that are restricted to a specific bucket, so I'm not worried about the conjunction `encryption=shared` and `embedcreds=yes`.
