@james, since your keyring apparenty contains your secret key, the problem
may be in the configuration of your gpg agent or pinentry program. If the agent 
is unable to use pinentry for some reason, gpg will complain that the
secret key is unavailable since it is unable to get the passphrase to
unlock it.

I had a similar problem with gpg2 the other day:
