I use github as my central git repository and I would like to use S3 to store large files with annex. Since the s3 remote in .git/config is not stored in github, how do I make sure I reconnect to the same s3 bucket in case I delete my local clone? Reinitializing the remote will create a completely new bucket.

I would also be a good idea to centralize git-annex folders inside a single bucket so I keep the global namespace under control and can narrow down the permissioning.
