Lemao, make sure you have pushed your git-annex branch to your central git repository.

When you clone that repo elsewhere, you can add the S3 remote by running `git annex enableremote cloud` (replace \"cloud\" with whatever name you originally picked when you used `git annex initremote` to set up the S3 remote in the first place.

git-annex stores the necessary configuration of the S3 remote on the git-annex branch.
