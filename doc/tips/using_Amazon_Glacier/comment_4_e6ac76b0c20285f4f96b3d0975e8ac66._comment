Along with stupid python problems which are now fixed (all my fault, and hopefully didn't cause more noise here than needed), the only thing that didn't go as stated was:

[[!format sh \"\"\"
greg@x200s:~/Photos$ git-annex enableremote glacier
enableremote glacier 
  Set both AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY to use glacier
git-annex: Failed creating glacier vault.
greg@x200s:~/Photos$ AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=lolno AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=lolno git-annex enableremote glacier
enableremote glacier ok
(Recording state in git...)
greg@x200s:~/Photos$ 
\"\"\"]]

The guide says that info is sync'd.
