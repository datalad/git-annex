Thank you!  In my case though it is pretty much the entire history of the What I had in mind is a little different and probably not really possible: I wanted to have a completely disconnected history with a commit which had `$privatefile`s but in effect you are doing the same so I think the approach is \"the same\" in effect.
The only thing I would do differently is to first convert files to git-annex in `master` (to become `unredacted-master`), so I end up with the same tree in `unredacted-master` and `master` happen that later I would need to cherry-pick some changes accidentally committed (e.g. by collaborators) on top of `unredacted-master`.

Another note worthwhile making IMHO is that AFAIK those `git replace` markers are local only, and whoever has unredacted-master later on might need to set them up as well for their local clones to make such a \"collapse\" of histories.
