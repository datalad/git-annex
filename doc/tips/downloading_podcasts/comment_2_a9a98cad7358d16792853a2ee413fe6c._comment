@ckeen You seem to be using a filesystem that does not support filenames 150 characters long. This is unusual -- even windows and android can support a filename up to 255 characters in length. `git-annex addurl` already deals with this sort of problem by limiting the filename to 255 characters. If you'd like to file a bug report with details about your system, I can try to make git-annex support its limitations, I suppose.
