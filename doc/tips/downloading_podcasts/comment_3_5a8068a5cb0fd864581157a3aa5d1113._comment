Looking forward to seeing it in Debian unstable; where it will definitely replace my hpodder setup.

I guess there is no easy way to re-use the files already downloaded with hpodder? At first I thought that `git annex importfeed --relaxed` followed by adding the files to the git annex would work, but `importfeed` stores URLs, not content-based hashes, so it wouldnâ€™t match up.
