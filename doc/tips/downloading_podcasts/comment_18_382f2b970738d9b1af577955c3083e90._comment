Hi,

the explanations to --fast and --relaxed on this page could be extended a bit. I looked it up in the man page, but it is not yet clear to me when I would use one or the other with feeds. Also, does “Next time you run git annex addurl it will only fetch any new items.” really only apply to --relaxed, and not --fast?

Furthermore, it would be good if there were a template variable `itemnum` that I can use to ensure that `ls` prints the casts in the right order, even when the titles of the items are not helpful.

Greetings,
Joachim
