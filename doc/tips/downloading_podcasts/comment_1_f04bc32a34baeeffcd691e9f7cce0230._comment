It seems that some of my feeds get stored into keys that generate a too long filename:

    podcasts/.git/annex/tmp/b1f_325_URL-s143660317--http&c%%feedproxy.google.com%~r%mixotic%~5%urTIRWQK2OQ%Mixotic__258__-__Michael__Miller__-__Galactic__Technolgies.mp3.log.web:
    openBinaryFile: invalid argument (File name too long)

Is there a way to work around this?
