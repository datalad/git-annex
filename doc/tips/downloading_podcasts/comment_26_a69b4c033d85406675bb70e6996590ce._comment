@ewen importfeed already tracks guids, since 2015. Relevant commit is
[[!commit f95a8c867223b2e17d036d0d3377bf0fc9d3adff]]

You may well have an
older version of git-annex that didn't do that. But there are probably also
feeds that lack a useful guid, or that even make a change that changes the
guid of an existing item.

With `git annex metadata`, you can see the `itemid` which is where the guid
is stored.

PS, please post in [[todo]] when you have a request..
