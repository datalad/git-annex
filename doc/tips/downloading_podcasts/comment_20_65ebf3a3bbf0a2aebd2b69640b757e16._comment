The git-annex man page has a bit more to say about --relaxed and --fast. Their behavior when used with `importfeed` is the same as with `addurl`.

If the podcast feed provides an `itemid`, you can use that in the filename template. I don't know how common that is. Due to the way `importfeed` works, it cannot keep track of eg, an incrementing item number itself.
