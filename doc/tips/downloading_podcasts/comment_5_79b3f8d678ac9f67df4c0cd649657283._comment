Currently I have my podcasts imported with --fast. For some reason there are podcast episodes missing. This has been done propably during my period of toying with the feature. If I retry on a clean annex I see all episodes. My suspicion is that git-annex has been interrupted during downloading a feed but now somehow thinks it's already there. How can I debug this situation and/or force git annex to retry all the links in a feed?
