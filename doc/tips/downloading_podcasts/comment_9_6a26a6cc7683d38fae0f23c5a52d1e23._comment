Joey - your initial post said:

    git-annex must be built with the Feeds feature (run git annex version to check).

...but how do I actually switch on the feeds feature?

I install git-annex from cabal, so I do

    cabal update
    cabal install git-annex

which I did this morning and now `git annex version` gives me:

    git-annex version: 4.20130802
    build flags: Assistant Webapp Pairing Testsuite S3 WebDAV FsEvents XMPP DNS

So it is the latest version, but without Feeds.  :-(
