@joey - thanks, that's prompt feature request fulfilment :-)

Looking more closely at the duplicates, it turns out that not *everything* got duplicated, just the \"older\" episodes.  It turns out the newer episodes do have `guid` values saved (as `itemid` in the metadata) and the older episodes do not.  I think this is most likely because I *was* running a fairly old git-annex until about October 2016, on a fairly old OS install, but then upgraded to a more recent one (now about 6 months old) which does track them.  My assumption (without checking every file) is the episodes downloaded before October 2016 are ones that got duplicated.

I've edited the main page and added a note that GUIDs are tracked in versions since 2015, since I didn't obviously find that listed anywhere before.
