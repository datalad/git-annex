@ewen, I tested that feed and it is able to get the pubDate from it and
parses it ok.

Most likely, your version of git-annex is not built with a new enough
version of the haskell feed library. Version 0.3.9 or newer is needed to be
able to extract pubdates. For example, Debian stable doesn't have a new
enough version.
