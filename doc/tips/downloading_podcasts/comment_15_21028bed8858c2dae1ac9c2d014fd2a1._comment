It seems git-annex is a bit overzealous when sanitizing the file extension, currently I get: \"Nerdkunde/Let_s_go_to_the_D_M_C_A_m4a\" from http://www.nerdkunde.de/episodes.m4a.rss with the default template and only \"Nerdkunde/Let_s_go_to_the_D_M_C_A._m4a\" if I add the \".\" in the template myself...
