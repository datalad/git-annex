Like it says in the tip, `git annex add` will add the large files to git. You can add the small files with `git add`; git-annex won't do that for you. 

To automatically add both sorts of files, you can use the `git annex watch` or `git annex assistant` daemons. The latter also keeps files in sync between repositories automatically.

(Why did the picture show up as a new file in git? Because you hadn't committed it. This is the same as when you `git add` a file;
it's only staged in the index; `git status` will show it is new until you `git commit`)
