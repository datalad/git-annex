I thought I had the same problem as lh (`git add` not respecting the largefiles config), but when I tried to make a minimal example I noticed that `git add` does add files to the annex, it just doesn't print the progress message that `git annex add` usually prints.

Is there any way to get it to do that?
It would help newbs like me know that largefiles is indeed working and for files that are actually large it can be helpful to see the progress.
