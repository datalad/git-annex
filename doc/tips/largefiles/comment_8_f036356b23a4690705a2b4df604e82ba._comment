Thanks, joey.

Your last comment brought me onto the right track. The Problem was not in the repository, but an old stale global .gitconfig in my homedir. I just checked $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/git/config were currently my global git-config is residing and totaly forgot about this old config. Stupid me!

    git config --show-origin --get annex.largefiles

was my savior here as it clearly indicated that there is indeed a (unintended) config setting and where to find the file. So i can strongly recommend anybody experiencing strange behavior to try this one-liner. It might have saved me hours of time.

Thanks for your help! :)

Cheers
