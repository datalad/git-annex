Hi,

I noticed using the git-annex branch of gitolite v3 that the same URL with \".git\" at the end would not work in git-annex. For example my test repository was `git@git2.mildred.fr:u/mildred/Annex.git` but it didn't work until I converted it to `git@git2.mildred.fr:u/mildred/Annex`

On the server, the repository is in `repositories/u/mildred/Annex.git`

If I try a copy with git-annex for example, I would get:

    $ git annex copy titi --to test
    copy titi (checking test...) FATAL: u/mildred/Annex.git mildred DENIED
    
    (unable to check test) failed
    git-annex: copy: 1 failed

(test is the name of my remote and titi is my file)

Note, in my gitolite conf, I have:

    repo u/CREATOR/[a-zA-Z0-9].*
      C    = @all
      RW+D = CREATOR
      RW   = WRITERS
      R    = READERS
