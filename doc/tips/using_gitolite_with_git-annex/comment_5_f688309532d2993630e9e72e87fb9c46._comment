I guess there is some path rewriting going in in gitolite proper because if try a url of the form 
ssh://git@localhost/testing, then it still works with gitolite, but fails with the ADC because 
the repo is passed as /testing:
<pre>
Running: ssh [\"git@host\",\"git-annex-shell 'configlist' '/recommend'\"]
Running: ssh [\"git@host\",\"git-annex-shell 'configlist' '/recommend'\"]
</pre>

What I have to ask Sitaram and or find in the docs is if this is a bug or a feature in gitolite.  I can see how the leading slash would get swallowed up by this line 
<pre>
$repo = \"'$REPO_BASE/$repo.git'\"
</pre>
in gl-auth-command, but I guess that isn't the whole story.
