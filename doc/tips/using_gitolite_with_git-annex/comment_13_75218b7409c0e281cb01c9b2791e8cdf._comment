The steps to activate git-annex integration have changed/simplified for v3.


1) during install, be sure to use the 'git-annex' branch, rather than master[fn:1]. 

2) to enable git-annex-shell, open ~/.gitolite.rc and insert 'git-annex-shell' => 'ua' into the hash list in the COMMANDS array.[fn:2] 
#'git-annex-shell'   =>  'ua',
   



[fn:1] We'd like to have this feature-branch merged to master, so please send Sitaram feedback, positive and negative, based on your experiences.
[fn:2] There is no GL_ADC_PATH and no \"ua\" subdirectory here, and nothing to \"install\"; the command now comes with gitolite.
