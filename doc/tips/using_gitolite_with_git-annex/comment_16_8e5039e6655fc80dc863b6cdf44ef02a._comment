We have reached the same point as the previous poster from 25 days ago. 
$ git annex copy --to origin
FATAL: suspicious characters loitering about 'git-annex-shell 'configlist' '/~/testing''

  Remote origin does not have git-annex installed; setting remote.origin.annex-ignore
git-annex: cannot determine uuid for origin

Anyone actually have this working?
