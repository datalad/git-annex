I find out that I need to add the following lines to the gitolite.rc
in the server side.

'git-annex-shell ua'

The signal repository works with gitolite as expected.
However, the mirroring feature is not working for slaves.
When I do

git annex copy --to origin

The master server store the annex file correctly.
The file managed by annex is not syncing to the slave
mirrors at all.
