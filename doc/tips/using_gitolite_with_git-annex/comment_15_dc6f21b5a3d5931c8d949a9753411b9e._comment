The proper array in .gitolite.rc seems to be the \"ENABLE\" array, which it appears is parsed into the COMMANDS array in src/lib/Gitolite/Rc.pm

@Khaije

Using 'git-annex-shell' => 'ua' doesn't seem to work for me. The program still fails in src/gitolite-shell around line 163 (gitolite repo version b1d3c05):

    _die \"suspicious characters loitering about '$soc'\"
      if $rc{COMMANDS}{ words[0] } ne 'ua' and $soc !~ $REMOTE_COMMAND_PATT;

When I insert $rc{COMMANDS}{ words[0] } into the _die message, it shows up as \"1\" instead of \"ua\" as I was expecting.

When I manually set $rc{COMMANDS}{ words[0] } to 'ua' slightly earlier in the script, the git-annex-shell command gets run but it seems to fail to parse the result of the configlist command properly because then I get 

    Failed to get annex.uuid configuration of repository origin

    Instead, got: \"annex.uuid=\ncore.gcrypt=\n\"


I am actually about to give up on the notion of using git-annex and gitolite together. Maybe. I am interested to know if anyone else is having similar problems.
