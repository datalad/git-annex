my gitolite.rc is available at https://gist.github.com/khaije1/7609848

For whatever reason I've found this to be very simple to get working so I'd guess there's a missing ingredient somewhere. The combination of gitolite and git-annex is valuable to me so I'll add documents to the url above in hopes it will assist some people with getting the same value.
