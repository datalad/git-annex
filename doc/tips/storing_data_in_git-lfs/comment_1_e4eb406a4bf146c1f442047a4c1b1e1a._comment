Is it possible to add git-lfs capabilities to a git-annex, without using a special remote?

I guess what I want is, are there any reasonable instructions to graft the hooks so that this is possible:


	$ git init
	$ git-lfs install
	$ git-annex init

And you can alternate between something like below:

	$ git-lfs track \"*.exif_thumbnail.*\"
	$ git-annex add IMG_0001.jpg
	$ git add IMG_0001.exif_thumbnail.jpg

Obviously this betrays the scenario of extracting thumbnails from the EXIF header and storing them alongside, as another form of metadata. If there's a better workflow to this, that would be appreciated too.
