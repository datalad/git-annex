This sounds interesting. But OTOH I'm curious about upgrades from direct mode (which I assume will soon go away):

If currently I just use `annex add; annex sync --content` on a media repo, would that change to `git add --all; git commit -m whatever; annex unlock *; annex sync --content`? That is, will v6 require the manual commit step?

Also, when `annex get` or `annex sync` retrieve files from another repo, will there be an option to have the files unlocked by default, as in v5 direct mode?

(I'm kinda hoping for `annex init --thin` or something similar to the v5 `annex direct`, as manually setting config options is easy to forget.)
