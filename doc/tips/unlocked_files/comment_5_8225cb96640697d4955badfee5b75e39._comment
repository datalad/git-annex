My problem is following, I delete files from a directory over normal delete functionality. I expect this files than be really deleted, at least on that repos. so that the diskspace for it is free.

I thought direct mode or now v6 with addunlocked setting is the solution to that. But either with thinmode there is a hardlink still there or without there is a copy in the directory.

I would rather not have to use dropunused to get rid of that, it would be good if git annex sync or assist could just add this changes to the history. I dont care if that would be the last copy, that does not matter for me in that usecase.

I want:

1. access files (or hard links) not soft links
2. only saved space 1 time per file
3. deleted files give free the full space without usind drop-unused
4. files should be added/deleted in that repos, not only transfered from somewhere else.

Do I need therefor a special repos like web/directory/rsync or can I do that somehow with such a normal repos? as far as I understand even if I would use web with a directory as parameter it would not save the files normaly in that directory?
