@wsha.code, if you opt to use annex.thin, then commit a file, and then
edit the same file again and commit again, the older commit will be in
git's history, but if you check it out, the old content of the file won't
be available. This is very similar to what happens when not using annex.thin,
but later running git-annex unused and dropping the "unused" intermediate
version of the file.

Running `git annex sync --content` or just `git annex copy --to remote`
will get the thin version of the file saved on a remote, and then editing
it won't lose the content. But note that if you edited a file while it was
being copied off to the remote, the previous version would still get lost.

If these seem like troublesome behaviors, well that's why annex.thin is not
enabled by default.
