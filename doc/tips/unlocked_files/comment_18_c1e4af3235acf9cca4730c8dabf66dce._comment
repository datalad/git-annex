Hi,

Lots of gratitude for your work on git annex.

I have an annex repo with a default setting to unlock files. When I run `git annex add myfile`, I notice a change related to permission is added to my file in the working tree, which I need to further `git add` in order to get to a clean state. See below. 

Is that expected? I'm wondering if it wouldn't make more sense / be a better experience if `git annex add myfile` would seamlessly handle that permission change and add it to git for unlocked files, so I don't have to run both `git annex add` and `git add` to get to a clean state? 

Thanks.

```
$ git status
On branch main
Untracked files:
  (use \"git add <file>...\" to include in what will be committed)
        05 Tapestry.mp3

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use \"git add\" to track)

$ git annex add .
add 05 Tapestry.mp3
ok
(recording state in git...)

$ git status
On branch main
Changes to be committed:
  (use \"git restore --staged <file>...\" to unstage)
        new file:   05 Tapestry.mp3

Changes not staged for commit:
  (use \"git add <file>...\" to update what will be committed)
  (use \"git restore <file>...\" to discard changes in working directory)
        modified:   05 Tapestry.mp3

$ git diff
05 Tapestry.mp3 changed file mode from 100644 to 100755
```
