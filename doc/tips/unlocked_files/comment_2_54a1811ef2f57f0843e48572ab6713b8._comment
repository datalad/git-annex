Direct mode is not going away any time soon.

`git add` adds the file to the annex in unlocked mode, and `git annex sync`
commits any such adds the same as any other changes, so all you need is
`git add --all; git annex sync --content`

Whether a file is locked or unlocked is a property of the file, that gets
committed to git, so when you commit some unlocked files, they'll be
unlocked when they appear in other clones of the repository.
