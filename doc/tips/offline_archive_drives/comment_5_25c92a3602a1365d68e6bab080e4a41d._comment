This is like the "archive" group, but you want 3 different ones. 
git-annex already has a built-in "smallarchive" group that is not
quite what you want (see [[preferred_content/standard_groups]]), so
let's call them "archive1", "archive2", and "archive3".

Configure the groups like this, so any member of a group wants to contain a file
only if it will be the only member of the group to contain a copy.

	git annex groupwanted archive1 "not copies=archive1:1"
	git annex groupwanted archive2 "not copies=archive2:1"
	git annex groupwanted archive3 "not copies=archive3:1"

Then use `git-annex group` to put  to put each drive's repository in its
respective group, and set `wanted` to "standard" to make it use the
groupwanted expression. For example:

	git-annex group bigdrive archive1
	git-annex wanted bigdrive standard

Then, `git-annex copy --to bigdrive --auto` and other similar commands
with `--auto` (or `git-annex sync --content`) will distribute files to the
drives.
