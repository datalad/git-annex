The only time git-annex will complain about being unable to lock down a file on
a remote is when you are dropping a file from a special remote, and the only
copy is in another special remote.

	drop foo (from dirremote...) (unsafe)
	  Unable to lock down 1 copy of file necessary to safely drop it.
	
	  These remotes do not support locking: otherdirremote

	  (Use --force to override this check, or adjust numcopies.)

In that situation, you can either use `--force` or `git-annex get` the file,
then drop from the remote, and then drop the file from the local repository.
The latter avoids any possible concurrency problems, but `--force` is of
course faster, and would be fine in your situation.

Dropping a file from a local repository that is present in a special remote
does not have this problem.
