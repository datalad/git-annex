Thanks Joey for your clear and comprehensive answer.

Quoting a part of your answer:

> and set wanted to \"standard\" to make it use the groupwanted expression.

According to the documentation the \"standard\" groupwanted expression only allows to use the predefined expressions, so I assume that the groupwanted expression shall be set to \"groupwanted\" instead:

    git-annex wanted bigdrive groupwanted
