Using offline drives as remotes makes it easy to enable encryption. I can rely on git-annex to encrypt the annexed files instead of setting up block device or file system encryption. The git repo does not need to be cloned to the drive.

Can I move annexed files out of my laptop and into archival drives only?
I have multiple drives plugged in via USB to store multiple copies. 
But it seems git-annex doesn't consider it safe because copies can't be locked down with directory remotes?
I'm only moving files into these drives by invoking one instance of git-annex, I'm pretty sure files won't be concurrently removed from the drives.
Can I move the files without entirely disabling all safety checks?
