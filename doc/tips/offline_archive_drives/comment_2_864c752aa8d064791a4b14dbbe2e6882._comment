Is the feature \"git-annex copy --auto --to usb\" working?
I have created a backup repo on my usb drive but when I call \"git-annex copy --auto --to usb\" nothing happens.

I have called \"git annex group usb backup\" and \"git annex sync usb\" to set up the repo.

What is the correct way to get the data out to the backup repo?

Best regards, Georg
