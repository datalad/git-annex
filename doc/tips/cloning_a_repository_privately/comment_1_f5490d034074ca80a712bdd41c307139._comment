The instructions indicate that `annex.private` should be set in the local repository configuration.

However, the following approach is also a possibility:

```
❯ mkdir priv
❯ cd priv
❯ git init
Initialized empty Git repository in /tmp/priv/.git/

❯ git -c annex.private=1 annex init
init  ok

❯ ls .git/annex/journal-private
uuid.log

❯ cat .git/config
[core]
        repositoryformatversion = 0
        filemode = true
        bare = false
        logallrefupdates = true
[annex]
        uuid = 955373ac-6044-493e-a696-1a706437b542
        version = 10
[filter \"annex\"]
        smudge = git-annex smudge -- %f
        clean = git-annex smudge --clean -- %f
        process = git-annex filter-process
```

It seems this repository was in private mode when it was initialized (expected). What is the implication of the switch not being permanent in the config? And by extension: what are the implications of removing the switch later in the lifetime of a repository clone?
