Oh good question!

This gets a tiny bit into internals, but `.git/annex/journal-private/` is
where the private information is stored. If you move the files from there
into `.git/annex/journal/`, they will be committed on the next run of
git-annex.

You would need to take care to avoid overwriting any existing files in the
journal, usually there won't be any though.

Also unset annex.private of course.
