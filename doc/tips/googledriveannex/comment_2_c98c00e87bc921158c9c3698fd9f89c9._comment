Hi,

I am new to git-annex and I want to use google drive as remote but I can't.

I create syslink to `googledriveannex` in `/usr/local/bin`.

When I execute below command, command waiting but not make anything:

`$ git annex initremote googledrive type=external externaltype=googledrive encryption=shared folder=gitannex`

`initremote googledrive (encryption setup)` # Waiting but does not do anything.

What I am doing wrong?

Thanks for helps
