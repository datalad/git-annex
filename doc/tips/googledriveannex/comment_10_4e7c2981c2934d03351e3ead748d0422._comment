I have not heard from TobiasTheViking in a while, unfortunately.

Whether this could be supported in git-anenx depends on whether a haskell

Google Cloud Storage might be a better option; it is supported in git-annex
via the S3 remote, as well as having an actively maintained external
special remote.
