Following the instructions above, when issuing:

    git annex initremote googledrive type=external externaltype=googledrive encryption=shared folder=gitannex

googleannexdrive fails and I get:

    initremote googledrive (encryption setup) (encryption key stored in git repository) No handlers could be found for logger \"oauth2client.util\"
    git-annex: You need to set OAUTH environment variables and folder and encryption parameters when running initremote.

Am I making some obvious mistake?

If not, I'd like to share my positive experience with git-annex-remote-rclone (<https://github.com/DanielDent/git-annex-remote-rclone>), which wraps rclone (<https://rclone.org>) that supports Google Drive: it worked for me.
