I have made a small script to fetch a specific set of songs from a
playlist. It just iterates through a [M3U][] playlist and makes sure
that git-annex has a copy of every file in the list.

Sample run:

    [1041]anarcat@angela:Music1$ ~/bin/get-playlist -p1 -v ~/playlists/Favoris.m3u
    git-annex: Bach/Unknown Album/Concerto for 2 Violins in D.mp3 not found
    git-annex: get: 1 failed
    git annex failed to get Bach/Unknown Album/Concerto for 2 Violins in D.mp3 (originally espresso/Bach/Unknown Album/Concerto for 2 Violins in D.mp3)
    get Groovy Aardvark/Oryctérope/05 - Téléthargique.flac (from marcos...)
    SHA256E-s26735079--13c04501b9c6fa5ddda02438484d569f4d3d9b1f0bcdd8740f3b927ab756c968.flac
         26,735,079 100%   10.00MB/s    0:00:02 (xfr#1, to-chk=0/1)
    (checksum...) ok
    Groovy Aardvark/Oryctérope/05 - Téléthargique.flac
    [...]
    merge git-annex ok

The source is AGPL and available in my
[personal git repository][]. Unfortunately, it is written in Python
and can probably not be merged into git-annex, but since it is so
specific, I figured it wouldn't be anyways. -- [[anarcat]]
