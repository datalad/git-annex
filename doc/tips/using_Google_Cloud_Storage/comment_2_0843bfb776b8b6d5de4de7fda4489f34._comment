According to the last comment, and this page:
* https://developers.google.com/storage/docs/migrating#keys

there's supposed to be a \"Interoperable Access\" menu option, something I can't find. Note that both the previous comment and this page refers to Googles old Developer Console.

I can find a few things under \"APIs and Auth\" => \"Credentials\" under the heading \"Public API access\", but no matter what kind of key I try to create I can't get anything other than an API key. No secrets here, and no \"Show\"-button for newly created keys.

Another thing worth mentioning is that these API keys I'm seeing do not like described in that first link in this comment. It's much longer, contains both upper- and lowercase and also contains dashes.
