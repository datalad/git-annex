I just found the \"Interoperable access\" thing. The instructions from Google (linked in previous comments) are not perfect.

After step 4 click \"Google Cloud Storage\", then at the bottom you have a heading called \"Interoperable Access\" where you have to activate it for this project.

Then it appears at the bottom of the left hand menu.
