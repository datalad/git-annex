Nice job bgilbert on the external special remote.

git-annex's S3 special remote also supports nearline now:

	git annex initremote cloud type=S3 encryption=none host=storage.googleapis.com port=80 storageclass=NEARLINE

For the nearline support to work, git-annex has to be built with version 0.13.0 of
the haskell aws library.

But, it seems like bgilbert's external special remote is easier to set up,
due to not needing to configure Google Cloud Storage for interoperable access.
