Let's say you want to distribute some big files to the whole world.
You can of course, just drop them onto a website. But perhaps you'd like to
use git-annex to manage those files. And as an added bonus, why not let
anyone in the world clone your site and use `git-annex get`!

My site like this is [downloads.kitenet.net](https://downloads.kitenet.net).
Here's how I set it up. --[[Joey]]

1. Set up a web site. I used Apache, and configured it to follow symlinks.
   `Options FollowSymLinks`
2. Put some files on the website. Make sure it works.
3. `git init; git annex init`
4. `git config core.sharedrepository world` (Makes sure files
   are always added with permissions that allow everyone to read them.)
5. `git config receive.denyCurrentBranch updateInstead` (Makes the
   [[working tree update when changes are pushed to it|making_a_remote_repo_update_when_changes_are_pushed_to_it]].)
6. We want users to be able to clone the git repository over http, because
   git-annex can download files from it over http as well. For this to
   work, `git update-server-info` needs to get run on the server after
   commits or pushes to it. The git `post-update` hook will take care of
   this, you just need to enable the hook on the server.
   `mv .git/hooks/post-update.sample .git/hooks/post-update`
7. `git annex add; git commit -m added`
8. Make sure users can still download files from the site directly.
9. Instruct advanced users to clone a http url that ends with the "/.git/"
   directory. For example, for downloads.kitenet.net, the clone url
   is `https://downloads.kitenet.net/.git/`

When users clone over http, and run git-annex, it will
automatically learn all about your repository and be able to download files
right out of it, also using http.

----

The above is a simple way to set that up, but it's not necessarily the
*best* way. Both git and git-annex will be accessing the repository using
dumb http, which can be innefficient. And it doesn't allow write access.

For something smarter, you may want to also set up
[git smart http](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-on-the-Server-Smart-HTTP),
and the git-annex equivilant, a [[smart_http_server]].
