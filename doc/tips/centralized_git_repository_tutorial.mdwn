The [[walkthrough]] builds up a decentralized git repository setup, but
git-annex can also be used with a centralized git repository. 

We have separate tutorials depending on where the centralized git
repository is hosted.

* [[centralized_git_repository_tutorial/On_GitHub]] --
  However, GitHub does not currently let git-annex
  store the contents of large files there. So, things get a little more
  complicated when using it.

* [[centralized_git_repository_tutorial/On_GitLab]] -- 
  This service is similar to GitHub, but supports
  git-annex.

* [[centralized_git_repository_tutorial/On_your_own_server]] --
  use any unix system with ssh and git and git-annex installed.
  A VPS, a home server, etc.
