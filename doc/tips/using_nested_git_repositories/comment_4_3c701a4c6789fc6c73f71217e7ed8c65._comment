Submodules can feel a bit clunky, that's right. They're 'invisible to the parent repo' in that they indeed have separate configs (remotes, etc.), so one needs to manually set it up again when replicating.

DataLad embraces this and provides e.g. `datalad save`, which commits recursively into all submodules and it will also initialize and handle submodules a bit more automatic. But it lacks the fully bidirectional `git annex sync|assist`.

I use submodules extensively and am not entirely happy with it due to the fragile manual config necessary.

Auto-enabled special remotes can help out a bit (those will be configured upon first submodule creation by git annex).
