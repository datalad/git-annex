It seems to be that git has gotten smarter and now actively prevents you from adding a `.git` folder (I did this many years ago when before I learned about submodules); I'd like to do something like the following:
```bash
git init --separate-git-dir=.gitannex .
git --git-dir=.gitannex annex init
git clone some_repo # A repo I'm pulling from GitHub/wherever and don't want a submodule of as it's not my personal project
git --git-dir=.gitannex add some_repo
```

Essentially, I can override that `.git` folder name, but it still checks for other `.git` folders; is there a way to remove this check?
