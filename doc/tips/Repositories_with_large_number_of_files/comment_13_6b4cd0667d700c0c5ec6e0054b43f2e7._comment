You may try the following: Set the preferred-content expression for the repo to just `present` or `anything` and then run `git annex sync --content --all`. This allows git-annex to use a optimization and should run faster. Don't use `--jobs` and unset `annex.jobs` git config, since these slow the optimization down a bit in my experience (note that just specifying `--jobs=1` is not the same AFAIK).

See also [[todo/Incremental\_git\_annex\_sync\_--content\_--all]]

Using unlocked files will slow down things in general, but from your description it doesn't sound like that's the issue here.
