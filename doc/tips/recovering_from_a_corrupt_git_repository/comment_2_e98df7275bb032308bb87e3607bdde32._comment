I am using git-annex 20131106 and I tried `git annex repair` first. It seems git is making assumptions that if I have object A then I must have object B that A depends on. Or maybe it freaks out because the object is not missing, just full of zeroes. I haven't done any analysis on exactly what situation causes this. When I have time, I will.
