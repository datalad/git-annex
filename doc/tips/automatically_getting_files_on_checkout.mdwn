Normally git-annex does not retrieve file contents when checking out a
tree. In some use cases, it makes sense to always have the contents of
files available after a `git checkout` or `git update`. This can be
accomplished by installing the following as `.git/hooks/post-checkout`

	#!/bin/sh
	# Uses git-annex to get all files in the specified directories
	# (relative to the top of the repository) on checkout.
	dirs=.
	top="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)"
	for dir in "$dirs"; do git annex get $top/$dir"; done

By default, all files in the whole repository will be made available. The
`dirs` setting can be configured if you only want to get files in certian
directories.
