I've cloned a git repository through ssh from a server which I don't have root privileges. 
The clone command is something like:

    git clone ssh://johndoe@somedomain.com:23/home/johndoe/Downloads/gitannextest4/ 

I tried to enable the remote and I get the error: *Remote gitannextest4 does not have git-annex installed; setting annex-ignore*.
I had no success following the steps here. 

I believe there is an error in the last of the alternatives presented here:

    git config remote.annoyingserver.annex-shell /home/me/bin/git-annex-shell (does not work)
    git config remote.annoyingserver.git-annex-shell /home/me/bin/git-annex-shell (works!)

So, **annex-shell** should be replaced by **git-annex-shell**.

Hope it helps.
