Wondering about this:

    encryption=shared

I read what it means: http://git-annex.branchable.com/encryption/ 

But now I'm wondering how the repos which I set up via the assistant have been setup. when setting them up I only had the choice between \"encrypt all files\" and \"disable encryption\" so how can I check what settings my other repos are using?
