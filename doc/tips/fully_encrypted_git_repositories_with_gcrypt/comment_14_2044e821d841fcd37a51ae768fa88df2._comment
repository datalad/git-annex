@flabbergast, you seem to be confused about how git-remote-gcrypt stores its data. The data is stored as git commits inside a bare repository. That is why the instructions say to create a bare repository first. (I think it's also possible to use git-remote-gcrypt in a rsync mode where it just uploads encrypted files to an empty directory and does not use a bare git repository, but git-annex does not use it like that.)

Your mkdir and touch commands effecetively create a bare git repository too.

If you're having a problem, I suggest filing a bug report (not a comment on this page) with the full details. The examples show on this page have been tested, and work.
