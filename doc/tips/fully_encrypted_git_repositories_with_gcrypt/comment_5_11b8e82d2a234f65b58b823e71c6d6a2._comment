> How would you feel about adding a new mode of operation where encryption is simply based on a passphrase? We could symetrically encrypt the repository with a keyfile that's stored in the repository itself, protecting the keyfile with a passphrase which - if stored at all - would be stored on the individual computers, outside of the repository.

Isn't that what the regular shared-encryption remote already does?  Except it doesn't put a passphrase on the key, because anyone who has access to the local repo wouldn't need access to the remote one anyway.
