\"We could symetrically encrypt the repository with a keyfile that's stored in the repository itself\"

Then you would need to decrypt the repository in order get the key you need to decrypt the repository. The impossibility of this design is why I didn't do that!

It would certainly be possible to store a non-encrypted gpg key alongside the repository encrypted with it, but then you have to rely on a passphrase for all your security.

You should file a bug report for the bug you saw..
