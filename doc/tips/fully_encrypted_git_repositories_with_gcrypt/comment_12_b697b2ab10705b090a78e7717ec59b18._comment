@Peter, in your example, it *is* going to use your gpg key to encrypt files. gpg is being used to generate a 256 bit random value (not a key), which will be used as a random seed for HMAC scrambling of the keys stored in the encrypted special remote.

If that's taking too long to generate for your liking, you can pass --fast, which will make gpg use /dev/urandom to generate it rather than /dev/random.
