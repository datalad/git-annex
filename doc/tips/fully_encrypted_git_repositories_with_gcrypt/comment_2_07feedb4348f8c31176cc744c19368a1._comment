I'm answering to myself :-). A possible solution to the annoying pass phrase asking with current gnupg is to use a specialized secret keyring. One first exports the secret key used for this repository in a specific keyring as follows:

`gpg --export-secret-keys keyid | gpg --import --no-default-keyring --secret-keyring mygitannexsecret.gpg`

This will create a keyring in $HOME/.gnupg with only the specific key. 

Then, in the git-remote-gcrypt shell script, gpg should be called as follows 

`gpg --no-default-keyring --secret-keyring mygitannexsecret.gpg -q -d ...`

when decrypting the manifest in order to try only the specific key. This behavior can be easily triggered via some git configuration variable.

Any comment?
