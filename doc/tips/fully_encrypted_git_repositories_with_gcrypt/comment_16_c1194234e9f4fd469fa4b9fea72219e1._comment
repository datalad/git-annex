I'm having a problem generating a proper annex map where one of the remotes is gcrypt. Specifically, the map command fails as per below. I will concede that it's not clear though if the failure is that of encryptedown, or the third and final remote dsown, which is an rsync one.

jonas@silk:~/own$ git annex map
map /home/jonas/own ok
map encryptedown 
failed
jonas@silk:~/own$ git annex info encryptedown
remote: encryptedown
