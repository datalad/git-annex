Sorry, I ment that the file containing the symmetric encryption key should obviously not be used to encrypt itself, it would be stored in the repository \"unencrypted\" (but protected with a passphrase)

Exactly. I think such a mode be a great addition. It might not be as secure as encryption based on a private key - depending on the passphrase strength -, but it would certainly be a lot more convenient and portable (and still much more secure than the shared encryption method).
