If you're worried about lost+found containing non-annexed content, you can
copy (`cp`) the files, rather than moving them (`mv`). After adding the
files, `git annex unused` will find any non-annexed ones that were added,
and they can then be removed.

This tip was written before `git annex reinject --known` existed, but that
is also a good way to do it.
