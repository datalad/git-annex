This procedure is also very useful when you accidentally rename files in the object dir.

Such a case occurred to me when I 'detoxed' a git-annex: detox renames files and it substitutes \"--\" with \"-\", thus destroying my annex.

I find git-annex very elegant in this situation: rather than trying to rename back the files (objects) you just re-add them (since content is still there unmodified) recreating the symlink targets!

Kudos!
