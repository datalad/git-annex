    git annex add recovered-content

lost+found does not contain only annexed file, right? It may contain any kind of file not originally annexed.

Examples:

* a file that was imported in the regular git part of the git annex repository
* a corrupted variant of an annexed file
* a git pack, a git index or any git administrative file
* a file totally unrelated that happened to be on the same filesystem.

In all these cases, this command will result in new additions to the annex.

This is not what a recovery should do, is it?

Shouldn't that become rather something like:

    git annex reinject --known
