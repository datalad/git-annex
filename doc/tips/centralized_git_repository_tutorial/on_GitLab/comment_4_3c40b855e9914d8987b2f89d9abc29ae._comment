@ovidiu, this tutorial is about setting up GitLab as a remote using
git-annex at the command line. The steps given here should work.

You're trying to use GitLab from the git-annex assistant. The first
version that supported that was version 5.20150731. I guess you might have
been trying to use an older version. Or encountered some other problem
which is offtopic to this page. If you have a problem, file a bug report
with full details about the version of git-annex you used and what you did.
