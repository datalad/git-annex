Hi Joey,

thanks for tutorial with the centralized repo. I am currently trying to set up a central bare repo for two clients (they cannot communicate directly with each other). I am not sure if I am pushing/pulling the right way.

On the server I did:

    git init --bare
    git annex init origin

On CÄºient Alice (I want to give Bob a chance get call \"git annex get\" from \"origin\"):

    git clone ssh://tktest@192.168.56.104/~/annex .
    git annex init Alice
    git annex merge
    git annex add .
    git commit -a -m \"Added tutorial\"
    git push origin master git-annex
    git annex copy . --to origin

On Client Bob I have called \"clone, init, merge, add, push, copy\" also.

Now the tricky part - do I have to call \"git annex sync\" at Alice's side to get the updates from Bob over origin?
I ran into troubles if I called \"copy --to origin\" before \"git push origin master git-annex\". How can I resolve a non-fast-forware on the git-annex branch?
Some notes about how to sync over a central bare repo would be nice here =)

Thanks a lot, Georg
