git-annex sets up its own ssh connection caching because this makes it a
lot faster.

To disable this feature, you can set annex.sshcaching=false, or set
remote.origin.annex-ssh-options as you have.

git-annex has no way to know if you have another ssh socket to use, so it
seems fine for you to need to configure it if you want it to use one.
