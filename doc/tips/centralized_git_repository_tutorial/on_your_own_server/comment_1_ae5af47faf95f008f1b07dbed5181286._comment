To avoid frequent typing of pin + RSA passcode + password,  we typically establish an ssh control master just once.   This works fine with regular git commands, but the git-annex command apparently try to create a different socket.  Even that would be ok, except that apparently it is a new socket each time we enter a command.

With sufficient \"-vvvv\" we see things like:  

    ...
    debug1: Executing proxy command: exec ssh -l fred proxy.xxx.yyy direct host
    ...

(Note I have eliminated references to the actual machine names and userid's.)

If the command had instead been:

     exec ssh -l fred proxy.xxx.yyy direct /home/fred/.ssh/master_host:22

everything would have worked fine.  In fact, we are now using:

     git config remote.origin.annex-ssh-options '-S /home/fred/.ssh/master_host:22'

and this eliminates the issue.    But it would be nice if git annex could somehow automatically use
the pre-existing connection.     Is there a better way to achieve this?
