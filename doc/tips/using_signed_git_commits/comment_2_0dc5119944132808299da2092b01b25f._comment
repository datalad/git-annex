It seems git-annex needs some way to verify that all blobs match its expected format for this security to be strong.  My histories have tons of huge binary blobs in them from when I tried upgrading to v6 before it was stable and got a lot of data committed raw.  I guess I need to rewrite my history to contain only verified blobs?

It's really too bad git hasn't upgraded to a newer hashing function by now.  They should make a plan to do that at least once a decade.
