Normally, pushing a change into a remote git repository does not update its
working tree. But it can be very convenient to only need to `git push`
(or `git annex sync --content`) to a remote to update the files checked out
there.

Git has a way to let you do this, by setting `receive.denyCurrentBranch`
to `updateInstead` in the remote repository. For example:

	ssh remote
	cd /path/to/repo
	git config receive.denyCurrentBranch updateInstead

Now after a push to the remote, its working tree will be updated.

Changes in the remote's working tree can prevent this update from working;
normally you'll want to avoid manually changing the remote's working tree,
and only push changes into it in this configuration.

When the remote is using [[direct_mode]] or
[[adjusted_branches|git-annex-adjust]], you need the 
[[git-annex post-receive|git-annex-post-receive]]
hook to be set up for pushes to update the remote's working tree.
This is a new feature in git-annex 6.20170217. If the remote was
initialized with an older version of git-annex, you will need to re-run
`git annex init` in the remote after upgrading git-annex.
