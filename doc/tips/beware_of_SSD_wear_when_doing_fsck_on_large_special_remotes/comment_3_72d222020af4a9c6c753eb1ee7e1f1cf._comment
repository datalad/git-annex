A nice feature would be to perform the `fsck` on the (encrypted) remote itself, as it would avoid to clutter either the network or the tmpdir. However, that requires some changes in git-annex's backend. Indeed it would no longer be enough to store a single digest per (plain) file: a new digest needs to be stored for each encrypted copy. It is not necessarily a big deal, but the backend would need to be reorganized carefully.
