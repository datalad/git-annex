If .git/annex/tmp is a symlink to another fs, then adding doesn't work:

    add file1.jpg (checksum...) 
    git-annex: /path/to/.git/annex/tmp/tmp30148: rename: unsupported operation (Invalid cross-device link)

It looks like it would be good to have two types of tmp directories here, one for adding, another one for verifying (and that one could be redirected off SSD).
