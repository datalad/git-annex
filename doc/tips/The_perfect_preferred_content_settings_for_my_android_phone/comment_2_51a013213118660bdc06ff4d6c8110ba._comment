I've tried setting up my own phone in a similar manner. Unfortunately for me, I store my `*.flac` files in the same location as my `*.mp3` files. For obvious reasons, I do not want to copy these up to my phone. This, however, is not working for me.

    content PHONEUID = ((exclude=*/archive/* and exclude=archive/*) or (not (copies=archive:1 or copies=smallarchive:1))) and (include=keepass/* or include=Books/* or present) and (include=Music/* and exclude=Music/*.flac and exclude=Music/*/*.flac)

I still get `*.flac` files in the repo.
