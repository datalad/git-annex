Hook program for gitannex to use flickr as backend.

This allows storing any type of file on flickr, not only images and movies.

# Requirements:

    python2

Credit for the flickr api interface goes to: <http://stuvel.eu/flickrapi>  
Credit for the png library goes to: <https://github.com/drj11/pypng>  
Credit for the png tEXt patch goes to: <https://code.google.com/p/pypng/issues/detail?id=65>

## Install

Clone the git repository in your home folder.

    git clone git://github.com/TobiasTheViking/flickrannex.git 

This should make a ~/flickrannex folder

## Setup

Run the program once to set it up. 

    cd ~/flickrannex; python2 flickrannex.py

After the setup has finished, it will print the git-annex configure lines.

## Configuring git-annex

    git config annex.flickr-hook '/usr/bin/python2 ~/flickrannex/flickrannex.py'
    git annex initremote flickr type=hook hooktype=flickr encryption=shared
    git annex describe flickr "the flickr library"

## Notes

### Unencrypted mode
The photo name on flickr is currently the GPGHMACSHA1 version.

The real name of the picture will be in the description.

### Encrypted mode
The current version base64 encodes all the data, which results in ~35% larger filesize.

I might look into yyenc instead. I'm not sure if it will work in the tEXt field.
