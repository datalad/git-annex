I am not able to get full syncing working. It says \"syncing enabled (metadata only)\".
When I click on Actions -> Edit it says:

Just a git repository. 

This repository is not currently set up as a git annex; only git metadata is synced with this repository.

If this repository's ssh server has git-annex installed, you can upgrade this repository to a full git annex, which will store the contents of your files, not only their metadata.

When I try to upgrade the repository it does not work. The log says:

sh: git-annex-shell: not found

rsync: connection unexpectedly closed (0 bytes received so far) [sender]

rsync error: remote command not found (code 127) at io.c(226) [sender=3.1.1]

I'm using Version: 5.20140717 on the Linux Ubuntu 14.10.

Ssh'ing from Ubuntu to gituser@synology works fine and shows the git-annex-shell options

Any ideas?
