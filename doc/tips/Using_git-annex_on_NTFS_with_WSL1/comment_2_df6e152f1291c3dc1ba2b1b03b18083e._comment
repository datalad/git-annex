I have not had the chance to try WSL2, but I think that git-annex should
work on it more or less without any issues or anything special.

When the repository is on a filesystem that either does not support
symlinks, or where you will also want to be able to access files in the
repository from Windows outside of WSL2 without the complication of
symlinks, it does make sense to avoid locked files. 
`git-annex adjust --unlock` is a good way to make that be the
case for all the files in the repository.
