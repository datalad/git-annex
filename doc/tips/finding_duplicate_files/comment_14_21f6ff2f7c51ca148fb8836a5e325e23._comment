I think it is worth mentioning that in the script I showed above, the \"uniqueness\" key can be set to anything.

Just recently, I ran a de-duplication where I set such a key to be the key *and* the file name, making it remove only files that are the same, but don't have different filenames. As I have a lot of files without their proper filenames (e.g. recovered with photorec), this prevents me removing the version with the proper filename and keeping the recovered one.

Very useful (in my sorting-annex case anyway).
