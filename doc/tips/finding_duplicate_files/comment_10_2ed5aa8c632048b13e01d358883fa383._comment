I'm already spreading the word. Handling scientific papers, data, simulations and code has been quite a challenge during my academic career. While code was solved long ago, the three first items remained a huge problem.
I'm sure many of my colleagues will be happy to use it.
Is there any hashtag or twitter account? I've seen that you collected some of my tweets, but I don't know how you did it. Did you search for git-annex?
Best,
    Juan
