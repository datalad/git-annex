Is there any simple way to search for files with a given key?

At the moment, the best I've come up with is this:

````
git annex find --include '*' --format='${key} ${file}' | grep <KEY>
````

where `<KEY>` is the key. This seems like an awfully longwinded approach, but I don't see anything in the docs indicating a simpler way to do it. Am I missing something?
