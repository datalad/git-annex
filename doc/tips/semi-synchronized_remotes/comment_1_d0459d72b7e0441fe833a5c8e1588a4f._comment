Setting `remote.<name>.annex-readonly=true` prevents git-annex sync
from pushing changes to the remote. It also prevents any git-annex command
from copying annexed file contents to the remote, or deleting annexed file
contents. So I think it's ideal for this kind of situation.

There does seem to be room for configs to prevent sync from pulling/pushing
without making the remote fully readonly. For example, the remote might be
a source of content, that only knows about the files it added and not other
files in the local repository, so dropping files from it should be allowed
but not pushing to it.

So, I've added `remote.<name>.annex-push` and
`remote.<name>.annex-pull`.
