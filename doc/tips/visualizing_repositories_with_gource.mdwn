[Gource](http://code.google.com/p/gource/) is an amazing animated
visualisation of a git repository.

Normally, gource shows files being added, removed, and changed in
the repository, and the user(s) making the changes. Of course it can be
used in this way in a repository using git-annex too; just run `gource`.

The other way to use gource with git-annex is to visualise the movement of
annexed file contents between repositories. In this view, the "users" are
repositories, and they move around the file contents that are being added
or removed from them with git-annex.

To use gource this way, first go into the directory you want to visualize,
and use `git annex log` to make an input file for `gource`:

	git annex log --gource | tee gource.log
	sort gource.log | gource --log-format custom -

The `git annex log` can take a while, to speed it up you can use something
like `--after "4 months ago"` to limit how far back it goes.
