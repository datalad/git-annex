Is there a low cost web hosting solution that would support a public git-annex repo relatively simply with simple access to download the public files. 

I figure I could set up an Amazon EC2 micro instance and mount an s3 share, hosting the git-annex remote, but this is a lot of overhead for something that dropbox does with 1 click \"share dropbox link\"?

Any suggestions would be great!
