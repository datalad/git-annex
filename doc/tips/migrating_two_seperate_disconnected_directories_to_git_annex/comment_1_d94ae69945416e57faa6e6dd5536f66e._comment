This no longer works, here is a MWE to copy-paste (uses /tmp/{A,B}):

```
mkdir /tmp/A && touch /tmp/A/bigfile
mkdir /tmp/B && touch /tmp/B/bigfile
cd /tmp/A
git init
git annex init
git annex add .
git commit -m \"git annex yay\"
cd /tmp/B
git init
git remote add A /tmp/A
git fetch A
git annex info # this should display the two repos
git annex add .
git annex whereis
git annex sync
```

This fails with

```
commit 
[main (root-commit) e9435bf] git-annex in stefan@notebook:/tmp/B
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
 create mode 120000 bigfile
