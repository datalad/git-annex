I have data that has accompanying parity files.  This is supposed to add some
security to file integrity; however, it only works as long as the files are
available unencrypted.  In case of encrypted special remotes the existing parity files
won't be of any use if the encrypted versions of files get corrupted in the remote location.

Would it be worthwhile for git-annex to generate its own
parity files for the encrypted data in encrypted special remotes?
