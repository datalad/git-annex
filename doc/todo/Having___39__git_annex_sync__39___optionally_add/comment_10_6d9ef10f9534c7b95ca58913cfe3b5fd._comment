Implementing `git-annex assist` now...

A tricky point is, should it add files only in the current directory and
below, or all files in the repository? Note that the assistant can be run
in a directory and it will only add changed/new files in that directory,
although it can receive pulls that change files in other directories
(and will then download those files content).

OTOH, `git-annex sync` commits all changes, not only those in the
current directory. (The assistant does in some circumstanges commit
changes made outside the current directory. Its behavior is a bit
inconsistent in this area.)

So I think it makes sense for `git-annex assist` to only add files in the
current directory by default. (Of course an option like -A could be added
later.)

And while I'm a bit ambivilant about it, I'm making it commit all staged
changes, not only those in the current directory. As well as following the
behavior of `git-annex sync` and to an extent the assistant, it seems to 
me that if you run `git-annex add ../foo; git-annex assist`, you are
intentionally building up a commit that includes file "foo". The same
as if you ran `git-annex add ../foo; git-annex add .` ... If you're not,
and you care about what files get added in what commit, you can of course
commit manually.
