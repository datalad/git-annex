I don't think this can possibly become the default behavior, because plenty
of users will have temporary files that they don't want to add (and haven't
gitignored), or even sensitive files that happen to be in the same
repository that it would be a security hole level surprise for `git-annex
sync` to start adding, when it has not before.

For the same reason, `git-annex config` couldn't be used to make this a
default `git-annex sync` behavior. A local git config to enable it would be
ok.

It would would need to look at annex.largefiles, and add small files to git
directly.
