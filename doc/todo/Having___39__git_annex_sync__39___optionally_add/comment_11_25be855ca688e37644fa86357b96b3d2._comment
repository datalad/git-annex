Cool, joey!

I personally would like `assist` to add all changes in the entire repo by default. For beginners it's always a hassle to know what directory one is in and if one opens a terminal in a subfolder via a file manager, then run `git annex assist`, it won't sync all changes.

But I see that this would be inconsistent with `git annex add`... On the other hand, `assist` should help you easily sync the repo state without typing too much. One can always do `git annex assist .` for only this directory. A `-A` option is also an option, but effectively one would need to use it every time. As you said in the other comment - if you want more control, use the lower level commands. The assistant makes syncing a no-brainer, `git annex assist` should do so, too.

That the assistant can operate on only a subdir (do people do this?) itself is again an inconsistency then... A config like `annex.assistaddall` could be introduced, but meh...
