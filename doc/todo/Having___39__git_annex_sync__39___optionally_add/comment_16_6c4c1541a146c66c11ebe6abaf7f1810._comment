@ewen for the record:

I never suggested that `git annex sync` auto-adds new files by default, see [my comment above](http://git-annex.branchable.com/todo/Having___39__git_annex_sync__39___optionally_add/#comment-37c3eb24df11d85c07b78c0297447c45):

> Exactly, I also would never want git annex sync to do the adding by default - strictly as an opt-in configuration.

As `git annex sync` already had so many options for configuring its behaviour, I thought having one more that runs `git annex add` in the beginning wouldn't hurt. I never suggested changing `git annex sync`'s default behaviour. Purely opt-in. Same for the existing options like `annex.synccontent` etc.

Changing `git annex sync`'s default behaviour of now syncing content was joey's idea, not mine.

> if you want to implement new behaviour for such a fundamental command

There is already `git annex assist` to do exactly that. See above or the changelogs.

Just to clarify. Please read the discussions you're referring to thoroughly before claiming things between the lines. ðŸ™‚ 

Now back to constructive discussion.
