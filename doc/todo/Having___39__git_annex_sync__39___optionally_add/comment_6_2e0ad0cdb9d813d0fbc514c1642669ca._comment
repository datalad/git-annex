I also generally feel like `git-annex sync` was probably a bad conflation
of 3 git commands into 1 command when there could have just been `git-annex
pull` and `git-annex push`. The fact that it conflates several things makes
users think of it as just a big "does all the things" command, which makes
users want it to do more things.

It is not too late to split it up, and eventually deprecating it would be a
good path to making annex.synccontent default.

Update: Implemented `git-annex pull` and `git-annex push`, although I have
no plans yet to deprecate `git-annex sync`.

Update: I found a better path to transition to sync --content by
default, and have started that transition. `git-annex pull/push` sync
content by default already.
