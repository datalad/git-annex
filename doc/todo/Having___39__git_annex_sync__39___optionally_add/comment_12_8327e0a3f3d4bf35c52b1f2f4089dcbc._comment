I'm also not too happy with the inconsistency of assist committing all staged
changes and syncing all file contents, but only adding files in the cwd.

I suppose that consistency with the assistant doesn't really matter. The
assistant's behavior when ran in a subdirectory is surprising,
inconsistent, and undocumented.

So I'm going to change assist to add all files. Except when -C is used,
then only add files in the specified directory.
