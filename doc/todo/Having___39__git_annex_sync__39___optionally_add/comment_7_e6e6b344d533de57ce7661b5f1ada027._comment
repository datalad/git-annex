Cool, thanks joey! 

If you want to go as far as deprecating `git annex sync` (a huge change in habits for git-annex users if that one goes away), I wonder how adding the `annex.syncadd` config (a strictly opt-in consensus for users of a repo) is too much of a disruption ðŸ˜… But okay, you're the maintainer.

I still think that having **one command** that does what the assistant does, but as a one-shot manual step, would benefit git-annex immensely. I recently tried running the assistant on my SailfishOS phone (https://fosstodon.org/@nobodyinperson/110203412944552425) and realised that having the assistant running in the background all the time is not ideal due to e.g. the power consumption - maybe due to the permanent SSH connection to the remotes. I am now using a systemd service that basically does `git annex add;git annex sync`. Would be awesome and certainly good for the understanding of new users if there was a command that basically one-steps the assistant - This is something I as a previous Syncthing user was dearly missing: one-stepping the syncing to see what's the bottleneck/problem/what it does exactly, etc. If you'd rather put this into a new command, I'm fine with that, though I still think `git annex sync` is a perfect candidate also due to the name.
