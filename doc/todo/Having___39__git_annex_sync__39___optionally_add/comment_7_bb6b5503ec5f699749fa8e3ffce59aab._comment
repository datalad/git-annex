Brainstorming some names for a new command that is `git add -A` + sync...

`git-annex publish` kind of implies more exposure of local files to others
than just syncing. But it also implies sending data, not also receiving it.

`git-annex addsync` is clear what it does, but not very memorable.

`git-annex assist` has a nice analogy to the `git-annex assistant`,
which is close in behavior. Users who don't know about the assistant
will miss the analogy though. "assist" also suggests git-annex will take
care of everything, even more broadly than sync.

`git-annex share` also implies more exposure of local files than git-annex
sync, and sharing goes both ways so it's better than `git-annex publish`.

I'd be inclined toward `git-annex share` or `git-annex assist`, but welcome
better ideas.
