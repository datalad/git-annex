Why was I talking about batch mode here before? --json of course makes
sense to support for unlock (and lock). Adding that now.

And, to find the files that `git annex unlock` would operate on, you
can simply use `git annex find`, because that does not list already
unlocked files, and only files with their content present can be unlocked.
