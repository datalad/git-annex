`git annex unlock` only operates on files that are symlinks and link to
.git/annex/objects.
I don't think that `find` provides a way to check the link target
of a symlink, so you'd have to write a program to do it. I suppose
that `git annex find --locked` could be made to do that.

`git annex unlock` often has to make a copy of the content of a file,
which would be the majority of its IO. Only if you're using
`annex.thin` with v6 might it not need to copy the file, and then a batch
mode could speed it up. Are you?
