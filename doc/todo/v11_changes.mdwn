This is a todo for collecting changes that could lead to a v11 repository
version.

* Append to journal files even when annex.alwayscompact=true.
  This can make it a lot faster in some cases.
  See note in Annex.Branch.changeOrAppend.

  It's important that this only happen when no git-annex version
  older than 10.20220724 can plausibly be running in a repository
  after upgrading to the repo version that enables this. Depending on the
  timing of v11, this may need to be put in a v12 upgrade that is delayed
  some amount of time (eg 1 year) after v11.

* Finish the transition of git-annex sync defaulting to --content.
  A warning was added in May 2023 when it's run in a way that will change
  behavior. It would be good to wait until all git-annex users have
  gotten the version with the warning, and used it for a while,
  before finishing the transition. This does not need to be tied to a
  repository version change really, but it would be reasonable to do so.
