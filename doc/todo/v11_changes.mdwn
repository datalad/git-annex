This is a todo for collecting changes that could lead to a v11 repository
version.

* Append to journal files even when annex.alwayscompact=true.
  This can make it a lot faster in some cases.
  See note in Annex.Branch.changeOrAppend.

  It's important that this only happen when no git-annex version
  older than 10.20220724 can plausibly be running in a repository
  after upgrading to the repo version that enables this. Depending on the
  timing of v11, this may need to be put in a v12 upgrade that is delayed
  some amount of time (eg 1 year) after v11.
