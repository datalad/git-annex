Couldn't you use the existing info --batch for the same purpose?

batching find has the problem that it can output any number of lines
(0 for a non-annexed file, 1 for an annexed file, N for a directory). So,
the consumer has no way to tell when it reaches the end of output. So some
additional thing would be needed to indicate end of output.
