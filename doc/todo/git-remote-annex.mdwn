git-remote-annex will be a program that allows push/pull/clone of a git
repository to many types of git-annex special remote.

This is a redesign and reimplementation of git-remote-datalad-annex. 
It will be a safer implementation, will support incremental pushes, and
will be available to users who don't use datalad.

This is implememented and working. Remaining todo list for it:

* When git clone is used with an annex:: url that is for a directory
  special remote and is missing directory=, for example, it does
  not display any useful error message. git fetch does, but it seems
  git clone eats git-remote-annex stderr.
