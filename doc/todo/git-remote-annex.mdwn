git-remote-annex will be a program that allows push/pull of a git
repository to any git-annex special remote.

This is a redesign and reimplementation of git-remote-datalad-annex. 
It will be a safer implementation, will support incremental pushes, and
will be available to users who don't use datalad.

This is implememented and working. Remaining todo list for it:

* Need to test all types of pushes, barely tested at all.

* Support exporttree=yes remotes.

* Support max-bundles config

* Need to mention git-remote-annex in special remotes page, and perhaps
  write a tip for it. Also link to it from git-annex man page.

* initremote could optionally configure the url to a special remote
  to an annex:: url. This would make it easier to use git-remote-annex,
  since the user would not need to set up the url themselves.
  (Also it would then avoid setting `skipFetchAll = true`)

* Prevent using with remotes that are encrypted using a cipher
  stored in the repo. Chicken and egg problem cloning from
  such a remote. Maybe allow advanced users to force it?

* When the remote has no manifest, a pull from it should fail,
  while a push should succeed. Otherwise, it can be confusing
  to clone from a wrong url, since it fails to download
  a manifest and so appears as if the remote is empty.

* See XXX in uploadManifest about recovering from a situation
  where the remote is left with a deleted manifest when a push
  is interrupted part way through. This should be recoverable
  by caching the manifest locally and re-uploading it when
  the remote has no manifest.

* datalad-annex supports cloning from the web special remote,
  using an url that contains the result of pushing to eg, a directory
  special remote.
  `datalad-annex::https://example.com?type=web&url={noquery}`
  Supporting something like this would be good.

* It would be nice if git-annex could generate an annex:: url
  for a special remote and show it to the user, eg when 
  they have set the shorthand "annex::" url, so they know the full url.
  `git-annex info $remote` could also display it.
  Currently, the user has to remember how the special remote was
  configured and replicate it all in the url.

  There are some difficulties to doing this, including that
  RemoteConfig can have hidden fields that should be omitted,
  and that some, like type=directory, remove some configs
  (eg directory=) in their setup action.

* Improve behavior in push races. A race can overwrite a change
  to the MANIFEST and lose work that was pushed from the other repo.
  From the user's perspective, that situation is the same as if one repo
  pushed new work, then the other repo did a git push --force, overwriting
  the first repo's push. In the first repo, another push will then fail as
  a non fast-forward, and the user can recover as usual. This is probably
  okish.

  But.. a MANIFEST overwrite will leave bundle files in the remote that
  are not listed in the MANIFEST. It seems likely that git-annex could
  detect that after the fact and clean it up. Eg, if it caches
  the last MANIFEST it uploaded, next time it downloads the MANIFEST
  it can check if there are bundle files in the old one that are not
  in the new one. If so, it can drop those bundle files from the remote.

* A push race can also appear to the user as if they pushed a ref, but then
  it got deleted from the remote. This happens when two pushes are
  pushing different ref names. This might be harder for the user to
  notice; git fetch does not indicate that a remote ref got deleted.
  They would have to use git fetch --prune to notice the deletion.
  Once the user does notice, they can re-push their ref to recover.
  Can this be improved?

* The race condition described in 
  [[!commit 797f27ab0517e0021363791ff269300f2ba095a5]]
  where before git-annex init is run in a repo,
  using git-remote-annex and at the same time git-annex init can lose
  changes that the latter command (and ones after it) write to the
  git-annex branch.

  This should be fixable by making git-remote-annex not write to the
  git-annex branch, but to eg, a temporary journal directory.
