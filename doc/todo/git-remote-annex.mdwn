git-remote-annex will be a program that allows push/pull of a git
repository to any git-annex special remote.

This is a redesign and reimplementation of git-remote-datalad-annex. 
It will be a safer implementation, will support incremental pushes, and
will be available to users who don't use datalad. 

Work is in the `git-remote-annex` branch, currently we have a design for
the core data files and operations.
<http://source.git-annex.branchable.com/?p=source.git;a=blob;f=doc/internals/git-remote-annex.mdwn;hb=git-remote-annex>

I still need to do some design work around using the git-annex branch to
detect concurrent push situations where changes to the manifest get lost,
and re-add those changes to it later.

Also, it's not clear what will happen when two people make conflicting pushes
to a ref, the goal would be to replicate git push to a regular git remote,
but that may not be entirely possible. This will need to be investigated
further.
