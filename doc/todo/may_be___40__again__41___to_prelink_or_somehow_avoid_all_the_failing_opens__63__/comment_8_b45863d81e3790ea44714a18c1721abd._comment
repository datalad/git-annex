For details of the older todo, including some timings with and without
prelinking, see [[!commit c4229be9a7a2318ef71b9ae433bc14bf604c9caf]].

A ghc bug, since fixed, was causing it to look in IIRC, thousands of
unncessary directories per library. This todo, by contrast, complains about
less than 100 extra lookups total.

The way you run the shim does not put the bundled git in PATH. That kind of
throws off your results, because git, not git-annex is what links to pcre.
I was not actually able to reproduce your result of it finding pcre without
any failed seeks, but perhaps it ran a different git binary than the ones I
have access to. Anyway, that all seems like a bit of a red herring due to
that problem and puts your timings in doubt too.

Simply moving all the libraries to a single directory would cut down on the
failed seeking a lot:

	strace -f ./git-annex version 2>&1 | grep ENOENT | grep openat
	openat(AT_FDCWD, "/usr/lib/git-annex.linux//lib64/tls/x86_64/x86_64/libm.so.6", O_RDONLY|O_CLOEXEC) = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)

	[pid 481279] openat(AT_FDCWD, "/usr/lib/git-annex.linux//lib64/tls/x86_64/libpcre2-8.so.0", O_RDONLY|O_CLOEXEC) = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)

	[pid 481279] openat(AT_FDCWD, "/usr/lib/git-annex.linux//lib64/x86_64/libpcre2-8.so.0", O_RDONLY|O_CLOEXEC) = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)
	[pid 481279] openat(AT_FDCWD, "/usr/lib/git-annex.linux//lib64/x86_64/libpcre2-8.so.0", O_RDONLY|O_CLOEXEC) = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)

The /lib64/tls/x86_64/x86_64/ seems like kind of weird behavior from
ld-linux.so, I wonder if that's a bug on its part. The rest of the seeking
seems reasonable. I guess these extra 14 seeks are not a major performance hit.

But, that library consolidation does not seem to speed it up appreciably at
all. Timings were almost identical before and after. 100 failed opens, when
cache is hot, is just not that much overhead compared with the script's
overhead. I don't think it's even worth implementing the library
consolidiation based on this.

Running `git-annex.linux/git-annex version`
takes 0.060s. Compare with around 0.030s to run `/usr/bin/git-annex version`.
(Sometimes it runs in more like 0.020s, but not often.. Probably have to
catch the cache in the right mood.) 
So, runshell and the other 2 shell scripts have around
0.030s overhead themsevles.

(This is with runshell modified so `GIT_ANNEX_PACKAGE_INSTALL` is set.
IIRC the way the git-annex-standalone deb is built sets that. Otherwise,
runshell does an additional 0.060s of locale setup stuff.)

I tried putting set -x in all 3 levels of shell scripts and time stamping
the output to see what was expensive. This was a bit surprising,
because other than the abovementioned locale setup stuff, all the rest
of the set -x output happened within 0.000965s. Which is 30 times faster
than the timings above say it should be. Could be that the time stamping,
which used `ts`, is not accurate enough.

Anyway, runshell uses several unix utilities (and at least dirname is run
redundantly between the git-annex script and runshell), 
and there are 3 levels of shell scripts for the shell to parse and run.
Combining them into a single shell script would eliminate some redundant work.
Probably rewriting in C would be a bigger win.
