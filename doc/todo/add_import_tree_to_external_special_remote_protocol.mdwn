The external special remote protocol supports export tree, but not yet
import tree. There is a draft protocol extension in
[[design/external_special_remote_protocol/export_and_import_appendix]].

My main concern about this is, will external special remotes pick good
ContentIdentifiers and will they implement STOREEXPORTEXPECTED
in a way that avoids race conditions (at least as well as git does)?
See [the original import tree todo for discussion about the race conditions](http://source.git-annex.branchable.com/?p=source.git;a=blob;f=doc/todo/import_tree.mdwn;hb=a9db0a505592bf7ee1db24c45b19ebbc96066a55).

Mistakes in these things can result in data loss, and it's
rather subtle stuff. --[[Joey]]

What I'd like to do is implement this in concert with someone who is
implementing a special remote that uses it. So we can iterate on the
protocol as needed to make it better. --[[Joey]]

I do want to implement this though, assuming it turns out to be feasible
for people to implement it despite its complexity, so I'm tagging this confirmed.

(This is probably a prerequisite for the [[importtree_only_remotes]] idea,
although it might make sense to implement that as a simpler protocol
extension.)
