If git-annex used pushInsteadOf for sending content to a remote, should it
also use it for dropping content from the remote? Dropping is quite far
from pushing. Does it make sense to expect the user to generalize "push" to
"arbitrary write access" when it comes to git-annex's interpretation of
configuration settings that were designed for git?

Granted, `git-annex push` can drop content from the remote when preferred
content is configured to.
