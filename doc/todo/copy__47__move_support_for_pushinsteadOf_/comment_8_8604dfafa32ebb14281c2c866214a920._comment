Maybe what's really missing is `url.<base>.annexInsteadOf`
corresponding to `url.<base>.pushInsteadOf`.

The same way `remote.<name>.annexUrl` corresponds to
`remote.<name>.pushUrl`.

You would need to set 2 configs, but the separation is clear.
And you could set it once in your global git config for whatever
servers you commonly use.

Another benefit to is that the new `git-annex p2phttp` server
needs annexUrl to be configured to a different url than the git url
when using it. annexInsteadOf would let that be configured a
single time for all urls on a given git server.

Update: Implemented that. Let me know if you think it solves your problem
well enough.
