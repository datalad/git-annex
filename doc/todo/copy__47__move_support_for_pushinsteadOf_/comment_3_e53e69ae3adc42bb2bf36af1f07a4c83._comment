But: If this change were made, it would risk breaking existing
working setups, that happen to have a push url that points to a different
repository. When git-annex was upgraded to use the push url, it would start
noticing that the repository behind the url has a different uuid than the
remote does.

For a ssh repository, that would prevent it from using the repository until
the user did something to fix the configuration. 

For a local repository, git-annex currently automatically updates the
cached repository uuid. It's not clear to me how that would work if there were
two urls pointing to two different repositories. Does seem like this would
prevent eg, getting files from the remote that it was able to get before.

I don't know how common such a setup with a push url pointing to a 
different repository might be. I think it is much more
likely that `remote.foo.pushurl` be pointed to some other url that is not
on the same server. pushInsteadOf is really intended to configure a
different access method for the same server as the repository url.
