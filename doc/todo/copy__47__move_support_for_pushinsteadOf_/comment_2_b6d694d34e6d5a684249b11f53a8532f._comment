As for `pushInsteadOf`, in 2011 this was considered
in <https://bugs.debian.org/644278>. And the result was that git-annex
honors `insteadOf` but not `pushInsteadOf` or `pushurl`. With the (weak?)
rationalle that what git-annex does is neither pushing or pulling really.

So it seems to me better for you to use `insteadOf`. Unless there's some
reason why you need git to pull from the http url rather than from the ssh
url?

Perhaps you're setting this up for many users,
some of whom are limited to read-only access.
Pulling from http would work for those users. And git-annex get
from http also works read-only the way your repository is set up.

If that is the reason you want to use `pushInsteadOf` rather than
`insteadOf`, it would follow that you would want git-annex to use
the pull url for getting files, but use the push url for putting/dropping
files.
