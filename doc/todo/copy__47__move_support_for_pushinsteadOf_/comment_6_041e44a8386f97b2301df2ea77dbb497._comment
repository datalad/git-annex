git-annex does not currently use pushurl, and making it start to use it
would be the same kind of potentially breaking change as making it start to
use pushinsteadof.

I get where you're coming from but just because a lot of people use
pushinstead of that way does not mean that other people don't use it to
redirect pushes to an entirely different clone of the repository.

[Here](https://github.com/git/git/commit/697f652818f211aa48e3c007f25d6177647980c1)
Junio calls using pushurl that way a "common mistake", so I guess he is
seeing people do that. He does have a good point that with such a
configuration refs/remotes/origin won't (usually) reflect the state of both
repos.
