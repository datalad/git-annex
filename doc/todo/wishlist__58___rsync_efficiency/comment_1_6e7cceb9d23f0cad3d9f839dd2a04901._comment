The `concurrentprogress` branch can already parallelize transfers.
It's waiting on some progress display improvements for merging.

I imagine this would keep the pipe full more consistently.

Although, ssh caching is perhaps even more important, since
it avoids a tcp slow start having to be done for each file
that's transferred. So make sure it's working.

Even with those, I would not expect git-annex to be as efficient
as pure rsync of a directory. git-annex's more general design mean
that there are more moving parts..
