I'm talking about a single file that the attacker already knows the content
of, and wishes to determine if it's present in the repository. That takes a
single scrypt operation, so scrypt's added difficulty is not relevant.

If the attacker doesn't know the file content, and is trying to hash random
values until they find one that matches the git-annex key, then a sha2 is
equally good protection as scrypt, because the amount of work is
computationally infeasible in both cases.
