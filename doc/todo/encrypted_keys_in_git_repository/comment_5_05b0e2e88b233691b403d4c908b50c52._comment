Ah alright, in that case scrypt doesn't help, I agree. Among the large userbase for such a versatile software as git-annex there surely are people that could make use of hiding the presence of some 'common' files from their public repos. Though it rather seems like quite an edge case to me 😅 Better go full-gcrypt in that case I'd say...

In that case, this'll be enough for my application, thanks! 🙏
