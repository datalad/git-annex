Hi,

First of all thanks a lot for implementing this feature!

I was trying to combine tag-filter with a path-filter, though it doesn't do what I was expecting.

## Case 1: When I filter by a directory + vadd tag then it kind of works

```shell
git annex view 'dir-a/dir-b/dir-c/?=*'
git annex vadd tag?=*
```

Notice: `_` (unset dir) is showing after running `git annex view 'dir-a/dir-b/dir-c/?=*'` command.
But I'm getting \"path too long\" on `10.20241031` in vadd.

## Case 2: When I do it like this (no paths too long errors)

```shell
git annex view tag?=* 'dir-a/dir-b/dir-c/?=*'
```

It produces something like this:

```
/tag-a/
      dir-c-child-1
      dir-c-child-2
/tag-b/
     dir-c-child-1
     dir-c-child-2
```

It does filter directories as expected except `_` (unset directory) is missing from the root and subdirectories.

## Case 3: it behaves 1:1 as case 2 (no paths too long errors)

```shell
git annex view 'dir-a/dir-b/dir-c/=*'
git annex view tag?=*
```

The last case should illustrate why I need this - I want to have a list of files limited by path `dir-a/dir-b/dir-c/` (which also preserve subdirectories in `dir_c`, which I also need), and then I want to group directories by tag INCLUDING \"unset tag dir\" in order to then assign tags to subfolders of `dir_c` (for those that aren't already have tags). But despite I specified `tag?=*` (notice the question mark), the \"unset dir\" does not appear.
