After closer inspection of the view described in the previous comment, seems like the content of `_` is NOT pure union of \"all except tag-a and tag-b\".

I was hoping that the content of \"unset dir\" will be `_ = dir-c-children - (tag-a ∪ dir-c-children)∪(tag-b ∪ dir-c-children)`.
Or simply `_ = (dir-c-children ∪ !(tag-a ∪ tag-b)`.

But what I'm observing is that `_` contains some dir-c-children that are also part of `tag-b` but not `tag-c` (`_ = dir-c-children ∪ !(tag-a)`).
