After fixing long paths and running:

```shell
git annex view ?tag tag=tag-a tag=tag-b 'dir-a/dir-b/dir-c/=*'
```

it does exactly what I need, and produces:

```
/
 _/
  dir-c-children-c
 tag-a/
       dir-c-children-a
 tag-b/
       dir-c-children-b
```

Haven't tried to use it with `tag=*` but for now it's even better as I'm mostly interested in `tag-a` and `tag-b`.
