As seen in [[forum/Not_enough_free_space]], pulling
a commit that unlocks a lot of large files whose content is present in the
repository can result in an unexpected doubling of the disk space used by
git-annex.

annex.diskreserve avoids that using up the entire disk, but it's not
uncommon for users to not have it set, and the 1 mb default can easily
be eaten up by other non-object uses of disk.

Perhaps 1 mb is too small for the default for annex.diskreserve. Even
10 or 100 mb would leave a lot more margin for other minor uses of disk space.
(Update: increased default to 100 mb)

Perhaps there could be another config like annex.diskreserve but that
applies only to populating unlocked files. It could default to some larger
size, like 1 gb. Probably most users are not going to want to populate
unlocked files when their disk space gets that low. Although, the same
could be argued about just getting files. --[[Joey]]
