Yes, probably it would be slower as it has to browse the history. `git checkout` works, sure, but it doesn't help if you want to have all old versions of a file in a directory for comparison. Is there git magic (something in the direction of worktree?) to do that? Or can git-annex produce a list of paths to all versions of an annexed file? Then a script could be written to make a poor-mans-`view --historical` manually. I guess one could manually parse `git log -p` or `git diff --name-only` somehow, but I have a feeling that this gets ugly fast...
