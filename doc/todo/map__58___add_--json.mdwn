In the context of exploring [solution for drawing a map of the clones](https://github.com/con/ceptualization/issues/1) I was reminded about `annex map` which I actually forgot about even if knew.

I think that if there was a `--json` flag with help of which I could obtain a more readily machine accessible data (not graphviz custom format) -- I, or someone else, could provide alternative renderings (e.g. mermaid) or extend upon.

Please let me know on how feasible that would be, and any other thoughts you have in relation to the [aforementioned idea](https://github.com/con/ceptualization/issues/1) so I would know how to proceed.
