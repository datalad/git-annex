Please take a look at [iroh](https://www.iroh.computer). It started as an IPFS implementation in rust, realized that IPFS is slow and overengineered and now pivoted to providing p2p connections with quic. 

* Peers/nodes/endpoints use ed25519 keys as identities.
* The iroh project hosts relay servers for initial NAT hole punching and as connection fallbacks.
* So far there are 4 initial [discovery](https://www.iroh.computer/docs/concepts/discovery) implementations: DNS, Local (mDNS), [Pkarr](https://github.com/nuhvi/pkarr) or Bittorrents Mainline DHT

I'm waiting for their [FOSDEM talk](https://fosdem.org/2025/schedule/event/fosdem-2025-6053-building-peer-to-peer-quic/). But there is also a good presentation on YT: [A tour of iroh](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AkHaIVuFHK4&list=PLvsg-fc7APc3TOrumoQdjggwoLTSfiqRE&index=2).
