The `genericp2p` branch now has what seems to be a fully working
implementation of this. I have not fully tested it because I don't
have a real git-annex-p2p-foo command to test it with. Still I can see the
remotedaemon handling connections, and also making outgoing connections
seems to work.

There have been some changes to the design, especially around how the
socket file is set up.
