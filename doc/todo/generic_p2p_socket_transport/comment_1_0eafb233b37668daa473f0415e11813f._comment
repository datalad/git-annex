I suppose this wouldn't have to communicate over unix sockets either, it could also use stdin/stdout like `git annex shell p2pstdio`, but without skipping authentication, instead using the `git annex p2p` pairing process. Something like socat could then be used to connect those stdin/stdout's to a unix socket, tcp port, or whatever else.
