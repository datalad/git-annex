my 1c: since `git-annex` is pretty much following git's own `git-remote-` paradigm here, I think it is ok to require `git-annex-remote-` to even simply be able to check what are the available `git-annex` remotes etc. Providing a shim to pass through to some tool specific interface is IMHO trivial enough. And as you outline, such approach also helps to avoid a security concern.
