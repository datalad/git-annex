`git-annex sync` has been split into push/pull, but there is another split
possible: `git-annex sync --no-commit --no-pull --no-push --content`.

That is a mouthful, so maybe it could be a separate command? 

Also, such a command could be perhaps be more like `git-annex get/drop/copy`
in operating on the listed files or current directory and below by default.
Although that might make it difficult for it to handle sending files to
exporttree remotes, which sync does with `seekExportContent` which operates
on the whole exported tree.

What would be a good name for such a command?  --[[Joey]]
