When git-annex merges a remote into the git-annex branch, it uses
a CatFileHandle, making a query get the contents of each file in the
diff. It would be faster for it to use catObjectStream. 
[[!commit d010ab04be5a8d74fe85a2fa27a853784d1f9009]] saw a 2x-16x
improvement to a similar process.

Also, Database.ContentIdentifier.updateFromLog, 
Database.ImportFeed.updateFromLog, and Annex.RepoSize.diffBranchRepoSizes
each do a similar diff and cat-file to update information cached from the
git-annex branch into a database. (diffBranchRepoSizes does use
catObjectStream, the others don't.)

It seems like it might be possible to
make merging the git-annex branch do these updates in passing, and reduce
the overhead of diff and cat-file 4x. --[[Joey]]
