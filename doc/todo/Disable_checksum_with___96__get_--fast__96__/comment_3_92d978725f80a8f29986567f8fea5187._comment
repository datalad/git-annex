What you can recommend, which works already, is:

	git -c annex.verify=false annex get

As to adding this to --fast, I think some would be surprised if --fast
allowed bad data to get into the repository. And commands like
`git-annex copy --to` that do support --fast already use it to avoid round
trip checks. It would not do to make --fast for those commands also avoid
verification. And `git-annex copy` is very close to `git-annex get`, to
the point that `git-annex get --from` is the same as `git-annex copy
--from`.

So, I think it's better to keep this a separate option, and the -c option I
gave above works well enough I suppose.

With that said, you're the second person asking about this in an HPC
context this week. I suspect maybe you and @mih were working on the same
problem in asking about this? Anyway, since you both seemed to have
difficulty finding the way to do this, maybe it would be worth making a
dedicated option like `--no-verify`.
