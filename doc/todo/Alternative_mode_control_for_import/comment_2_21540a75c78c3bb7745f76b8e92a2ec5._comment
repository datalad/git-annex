Bearing in mind that I would have to *support* all of the resulting
combinatorial explosion, and that several combinations don't make sense,
or are unsafe, or seem useless, I think I'd rather keep it limited to
well-selected points from the space.

I've fixed the description of --skip-duplicates to match its behavior.
I don't know if there's a good motivation for it not deleting the files it
does import. I'd almost rather have thought that was a bug in the
implementation, but the implementation explicitly copies rather than moves
files for --skip-duplicates, so that does seem to have been done
intentionally. In any case, `--clean-duplicates` can be run after it to
delete dups, I suppose.

An implementation of --mode=Did,Nsid seemed worth adding at first, perhaps
as --reinject-duplicates. But thinking about it some more,
that would be the same as:

	git annex reinject --known /path/*
	git annex import /path/*

The first command moves all known files into the annex, which leaves
only non-duplicate files for the second command to import. 

The only time I can think of that this might not be suitable is if `/path` is
getting new files added to it while the commands run... But in that case
you can `mkdir /path/toimport; mv /path/* /path/toimport` and then
run the 2 commands on `/path/toimport/*`
