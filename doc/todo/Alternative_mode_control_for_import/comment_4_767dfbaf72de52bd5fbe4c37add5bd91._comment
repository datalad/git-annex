Actually, import --deduplicate, --skip-duplicates, --clean-duplicates 
are implemeted naively and do hash files twice. So it's
the same efficiency..

But, I just finished a more complicated implementation that avoids
the second hashing.

That does make the combined action worth adding, I suppose. Done so as
--reinject-duplicates.
