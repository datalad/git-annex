I've implemented onlyencryptcreds=yes.

Note that this bug needs to be addressed to avoid some foot shooting
with this new option: [[bugs/prevent_enableremote_changing_encryption]]
Since the foot shooting is no worse that previously possible foot shooting
shown in that bug, I went ahead and added this new feature before
addressing that bug.
