I think I was assuming that encryption=onlycreds would use the same scheme as
encryption=hybrid, so new gpg keys can later be given access to the creds.

It might be possible that someone would want the equivilant of 
encryption=pubkey instead. (encryption=sharedpubkey is the same as
encryption=pubkey as far as encryption of creds goes).

In future there might be some other, better encryption scheme that might be
desirable to use only for creds. Eg, something other than gpg..

An alternative to support such would be to use:

	encryption=<whatever> embedcreds=yes onlyencryptcreds=yes
