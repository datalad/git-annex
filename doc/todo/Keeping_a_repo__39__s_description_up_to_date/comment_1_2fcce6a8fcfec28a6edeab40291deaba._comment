I think a good thing to do if you plan to be moving a repo around is to
describe it with something that does not depend on its current location.

For example, suppose I am making a repo on a removable USB drive. I'm gonna
literally move that from place to place by plugging it into different
computers. So the default user@host:/mntpoint description is not a good one
for that repository. Instead I use something like "2 tb passport USB drive", 
or even better I slap a sticker on that drive and give it a real 
name and use that as the description.

I guess that someone who was moving a USB drive back and forth between 2
computers would not be enthused if git-annex started updating the
description after each move. Even if that prevented the 
description from being wrong half the time.

I do think that `git-annex describe --auto` is a reasonable idea.
