Note that `git-annex describe remote --auto` has a small problem 
when the remote is a git ssh remote, that there
may be multiple hostnames, the one that happens to be used locally
might not be as fully qualified as the "right" one. Or it may even be a ssh
host alias, which can't be converted to a FQDN.

For special remotes, `git-annex initremote` does not set a description at
all, and whatever hostname might be used for one is hidden underneath an
abstraction layer anyway. So it couldn't do anything useful for those.

So that limits it to local git repositories..
