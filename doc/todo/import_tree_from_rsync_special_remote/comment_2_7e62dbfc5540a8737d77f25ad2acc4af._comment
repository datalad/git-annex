I have ran into the same \"desire\" I think: to be able to `import` the read-only (to me) tree of DICOMs from a remote server reachable over ssh, and so that later on those who have a clone of the repository and have access to that server could easily `annex get` necessary load.  Am I right in my importtree-ignorant thinking that if `rsync` special remote supports `importtree` mode -- it would also work fine when I have only read-only access to the remote folder?
