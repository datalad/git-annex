It would be nice if a couple of additional environment variables to be set for hook uses.

In particular:

    GIT_ANNEX_DIRECT=`git config annex.direct`

and

    GIT_TOP_LEVEL=`git rev-parse --show-toplevel`


I've made some changes to flickrannex to allow the sub-directories above the uploaded image to be added as tags.  This change has been merged into trunk: [[https://github.com/TobiasTheViking/flickrannex]]

What I needed was both the environment variables mentioned above.  One is set as part of the annex-hook and the other I guestimate from the file path.  If it was set in git-annex it would be much cleaner (and accurate).  So...I think this info would be useful for other hook.
