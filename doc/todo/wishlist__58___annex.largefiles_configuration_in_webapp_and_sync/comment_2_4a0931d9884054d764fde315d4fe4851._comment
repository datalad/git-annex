That would be great!

> Putting it in the webapp would need some nice interface for constructing the underlying expression. Might be doable for at least simple filtering (ie, files larger than XX or with extensions .A, .B, .C). I tend to think of this as a setting for people comfortable with the command line though.

I could live with a simple filtering interface without too many fancy stuff. The fancy stuff could be done on the command line if needed...
