Separate options could be added, but I'm not sure they're needed.
git-annex only ever runs one of curl or wget on a given system.

Which one varies depending on what is installed (ie, it uses wget when
available and otherwise uses curl), but as long as that's
stable, you can just use annex.web-options to pass additional options to
whichever one it runs.

FWIW, --limit-rate works for both curl and wget, more or less the same.
