Thank you for your previous message here: [[/todo/Copy-on-Write__47__reflink_support_for_unlocked_files/]].

I indeed discovered it was done for Linux after I posted it, but macOS with APFS also supports reflinks, under the `-c` (clonefile) option, which does the same as the `--reflink=always` option on Linux.

The biggest problem is that there is no auto option, but in theory it’s possible to first try the clone option, and then fall back if it doesn’t work, although that would be inefficient. 

I can try to code something, although I am not that proficient in Haskell, or run test code if needed on macOS 12.
