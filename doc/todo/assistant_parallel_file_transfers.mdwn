Hi and thank you for an incredible piece of software and great work!

I've noticed that when I add new files to a repository and I have my USB drive connected, the assistant alternate it's transfers of files. And only transfers one queued file at the time.

file1 -->> Internet offsite computer
file1 -->> USB drive
file2 -->> Internet offsite computer
file2 -->> USB drive


I would prefer a logic where the assistant transfer files in parallel to my different repositories. I know that it might not be a good thing doing that with network accessed repositories, but when I have "low cost", locally attached USB drives it would be great if the transfers could be done in parallel.


Is there a configuration option for this already?
