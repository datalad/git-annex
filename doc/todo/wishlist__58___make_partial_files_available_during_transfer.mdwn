Imagine this situation:
You have a laptop and a NAS.
On your laptop you want to consume a large media file located on the NAS.
So you type:

    git annex get --from nas mediafile

But now you have to wait for the download to complete, unless either 

* rsync is pointed directly to the file in the object storage ("--inplace")
or
* the symlink temporarily points to the partial file during a transfer

which would allow you instantaneous consumption of your media.
It might make sense to make this behavior configurable, because not everyone might agree with having partial content (that mismatches its key) around.


So what do you say?
