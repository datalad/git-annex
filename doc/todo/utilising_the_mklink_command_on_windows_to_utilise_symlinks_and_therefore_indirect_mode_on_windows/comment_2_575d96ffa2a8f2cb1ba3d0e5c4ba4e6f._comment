Perhaps I understand this wrong. But if you're in a position to be viewing symlinks, then the file is in effect, locked right? So in the situation that a windows user is trying to edit a file that is currently symlinked, they shouldn't be allowed to save at all. They should have unlocked the file first, thus replacing the link with the actual file. A simple fix would be to have the symlink read-only just as the file tucked away in .git/annex/objects is.

As I said, I'm probably looking at this in entirely the wrong way.
