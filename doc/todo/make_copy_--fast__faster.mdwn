I was trying to copy files which failed to copy (3 out of 6,000) to remote host after copy -J4.  Succeeded.  But with subsequent runs, apparently even with copy --fast it takes annex 10 sec for annex to realize there is nothing to copy. git ls-files  which annex calls returns list immediately, so it is really some parsing/access to data under git-annex branch which takes awhile.  I think we had similar discussion before but couldn't find.  So I wondered to whine again to see if some optimization is possible to make --fast copies faster, especially whenever there is nothing to copy.
