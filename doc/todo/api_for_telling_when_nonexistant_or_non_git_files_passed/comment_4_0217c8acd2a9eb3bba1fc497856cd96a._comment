What should enable that new json output for exceptions, 
--json-error-messages or a new option like --json-exceptions?

The risk is that, since this is a new object type, it breaks a json
consumer that expects to find a `{"command":...}` object.

I do think that git-annex should be free to add new fields to existing json
objects. But adding a new object type seems considerably more risky.
git-annex has never done that before (eg --json-progress outputs the
"command" object with updated values).

I took a look at datalad's parsing of json from git-annex, to see what it might
do if it got a new object type unexpectedly. I'm not convinced it wouldn't
misbehave. For example, in `datalad/interface/results.py` `annexjson2result`:

    res['status'] = 'ok' if d.get('success', False) is True else 'error'

Without a "status" field this will yield "error" which could go on to
cause unexpected behavior

So, I think this would need to be a new --json-exceptions option.
