I see that datalad parses the error messages to get the filename that
caused it, and so an exit status is not enough information.

(See `./datalad/support/annex_utils.py`
`_get_non_existing_from_annex_output`)

So the additional json would need to include the filename that didn't
exist.

bpoldrack makes a good point
[here](https://github.com/datalad/datalad/pull/6510#issuecomment-1057320621):

So eg:

	{"exception":"UNIQUEID", "file", "foo", "error-messages":["foo not found"]}

That seems about right to me, and it future proofs git-annex to be able to
report other exceptions in json output later on.
