I see that datalad parses the error messages to get the filename that
caused it, and so an exit status is not enough information.

(See `./datalad/support/annex_utils.py`
`_get_non_existing_from_annex_output`)

So the additional json would need to include the filename that didn't exist,
perhaps something like this:

	{"file", "foo", "error-messages":["foo not found"]}
"""]]
