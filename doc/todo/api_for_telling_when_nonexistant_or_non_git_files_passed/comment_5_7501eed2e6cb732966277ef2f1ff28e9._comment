Yes -- having some UNIQUEIDs for errors might be quite great!

As for specific field to identify what that error applicable to: the other changed behavior which broke our code/tests was the change to behavior of `annex info` to no longer list unknown to annex path in `\"file\"` and rather list it in `\"input\"` for which the [PR](https://github.com/datalad/datalad/pull/7372/files) was cooked up already.  So may be here it also just should be `\"input\"` field if `annex` desires to not make claims on either it is a `\"file\"` or may be some \"pathspec\" (well -- in DataLad nobody was brave enough to open that -- path-vs-pathspec -- pandora box  [see issues/6933](https://github.com/datalad/datalad/issues/6933))?
