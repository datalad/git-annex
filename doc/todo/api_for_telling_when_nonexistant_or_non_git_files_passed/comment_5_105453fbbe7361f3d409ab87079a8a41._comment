I've implemented --json-exceptions:

	joey@darkstar:~/tmp/xxx>git-annex add dne --json-exceptions
	{"exception":"FileNotFound","file":"dne","message":"git-annex: dne not found\n"}
	add: 1 failed

Note that when a command like `git-annex get` is run on a file that exists,
but is not checked into git, `git ls-files` still displays its own error message,
so --json-exceptions doesn't help with this:

	joey@darkstar:~/tmp/xxx>touch foo
	joey@darkstar:~/tmp/xxx>git-annex get foo --json-exceptions
	error: pathspec 'foo' did not match any file(s) known to git
	Did you forget to 'git add'?
	get: 1 failed

Datalad will still have to parse the git output if it wants to know what file
it failed on in that case.
