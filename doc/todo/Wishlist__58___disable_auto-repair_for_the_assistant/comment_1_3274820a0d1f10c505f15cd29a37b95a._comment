What auto-repair are you referring to?

If you schedule a fsck of the repository in the webapp, then when that finds a problem with the git repository, it will be repaired. So if you don't want this, remove any scheduled fsck jobs.

The assistant also detects a few common problems at startup that prevent it from working, such as a corrupt index file, and automatically repairs those. These repairs only happen at startup. If the index file is corrupt, it has to delete it and re-add every file to the repository, which is expensive, but otherwise it would be completely non-functional.
