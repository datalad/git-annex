I'm referring to the large auto-repairs of the actual git repository, as mentioned in the bug report you are referring to. I was under the impression that the fscks also did the equivalent of 'git annex fsck' (which is greatly desired, even without the 'git fsck' checks). I realize it is a sort of workaround, but it is because the 'annex fsck' bit is desired, while the 'git annex repair' bit makes my computer unusable, the last time for over 24 hours, while it was running (at which point I needed to kill it and perform a manual repair).
