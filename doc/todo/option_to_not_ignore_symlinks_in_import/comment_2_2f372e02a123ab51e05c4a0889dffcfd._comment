I understand those concerns, but I think skipping all symbolic links is doing too much in this case.

I am interested in preserving symbolic links that point at other files within the same to-be-imported directory. I think this could be done safely by either resolving the symlink and importing the target file if it is a file within the importtree directory, or just importing the symlink as a symbolic link into git. I am starting to prefer the latter, and since it wouldn't import any actual file content it would even be safe to import symlinks pointing outside of the importtree directory.

This is what a small part of these datasets looks like:

```

```

I would like to meaningfully preserve these symbolic links when using `git annex import`. Right now these paths are simply missing after the import.

I think @Ilya_Shlyakhter has been asking for this as well in the linked bug report.
