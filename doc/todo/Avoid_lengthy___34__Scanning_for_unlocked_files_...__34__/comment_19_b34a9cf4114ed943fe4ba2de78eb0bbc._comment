It can't know if there are unlocked files without doing this scan.

Except for when annex.supportunlocked=false, but then that config option
would have the side effect of making git-annex *slower* at some point after
init, with the situations where it does hard to enumerate and probably
growing. This would be a hard behavior to explain to the user.

And there are numerous other points than the ones you listed where
git-annex accesses the keys db and would trigger a deferred scan. Eg, anytime
it might need to update a pointer file. Eg, when `git annex get` is run. 
Avoiding using the keys db when annex.supportunlocked=false in all such
cases in order to avoid the scan would be effectively the same complexity
as continuing to support v5 repos, which I've NAKed before.
