There was an unnecessary check of the current time per sql insert, removing
that sped it up by 3 seconds in my benchmark.

Also tried increasing the number of inserts per sqlite transaction from 1k
to 10k. Memory use increased to 90 mb, but no measurable speed increase.

I don't see much else that can speed up the sqlite part, without going deep
into the weeds of populating sqlite databases without using sql, or using
multi-value inserts ([like described here](https://medium.com/@JasonWyatt/squeezing-performance-from-sqlite-insertions-971aff98eef2).
Both would prevent using persistent to abstract sql away, and would
only be usable in this case, not speeding up git-annex generally, 
so not too enthused.
