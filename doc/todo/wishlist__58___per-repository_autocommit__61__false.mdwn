when using git-annex as a minority participant in a repository (eg. because in a hardware project, at some point in time, photos get added), users will start to need to `git annex sync` (because a plain `git pull` / `git push` will work but show errors, and a `pull --all` / `annex merge` is difficult for users to remember). to stay in line with usual git usage, the `sync` must be used with `config annex.autocommit false`, but that needs to be configured on each repository.

forgetting to do that explicit configuration results, in one sync command, easily results in an unwanted implicit commit that's pushed across remotes.

could there be a per-repository option (somewhere around .gitattributes, or maybe in the git-annex branch) that disables autocommits for the repository?
