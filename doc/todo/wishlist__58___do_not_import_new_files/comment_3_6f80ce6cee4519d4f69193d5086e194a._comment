>  You can use --clean-duplicates unless your goal is for some reason to add the duplicate files to your repository a second time.

My use case is that I clone an existing remote on a PC where there are already some of the annexed files (+ others).

My workflow would be:

* clone git-annex server:~/Documents.git
* git annex init \"other pc\"
* git annex import --skip-new (or --only-duplicates) ~/Dump/*

~/Dump contains many other files in addition to those found in the Documents repository.

In this case --clean-duplicate would not be the correct solution.
