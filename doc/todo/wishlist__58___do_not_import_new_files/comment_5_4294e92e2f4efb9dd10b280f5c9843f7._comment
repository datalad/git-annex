A fundamental problem with this idea is that git-annex's keys can use any of many checksumming backends. So, which checksum should it try? Running every possible checksum on a file is going to re-read it repeatedly and be expensive.

`git annex import` avoids this problem by using whatever the default backend is configured to be for the filename it's importing. This is good enough to make repeated runs of `git annex import` work ok, but when we get into trying to reinject whole directory trees like this, I don't think that's good enough.
