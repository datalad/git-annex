I was looking into why `annex get` and `annex copy` between local clones on NFS mounts don't utilize NFS4.2's server-side copy feature,
which would be pretty relevant for a setup like ours (institutional compute cluster; big datalad datasets).
This seems to boil down to not calling `copy_file_range`. However, `cp` generally does call `copy_file_range`, so that seemed confusing.
Turns out the culprit is `--reflink=always` which does not work as expected on ZFS. `--reflink=auto` does, though.
A summary of how that is, can be found here: https://github.com/openzfs/zfs/pull/13392#issuecomment-1742172842

I am not sure why annex insists on `always` rather than `auto`, so not sure whether the solution actually would be to change that.
Reading old issues it seems the reason was to let annex handle the fallback, which kinda is the problem in case of ZFS.
Changing (back?) to `auto` may be an issue in other cases - I don't know. If annex' fallback when `cp --reflink=always` fails would end up calling `copy_file_range`, that would still solve the issue, though, as NFS would then end up performing a server-side copy rather than transferring big files back and forth.

Just to be clear: It's specifically ZFS via NFS on linux that's the issue here.


P.S.: Didn't want to call this a bug, mostly b/c the "real bug" isn't in annex exactly (see link above), so putting it here.
