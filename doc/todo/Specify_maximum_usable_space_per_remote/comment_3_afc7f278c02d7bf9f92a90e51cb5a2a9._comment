git-annex repositories can all be clones of one another, but not currently
connected. They can stay disconnected for an arbitrary amount of time,
up to forever.

For example, /media/usb/annex can be packed up, sent half way around the
world and used with a different computer, which has no way to communicate
with its parent ~/annex on the original computer.

So, git-annex has to deal with split-brain and other distributed
inconsistencies. And it does. However, a keeping count of how much space is
used on a remote can't be consistent in these kinds of situations, unless,
as I said, the count is kept in sync using the remote in question, and not
information in the git-annex repositories.
