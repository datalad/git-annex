The publicurl config approach is more general; it lets almost any special
remote whose data can be published over http be supported.

So it can support a eg, a special remote that mangles key names in some way,
or uses an unusual directory hashing structure. Or even a special remote like
git-lfs that uses a different key than the annex key for storage and maps
between them.

By contrast, the generic special remote's approach can't support the
extreme edge cases, and is more ad-hoc, trying a few common path forms
that almost everything uses. But in its favor:

* --sameas already relies on special remotes using the same path form, and so
  it seems we're going to end up documenting which special remotes are
  compatable. That information could even be encoded in the remotes and
  git-annex sanity check uses of --sameas. 

  Perhaps --sameas is a slippery slope and this should not continue down it,
  but alternatively perhaps by encouraging compatability of path forms,
  it's a good thing. Although there are good reasons for different path
  forms. <https://github.com/DanielDent/git-annex-remote-rclone>
  has a nice overview of the common paths forms.

* If people start using some other protocol (ipfs, or ftp, or gopher, or ...),
  special remotes could also have their data published over it. It's much
  cleaner to just add a readonly generic ipfs special remote than, than
  it is to add a ipfs config to every remote along with the publicurl config.

  (Even if the implementation of the publicurl config and ipfs config
  is a Remote -> Remote transformer, there's cognitive load in
  having things like the directory special remote having a publicurl
  config, and the prospect of lots of configs for different protocols
  suggests this would be a slippery slope too.)

* External special remotes could be published over http and be used by
  this new special remote w/o needing a protocol extension and w/o
  needing the external special remote program to be installed at all.
  The latter especially is important if this is intended for publishing
  git-annex repositories.

Of course, nothing is stopping us from mixing the two. S3 and git-lfs
already support anonymous http access.
