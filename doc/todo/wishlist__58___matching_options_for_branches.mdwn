I have a repository layout where I have multiple unrelated branches in a single repository. Different branches have different policies regarding where their content should be replicated. It would be nice to be able to reflect this with git-annex's matching and preferred content options, but currently there seems to be no way to say "include/exclude files referred to in these branches".
