It won't send content that is otherwise not wanted just to satisfy
numcopies. Of course, like all commands, it refuses to drop a file if
numcopies is not satisfied.

Comsider a remote foo that only wants `include=foo/*`. And another remote 
bar that wants `include=bar/*`. And numcopies=2. If `git-annex satisfy`
was only able to access foo, and worked to satisfy numcopies, foo would end
up with files in bar/* that it doesn't want. But there's a better
place for those files to go, namly bar, which wants them. So over time it
would do a large amount of unncessary work, sending files to foo, only
to later drop those same files from foo once it was able to populate bar.

If the user wants to, they can configure foo to want
`include=foo/* or lackingcopies=1` and then `git-annex satisfy` will know
this is a repository that wants any files that don't have enough copies,
and when bar is not accessible, it will send its files to foo.

I think this could stand to be better documented. Especially since
things like `git-annex copy --auto` *do* work to satisfy numcopies in
addition to preferred content.
