It would also be awesome if there was something like `git annex synconlycontent --recent` or `--since=HEAD~10` or `--since=\"1 week ago\"` to just operate on the latest changed files.
In contrast to `--accessedwithin` this would look at the git history to check when files were touched. This is currently possible with something like `git diff --name-only | sort -u | xargs git annex ...` or `git log --since=... --format... | ... | xargs git annex` but it's far from convenient.

This might be a general new matching option for other subcommands as well.
