@nobodyinperson `git-annex transfer` is not bad. Although I was envisioning
this also handling dropping content from repos that don't want it, same as
sync does.

Well, I suppose getting a file from a remote and dropping it from the
remote can also be seen as a "transfer". Just because git-annex internally
uses "transfer" specifically for copying an object around doesn't mean the
command line interface has to.
