Average users could get so much value out of a simple and intuitive p2p file-syncing service that is as polished as [ResilioSync](https://www.resilio.com/sync/), provides revision control on arbitrary files like [Abstract (version control for designers)](https://www.goabstract.com/), but open source like LibreVault, SyncThing and SparkleShare. This would be priceless for science, design, all sorts of collaborative workspaces, and especially for backups and data redundancy. 

Currently, `git-annex` depends on Tor and [Magic Wormhole](https://github.com/magic-wormhole/magic-wormhole) to share/collaborate/sync with others. There is [Hypercore](https://docs.pears.com/building-blocks/hypercore) by [Holepunch](https://holepunch.to/), but [Named Data Networking (NDN)](https://named-data.net/project/archoverview/) ([video](https://youtu.be/qbAB0iN1-zQ)) offers a more robust internet backbone. 

Even better, there was an experiment for "[Distributed Git over Named Data Networking](https://github.com/JonnyKong/GitSync/issues/2)". Could NDN be used as the backbone for a built-in method for connections to be made for `git-annex` and set the foundation—pave the way—for the perfect file synchronization/sharing app?
