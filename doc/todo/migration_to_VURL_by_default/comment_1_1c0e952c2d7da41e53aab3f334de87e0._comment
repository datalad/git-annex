While a migration to VURL by default would be great, I think this issue when dealing with external special remotes should first be fixed: <https://git-annex.branchable.com/bugs/VURL_verification_failure_on_first_download/>. Right now, my datalad-cds extension does not explicitly set the URL backend, so it would break if the default was to change to VURL, but I would really like to use VURL with it if it was possible.
