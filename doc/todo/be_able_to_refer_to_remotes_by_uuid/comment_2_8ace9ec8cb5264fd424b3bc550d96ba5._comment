I've made `initremote` be able to be provided with a uuid=whatever
parameter to use whatever UUID you like.

Valid use cases include setting up two special remotes that access the same
data store through two different interfaces. For example, a rsync special
remote that is also accessible via a NFS mount as a directory special remote.

It can also be used when two unrelated repositories want to use the same
data store. Of course, dropping data from the data store then becomes a
problem, since one of the repositories will know it was dropped, and the
other one won't. Can get into situations where one of the repositories
was relying on its remote as the only place a file was stored, and so loses
the only copy it knows about when the other repository moves the content
from the remote.

For datalad-archives, I think dropping content from that special remote is
not supported. Which nearly avoids such problems. If so, it should be fine
to reuse some UUID for all the datalad-archives special remotes in
different unrelated datalad repositories.
