What it could do is with --remote=foo, check if foo claims the url. If not,
fail to register the url. The discussion in
[[bugs/registerurl_does_not_register_if_external_remote]]
is inclining me toward an option that works like that.

I suppose that --remote=web could, as a special case, force use of the web
special remote, bypassing any CLAIMURL. `addurl --raw` does the same thing,
but it makes sense to have a plumbing level way to do that.
