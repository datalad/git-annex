Note that git-annex does not store urls associated with any particular
remote. The url log is simply a list of urls. This was probably not a great
design choice, but we're essentially stuck with it.

So, `registerurl` can update the location tracking (which it currently does
only for the web special remote and not others). But an association
between url and special remote cannot be recorded by it.
