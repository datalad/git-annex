BTW, my first comment incorrectly described map's spidering capabilities
slightly. Suppose you have a remote on host foo, and that repository has
its own remote on host bar. Then map will ssh to foo to dump the git
config, find the additional urls on bar, and try to ssh to bar to get
the git config of the remote of the remote. And this can continue
artibtarily far, but limited of course by what hosts you can ssh to.
Whether that will be enough for your needs, I don't know.
