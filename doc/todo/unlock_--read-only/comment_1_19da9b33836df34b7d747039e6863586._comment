The protection offered by a read-only mode is pretty minimal; any program
that writes a file atomically using rename will bypass it. So, as programs
are implemented better, they'll bypass this "protection" more -- not much of
a protection!

Also, it doesn't make much sense to call this operation "unlock" if it's
intended to not let programs modify the files.
