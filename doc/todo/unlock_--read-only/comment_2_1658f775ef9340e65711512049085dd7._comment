Actually, yoh is right: read-only would be sufficient protection here.
Because, with annex.thin, the worktree file is a hard link to the annex
object, and the annex object lives in a mode 400 directory. So, even if the
file is deleted and a new version renamed into place, the annex object will
still have captured the old version.

Still don't like the self-contradition of "unlock read-only".

Of course, you can do this yourself:

	git annex unlock file
	chmod 400 file

So I wonder if there's any need for a git-annex command to do this.
