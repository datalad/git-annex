@Joey Please, I'd rather see the legacy import functionality still *saved* as a sub-command
that would have a new name than deleted altogether. You could de-emphasize this command
in the documentation and rather consider it like a plumbing command on the level of `git-annex-reinject`.
See my inline comment for further justification.
