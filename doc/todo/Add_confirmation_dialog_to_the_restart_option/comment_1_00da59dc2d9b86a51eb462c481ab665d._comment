Restarting the daemon should just take a second and the web browser should
redirect to the new instance. I guess it does move away from the current
page to the dashboard, and in a way that the back button can't undo, but I
see no other harm in accidentally restarting the daemon.

So, I think I'll just add a spacer to separate the repository part of that
menu from the daemon part.
