This is a summary todo covering several subprojects, which extend
git-annex to be able to use proxies which sit in front of a cluster of
repositories.

1. [[design/passthrough_proxy]]
2. [[design/p2p_protocol_over_http]]
3. [[design/balanced_preferred_content]]
4. [[todo/track_free_space_in_repos_via_git-annex_branch]]
5. [[todo/proving_preferred_content_behavior]]

## plan

Joey has received funding to work on this.
Planned schedule of work:

* June: git-annex proxies and clusters
* July: p2p protocol over http
* August, part 1: git-annex proxy support for exporttree
* August, part 2: balanced preferred content
* September: proving behavior of balanced preferred content with proxies
* October: streaming through proxy to special remotes (especially S3)

> This project is now complete! [[done]] --[[Joey]]

[[!tag projects/openneuro]]

## some todos that spun off from this project and didn't get implemented during it:

For balanced preferred content and maxsize tracking:

* [[todo/assistant_does_not_use_LiveUpdate]]
* [[todo/git-annex_info_with_limit_overcounts]]

For p2p protocol over http:

* [[p2phttp_serve_multiple_repositories]]
* [[git-remote-annex_support_for_p2phttp]]

For proxying:

* [[proxying_for_p2phttp_and_tor-annex_remotes]]
* [[faster_proxying]]
* [[smarter_use_of_disk_when_proxying]]

## completed items for October's work on streaming through proxy to special remotes

* Stream downloads through proxy for all special remotes that indicate
  they download in order.
* Added ORDERED message to external special remote protocol.
* Added DATA-PRESENT and documented in
  [[tips/client_side_upload_to_a_special_remote]]

## completed items for September's work on proving behavior of preferred content

* Static analysis to detect "not present", "not balanced", and similar
  unstable preferred content expressions and avoid problems with them.
* Implemented `git-annex sim` command.
* Simulated a variety of repository networks, and random preferred content
  expressions, checking that a stable state is always reached.
* Fix bug that prevented anything being stored in an empty
  repository whose preferred content expression uses sizebalanced.
  (Identified via `git-annex sim`)

## completed items for August's work on balanced preferred content

* Balanced preferred content basic implementation, including --rebalance
  option.
* Implemented [[track_free_space_in_repos_via_git-annex_branch]]
* Implemented tracking of live changes to repository sizes.
* `git-annex maxsize`
* annex.fullybalancedthreshhold

## completed items for August's work on git-annex proxy support for exporttre

* Special remotes configured with exporttree=yes annexobjects=yes
  can store objects in .git/annex/objects, as well as an exported tree.

* Support proxying to special remotes configured with
  exporttree=yes annexobjects=yes.

* post-retrieve: When proxying is enabled for an exporttree=yes
  special remote and the configured remote.name.annex-tracking-branch
  is received, the tree is exported to the special remote.

* When getting from a P2P HTTP remote, prompt for credentials when
  required, instead of failing.

* Prevent `updateproxy` and `updatecluster` from adding
  an exporttree=yes special remote that does not have
  annexobjects=yes, to avoid foot shooting.

* Implement `git-annex export treeish --to=foo --from=bar`, which
  gets from bar as needed to send to foo. Make post-retrieve use
  `--to=r --from=r` to handle the multiple files case.

## completed items for July's work on p2p protocol over http

* HTTP P2P protocol design [[design/p2p_protocol_over_http]].

* addressed [[doc/todo/P2P_locking_connection_drop_safety]]

* implemented server and client for HTTP P2P protocol

* added git-annex p2phttp command to serve HTTP P2P protocol

* Make git-annex p2phttp support https.

* Allow using annex+http urls in remote.name.annexUrl

* Make http server support proxying.

* Make http server support serving a cluster.

## completed items for June's work on [[design/passthrough_proxy]]:

* UUID discovery via git-annex branch. Add a log file listing UUIDs
  accessible via proxy UUIDs. It also will contain the names
  of the remotes that the proxy is a proxy for, 
  from the perspective of the proxy. (done)

* Add `git-annex updateproxy` command (done)

* Remote instantiation for proxies. (done)

* Implement git-annex-shell proxying to git remotes. (done)

* Proxy should update location tracking information for proxied remotes,
  so it is available to other users who sync with it. (done)

* Implement `git-annex initcluster` and `git-annex updatecluster` commands (done)

* Implement cluster UUID insertation on location log load, and removal
  on location log store. (done)

* Omit cluster UUIDs when constructing drop proofs, since lockcontent will
  always fail on a cluster. (done)

* Don't count cluster UUID as a copy in numcopies checking etc. (done)

* Tab complete proxied remotes and clusters in eg --from option. (done)

* Getting a key from a cluster should proxy from one of the nodes that has
  it. (done)

* Implement upload with fanout to multiple cluster nodes and reporting back
  additional UUIDs over P2P protocol. (done)

* Implement cluster drops, trying to remove from all nodes, and returning
  which UUIDs it was dropped from. (done)

* `git-annex testremote` works against proxied remote and cluster. (done)

* Avoid `git-annex sync --content` etc from operating on cluster nodes by
  default since syncing with a cluster implicitly syncs with its nodes. (done)

* On upload to cluster, send to nodes where its preferred content, and not
  to other nodes. (done)

* Support annex.jobs for clusters. (done)

* Add `git-annex extendcluster` command and extend `git-annex updatecluster` 
  to support clusters with multiple gateways. (done)

* Support proxying for a remote that is proxied by another gateway of
  a cluster. (done)

* Support distributed clusters: Make a proxy for a cluster repeat
  protocol messages on to any remotes that have the same UUID as
  the cluster. Needs extension to P2P protocol to avoid cycles.
  (done)

* Proxied cluster nodes should have slightly higher cost than the cluster
  gateway. (done)

* Basic support for proxying special remotes. (But not exporttree=yes ones
  yet.) (done)

* Tab complete remotes in all relevant commands (done)

* Display cluster and proxy information in git-annex info (done)
