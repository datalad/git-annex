This is a summary todo covering several subprojects, which would extend
git-annex to be able to use proxies which sit in front of a cluster of
repositories.

1. [[design/passthrough_proxy]]
2. [[design/p2p_protocol_over_http]]
3. [[design/balanced_preferred_content]]
4. [[todo/track_free_space_in_repos_via_git-annex_branch]]
5. [[todo/proving_preferred_content_behavior]]

Joey has received funding to work on this.
Planned schedule of work:

* June: git-annex proxy
* July, part 1: git-annex proxy support for exporttree
* July, part 2: p2p protocol over http
* August: balanced preferred content
* September: streaming through proxy to special remotes (especially S3)
* October: proving behavior of balanced preferred content with proxies
