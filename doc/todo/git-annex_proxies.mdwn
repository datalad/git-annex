This is a summary todo covering several subprojects, which would extend
git-annex to be able to use proxies which sit in front of a cluster of
repositories.

1. [[design/passthrough_proxy]]
2. [[design/p2p_protocol_over_http]]
3. [[design/balanced_preferred_content]]
4. [[todo/track_free_space_in_repos_via_git-annex_branch]]

## work notes

* `fullybalanced=foo:2` can get stuck in suboptimal situations. Eg,
  when 2 out of 3 repositories are full, and the 3rd is mostly empty,
  it is no longer possible to add new files to 2 repositories.
  Moving some files from one of the full repositories to the empty one
  would improve things, but is there any way for fullybalanced to know
  when it makes sense to do that?

  If this is not resolved, it may be better to lose the ":number" part
  of balanced and fullybalanced. With 1 copy balanced, this situation does
  not occur. Users wanting 2 copies can have 2 groups which are each
  balanced, although that would mean more repositories on more drives.

  Also note that "fullybalanced=foo:2" is not currently actually
  implemented!

* implement size-based balancing, either as the default or as another
  preferred content expression.

* `git-annex info` can use maxsize to display how full repositories are

* balanced= and fullybalanced= need to limit the set of repositories to
  ones with enough free space to contain a key.

* Implement [[track_free_space_in_repos_via_git-annex_branch]]:

  * Load Annex.reposizes from Database.RepoSizes on startup.

  * When Annex.reposizes does not list the size of a UUID, and 
    that UUID's size is needed eg for balanced preferred
    content, read the git-annex branch to get all repo sizes, 
    the same way `git-annex info` gets repo sizes. And store in
    Database.RepoSizes.

  * Update Annex.reposizes after each successful transfer.

  * Update Database.RepoSizes during merge of git-annex branch.
    (Also update Annex.reposizes)

  * On commit of git-annex branch, update Database.RepoSize to reflect
    the size changes in the commit.

    Probably cannot use Annex.reposizes for the values, since they must
    match the sizes in the location log files being committed. Note
    that other processes may journal location log changes, which will be
    part of the commit. So need to read all the changed location logs,
    and update Database.RepoSize accordingly.

    (Annex.reposizes can be updated to the resulting values.)

  * Perhaps: setRepoSize to 0 when initializing a new repo or a
    new special remote (but not when reinitializing),
    and also update Annex.reposizes for that uuid.
  
    Whether it makes sense to do this will depend on how expensive
    it is to update Database.RepoSize on git-annex branch merge and commit.
    If it is not expensive, will want to track reposizes from the beginning
    whenever possible, to avoid a later expensive read of the git-annex
    branch to calculate the reposizes.

* Make `git-annex info` use Annex.reposizes.

## completed items for August's work on balanced preferred content

* Balanced preferred content basic implementation, including --rebalance
  option.

## completed items for August's work on git-annex proxy support for exporttre

* Special remotes configured with exporttree=yes annexobjects=yes
  can store objects in .git/annex/objects, as well as an exported tree.

* Support proxying to special remotes configured with
  exporttree=yes annexobjects=yes.

* post-retrieve: When proxying is enabled for an exporttree=yes
  special remote and the configured remote.name.annex-tracking-branch
  is received, the tree is exported to the special remote.

* When getting from a P2P HTTP remote, prompt for credentials when
  required, instead of failing.

* Prevent `updateproxy` and `updatecluster` from adding
  an exporttree=yes special remote that does not have
  annexobjects=yes, to avoid foot shooting.

* Implement `git-annex export treeish --to=foo --from=bar`, which
  gets from bar as needed to send to foo. Make post-retrieve use
  `--to=r --from=r` to handle the multiple files case.

## items deferred until later for p2p protocol over http

* `git-annex p2phttp` should support serving several repositories at the same
  time (not as proxied remotes), so that eg, every git-annex repository
  on a server can be served on the same port.

* Support proxying to git remotes that use annex+http urls. This needs a
  translation from P2P protocol to servant-client to P2P protocol.

* Should be possible to use a git-remote-annex annex::$uuid url as
  remote.foo.url with remote.foo.annexUrl using annex+http, and so 
  not need a separate web server to serve the git repository. Doesn't work
  currently because git-remote-annex urls only support special remotes.
  It would need a new form of git-remote-annex url, eg:
  annex::$uuid?annex+http://example.com/git-annex/

* `git-annex p2phttp` could support systemd socket activation. This would
  allow making a systemd unit that listens on port 80.

## completed items for July's work on p2p protocol over http

* HTTP P2P protocol design [[design/p2p_protocol_over_http]].

* addressed [[doc/todo/P2P_locking_connection_drop_safety]]

* implemented server and client for HTTP P2P protocol

* added git-annex p2phttp command to serve HTTP P2P protocol

* Make git-annex p2phttp support https.

* Allow using annex+http urls in remote.name.annexUrl

* Make http server support proxying.

* Make http server support serving a cluster.

## items deferred until later for [[design/passthrough_proxy]]

* Check annex.diskreserve when proxying for special remotes
  to avoid the proxy's disk filling up with the temporary object file
  cached there.

* Resuming an interrupted download from proxied special remote makes the proxy
  re-download the whole content. It could instead keep some of the 
  object files around when the client does not send SUCCESS. This would
  use more disk, but without streaming, proxying a special remote already
  needs some disk. And it could minimize to eg, the last 2 or so.
  The design doc has some more thoughts about this.

* Streaming download from proxied special remotes. See design.
  (Planned for September)

* When an upload to a cluster is distributed to multiple special remotes,
  a temporary file is written for each one, which may even happen in
  parallel. This is a lot of extra work and may use excess disk space.
  It should be possible to only write a single temp file.
  (With streaming this won't be an issue.)

* Indirect uploads when proxying for special remote
  (to be considered). See design.

* Getting a key from a cluster currently picks from amoung
  the lowest cost remotes at random. This could be smarter,
  eg prefer to avoid using remotes that are doing other transfers at the
  same time.

* The cost of a proxied node that is accessed via an intermediate gateway
  is currently the same as a node accessed via the cluster gateway.
  To fix this, there needs to be some way to tell how many hops through
  gateways it takes to get to a node. Currently the only way is to
  guess based on number of dashes in the node name, which is not satisfying.

  Even counting hops is not very satisfying, one cluster gateway could
  be much more expensive to traverse than another one.

  If seriously tackling this, it might be worth making enough information
  available to use spanning tree protocol for routing inside clusters.

* Optimise proxy speed. See design for ideas.

* Speed: A proxy to a local git repository spawns git-annex-shell 
  to communicate with it. It would be more efficient to operate
  directly on the Remote. Especially when transferring content to/from it.
  But: When a cluster has several nodes that are local git repositories,
  and is sending data to all of them, this would need an alternate
  interface than `storeKey`, which supports streaming, of chunks
  of a ByteString.

* Use `sendfile()` to avoid data copying overhead when
  `receiveBytes` is being fed right into `sendBytes`.
  Library to use:
  <https://hackage.haskell.org/package/hsyscall-0.4/docs/System-Syscall.html>

* Support using a proxy when its url is a P2P address.
  (Eg tor-annex remotes.)

## completed items for June's work on [[design/passthrough_proxy]]:

* UUID discovery via git-annex branch. Add a log file listing UUIDs
  accessible via proxy UUIDs. It also will contain the names
  of the remotes that the proxy is a proxy for, 
  from the perspective of the proxy. (done)

* Add `git-annex updateproxy` command (done)

* Remote instantiation for proxies. (done)

* Implement git-annex-shell proxying to git remotes. (done)

* Proxy should update location tracking information for proxied remotes,
  so it is available to other users who sync with it. (done)

* Implement `git-annex initcluster` and `git-annex updatecluster` commands (done)

* Implement cluster UUID insertation on location log load, and removal
  on location log store. (done)

* Omit cluster UUIDs when constructing drop proofs, since lockcontent will
  always fail on a cluster. (done)

* Don't count cluster UUID as a copy in numcopies checking etc. (done)

* Tab complete proxied remotes and clusters in eg --from option. (done)

* Getting a key from a cluster should proxy from one of the nodes that has
  it. (done)

* Implement upload with fanout to multiple cluster nodes and reporting back
  additional UUIDs over P2P protocol. (done)

* Implement cluster drops, trying to remove from all nodes, and returning
  which UUIDs it was dropped from. (done)

* `git-annex testremote` works against proxied remote and cluster. (done)

* Avoid `git-annex sync --content` etc from operating on cluster nodes by
  default since syncing with a cluster implicitly syncs with its nodes. (done)

* On upload to cluster, send to nodes where its preferred content, and not
  to other nodes. (done)

* Support annex.jobs for clusters. (done)

* Add `git-annex extendcluster` command and extend `git-annex updatecluster` 
  to support clusters with multiple gateways. (done)

* Support proxying for a remote that is proxied by another gateway of
  a cluster. (done)

* Support distributed clusters: Make a proxy for a cluster repeat
  protocol messages on to any remotes that have the same UUID as
  the cluster. Needs extension to P2P protocol to avoid cycles.
  (done)

* Proxied cluster nodes should have slightly higher cost than the cluster
  gateway. (done)

* Basic support for proxying special remotes. (But not exporttree=yes ones
  yet.) (done)

* Tab complete remotes in all relevant commands (done)

* Display cluster and proxy information in git-annex info (done)
