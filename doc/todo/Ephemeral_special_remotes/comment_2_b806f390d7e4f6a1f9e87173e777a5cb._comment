There are also some common setup stage tasks that pose problems but could
all be fixed in one place:

* Encryption setup generates encryption keys. Which is both slow and also
  generating an then throwing away an encryption key is the wrong thing to
  do. I think this could be dealt with by copying the encryption setup of the
  remote that is generating the emphemeral remote into it.
* remote.name.annex-uuid is set in git config by gitConfigSpecialRemote.
  Either that could be disabled for ephemerals, or the uuid and name could
  also be inherited, which would make that a no-op.
