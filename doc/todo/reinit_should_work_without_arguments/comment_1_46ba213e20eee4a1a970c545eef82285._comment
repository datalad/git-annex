I don't know that reinit is the best place to put this.
It's a different use case, and a different operation than the current
reinit; making a single command do two opposite things is often a bad idea.

One way to accomplish what you want is to just delete the old
annex.uuid from git config, and then `git annex init` will
allocate a new uuid.
