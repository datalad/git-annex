This is all about usability. `reinit` is where I looked for this feature, and I didn't find it, so I figured it could be expanded to cover that use case.

If `init` can do this, why not have a `overwrite` option or something that will actually remove the uuid key from the git config first?

I don't think we should assume users know that they can edit `.git/config` safely. I certainly didn't think of doing that and sometimes shot myself in the foot playing in there... ;)
