This can happen at other times than repository auto-init too.

Generally plumbing commands just turn off all such messages very early,
but in this case, the command has one mode where it's supposed to get data,
which is plumbing-like, and another mode where it sets data, which is
supposed to display normal messages about what it's doing. So it didn't
turn messages off until after parsing the command line, which is too late.

Affected commands: config group groupwanted numcopies schedule wanted required

Fairly sure that's a complete set, at least it's all the commands with
both a get and a set mode.
