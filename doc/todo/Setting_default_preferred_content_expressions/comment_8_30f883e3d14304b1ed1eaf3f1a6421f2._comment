I'm on the fence about whether the kind of security impact I discussed
earlier is really something that should prevent a global setting, or not.

`git-annex config` of `annex.securehashesonly` is another example of
something where my hypothetical "auditing repos" would be vulnerable to a
behavior change that might be security significant. Since that gets copied
from the git-annex config to git config at init time, behavior in a
new clone might be different than behavior in an existing clone.

Does that mean it's ok for there to be more cases where there can be such a
potential security impact? I don't know.
