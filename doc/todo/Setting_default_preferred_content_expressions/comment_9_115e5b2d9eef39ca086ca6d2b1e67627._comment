Note that you can set annex.defaultwanted to "standard", and
annex.defaultgroups to some group, and then changing
`git-annex groupwanted` will affect all repositories that copied that
defaultwanted into their config.

So that's a way to be able to make changes that will affect other people's
clones. But only ones that they have opted into.
