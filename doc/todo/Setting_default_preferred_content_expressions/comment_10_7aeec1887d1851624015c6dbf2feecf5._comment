If annex.defaultwanted were able to be changed for all repositories with
`git-annex config`, then here's a really ugly security problem:

* First, I make sure to get a copy of every annexed file.
* Then I run `git-annex config annex.defaultwanted nothing`
* Then I wait for git-annex to drop every file from your repository.
* Finally, I demand $ to get your files back.

Now, the same can be done by convincing people to add their repository to
some group and set preferred content to "standard", and later
changing the groupwanted. But that only works on people you were able to
social engineer to doing that, not everyone who cloned a repository
with the default settings.

And beyond the ransom problem, there's the problem that once this is set,
any change to it is going to affect most every other user of the
repository. With groupwanted there's a communicated intent in the name of
the group, and there can be different groups with different versions of the
preferred content expression. This lacks that, it encourages flag day
events.
