I am trying to work around this, but can't really find a solution. Any of the following for one-off overriding of the preferred content would help, but apparently something like this doesn't exist, right? One has to go through `git annex wanted . present`?

- `git -c annex.wanted=present annex assist`
- `GIT_ANNEX_WANTED=present git annex assist`
- `git annex assist|sync --wanted=present`

[[preferred_content]] and [[git-annex-common-options]] don't list anything obvious in that direction.

An environment variable would be particularly great as that's easy to deploy globally.
