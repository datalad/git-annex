I agree generally, anything that is not already
explicitly machine parseable should support --json
(and --json-error-options will be available for free once that's added)

I'd exclude things like `git-annex find` which have
--format that can be used similarly; and a separate json
output would not be very useful for find anyway probably?

I've added a list of commands that currently don't support --json above.

Did unannex already, as it was trivial.
