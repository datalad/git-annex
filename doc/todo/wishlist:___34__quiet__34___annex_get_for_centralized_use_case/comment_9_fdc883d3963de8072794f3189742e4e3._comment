I have now implemented a way to mark a remote as readonly. This prevents git-annex from pushing anything to the remote, or modifying it in other ways.

It seems that in your use case, you might want to avoid git-annex sync pushing the git-annex branch, but still push a branch like master. So far, it's up to you to decide which branches to manually push; readonly disables all pushing.
