That would be great. I'm not very fond of Android because it's only a crippled Linux, but Termux has made my life with Android much better, almost like in the old days on my Nokia N900, R.I.P. :'( I often sync files between the mobile and laptop, and being able to do that in Termux from the command line would be totally awesome.
