A very nice benefit of this feature is that we can now `git annex find` files depending on when their metadata was changed:

```sh
# annexed files which have recently had their metadata changed
git annex find --metadata \"lastchanged>=$(date -d'2 days ago' +%Y-%m-%d@%H-%M-%S)\"

# annexed files which have their tag changed in a specific week
git annex find --metadata \"tag-lastchanged>=2022-12-18\"  --and --metadata \"tag-lastchanged<=2022-12-25\"
```
