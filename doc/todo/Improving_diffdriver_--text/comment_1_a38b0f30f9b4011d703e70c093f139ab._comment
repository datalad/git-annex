If your annexed files have a common extension you can match them in
.gitattributes that way.

I've added support for passing options for diff. Eg:
	
	git annex diffdriver --text -- --color --text --

As for passing --color automatically, I don't know if every diff(1) supports
--color, and this would be more complexity.

I doubt that most users would appreciate diff --text by default for large
binary files. That is really getting into territory that an external 
diff driver program can handle much better. Eg, if you're diffing jpegs and
also zip files, you can write a diff driver program that lists the contents of
zip files and passes that to diff, and that uses imagemagick
`compare -compose` or <https://github.com/x1ddos/imgdiff> 
to show a visual diff between two jpegs.

The point off the --text option is that sometimes you know you have plain
text and so writing such a program is not necessary.
