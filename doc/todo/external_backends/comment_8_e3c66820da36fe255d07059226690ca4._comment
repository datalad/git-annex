It seems reasonable to assume the user trusts the backend program as much
as they do the git-annex program, when it comes to whether a hash is
cryptographically secure. They're both programs the user has decided to
use, which could do far more mischief than pretending that md5 is secure.

The suggestion that this could be used for
[[todo/option_to_add_user-specified_string_to_key]] raises its own security
concerns. (Although git's sha1 collision hardening probably will survive
until git sha256, so git-annex's attempts to prevent sha1 collisions via
user-supplied data in the content of keys are probably unnecessary.)
