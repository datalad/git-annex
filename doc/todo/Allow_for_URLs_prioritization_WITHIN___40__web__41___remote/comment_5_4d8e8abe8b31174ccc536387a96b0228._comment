> Because when getting a file, the main web special remote is tried before this high-cost slowhost one, and will use any url, including slowhost.com urls.

can't I just give the entire `web` remote the highest cost so it is then considered last by default and all the prior \"*web\" remotes with custom costs for fast/slow would be considered in their \"weighted\" fashion?
