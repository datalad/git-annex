100-some lines of code later, I got deprioritizing urls working well.
Eg:

	git-annex initremote --sameas=web slowweb type=web urlinclude='*//slowhost.com/*'
	git config remote.slowweb.annex-cost 300

Now when the regular "web" special remote is asked to get a file,
it will skip any urls that match the urlinclude of other web remotes.
So, it won't use the slowhost.com urls, leaving those for slowweb to later
use if necessary.
