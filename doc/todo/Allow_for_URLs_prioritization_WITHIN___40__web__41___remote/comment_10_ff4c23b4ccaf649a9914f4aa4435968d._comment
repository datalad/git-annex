I think this todo is not fully done yet, because every web special
remote that is split out this way still needs to have its cost
configured in each clone.

So this seems to be pointing to needing a global way to configure
the  default cost of a special remote, similar to `git-annex config`.
Local configs would of course need to override that.

One way that might make sense is to add a cost=N setting to all special
remotes. Then when generating the Remote, it can just look at the value
set there, and use that for Remote.cost. Simple and efficient too.

(That assumes that only special remotes should have their default cost
be configurable, not git repositories. Which seems right, since
the same git repo can have different costs depending on whether it's
accessed locally or remotely, etc.)
