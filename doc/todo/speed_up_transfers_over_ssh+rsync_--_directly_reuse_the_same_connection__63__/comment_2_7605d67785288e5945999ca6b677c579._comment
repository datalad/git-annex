since I am not sure what is the actual overhead here, can't provide any good advice, but may be it is worth looking at least into bundling multiple transfers within the same rsync call?  rsync man page says

       The syntax for requesting multiple files from a remote host is done by specifying
       additional remote-host args in the same style as the  first,  or
       with the hostname omitted.  For instance, all these work:

              rsync -av host:file1 :file2 host:file{3,4} /dest/

so it should be quite possible to batch a hundred or two transfers into the same rsync call I guess.  Probably on other systems limit is different but on linux the cmdline size is quite hefty:

    $> xargs --show-limits
    Your environment variables take up 3441 bytes
    POSIX upper limit on argument length (this system): 2091663
    POSIX smallest allowable upper limit on argument length (all systems): 4096
    Maximum length of command we could actually use: 2088222
    Size of command buffer we are actually using: 131072

not sure if there are inherent limits within ssh etc
