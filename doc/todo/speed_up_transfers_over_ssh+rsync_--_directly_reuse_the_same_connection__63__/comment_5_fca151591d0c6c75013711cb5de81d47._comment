AFAIK, it's not possible to run multiple separate rsync transfers over a single
connection; rsync closes the connection after a transfer is complete (and
the rsync protocol is nowhere documented, and has only one implementation
so there's no way to avoid this behavior). 

So, rsync would need to be told a whole list of files to transfer in one go,
which poses many difficulties, including for git-annex's progress display,
and for needing to queue up a set of files when eg `git annex get` is picking
which ones to get.

I'd want to see a lot more measurements of where bottlenecks are in
the current system, before seriously considering such a thing.
