I don't feel that the benefits of doing this would be worth the added
complexity. v6 repositories are still an experimental feature, and just
because one user is using them does not mean another user necessarily
will want to. One user might be using a v6 repository with `git annex
adjust --unlock`, and if so it will remain compatible with v5 clones.
Only if unlocked files are being committed to a v6 repository is there
a backwards compatability problem.

And, when there's a central git repository, one clone might be using v6
mode but clonding from the central repo would still produce a v5 repo,
so making this change wouldn't help at all with a common case.
