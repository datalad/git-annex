I'm still not seeing much of an application for this, but since I've been
adding --json support to most git-annex commands anyway recently, and got
to initremote, I did go ahead and make --whatelse --json work.

Currently only the field name and description, and a description of the
allowed values are in there. It might be possible to add more information
like type or required or not, but I'd want to work with someone who was
consuming that information to do that.
