Made `git-annex fsck` move the object files to the preferred location for
the repository type. 

You can run it with --fast and it should solve your problem. I'm still not
certain what circumstance led to you having the problem, but unless I hear
back I'll assume it was something like an old version of git-annex. So will
close this bug with this as the fix..
