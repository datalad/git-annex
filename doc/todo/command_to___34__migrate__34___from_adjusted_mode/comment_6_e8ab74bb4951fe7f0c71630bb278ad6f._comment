If fsck locks the content for removal, then moves it to the preferred
location, how is that any different from git-annex first dropping content
and then very quickly retrieving another copy and storing it in the other
location? The only difference is timing, but things like being suspended
and resumed can affect timing.

So, if there is a problem with fsck doing that, there would also be a more
general problem, that could occur in other circumstances, even if only
rarely.

One way to see the general problem happen would be to have two processes
trying to drop the same object. One process finds the object location, then
stalls. Meanwhile, the second process drops the object. Then the first
process resumes, and locks for removal. Per comment #5 this will result in
a dangling lock file in the object directory. I have not managed to get
this to happen yet though.

A fix for the general problem is to make it not create the
object directory when opening the object lock file. So I've made that
change.
