I guess fsck could just lock the entire repo for its duration forbidding any operation?  I would love to be able to migrate the layout also on \"older\" versions of repo/annex without upgrading all the way to 10.  Meanwhile I think I am doomed to write a little helper to do those renames (once, and hopefully never ever again... I might even protect myself by making those top xxx known to me now non-writable at the level of ACL, so the attempt to migrate would lead to an error)
