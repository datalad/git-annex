The biggest reason to use age over PGP seems to be in the simplicity / attack surface. It deliberately does not include options to combat complexity and insecure configurations. It also has a lot less baggage and complexity than PGP: obscure packet-based format, web of trust, subkeys - age does a single thing, and it does it well. I do have a use case for hybrid encryption, but I'd rather not touch GPG ever again if I don't need to. Just the squabble about importing keys without identities makes me want to stay far far away. Age keys handle like SSH keys, so if you have a strategy for those age fits into your workflow very easily.

Age also supports passphrase derived keys now, so the \"shared\" use case is covered.
