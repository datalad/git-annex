git-annex now supports using any program that implements the
Stateless OpenPGP standard for remotes using encryption=shared

Eg, to use Sequoia's sqpop:

	git config annex.shared-sop-command sqop

That fully interoperates with gpg, though it's probably a good idea
to specify an enryption profile that is backwards compatible if interop
is a concern. Eg:

	git config annex.shared-sop-profile rfc4880

For other encryption= schemes, Stateless OpenPGP is not yet supported,
mostly because it's not clear how to manage the encryption keys.
