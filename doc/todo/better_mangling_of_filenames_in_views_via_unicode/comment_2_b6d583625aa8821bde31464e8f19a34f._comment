Hardly the only place ecryptfs's filename length limits have caused
problems to git-annex users. SHA256, for example is generally too long for
it.

It seems to me that the only other thing git-annex could do re mangling
filenames in views is to append a SHA1 of the path to the filename. 
Or perhaps when there is a "foo", use the name "foo.2" for the second foo.
That would also guarantee it's unique, but it seems strictly worse than the
current behavior of using the path for that. It prevents the user
from telling which of two "foo" files is which. (Also it would need a
lookup table to be maintained.)

I think it's ok if a feature can't be used on a filesystem that is too
limited to support it.
