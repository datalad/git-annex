Currently, commands can operate on specific files in the working tree,
or on all known keys, or on a specific key. It would be useful to have
something like `--branch foo` which would operate on the files present in
the specified branch.

For example, this would be useful in bare repos to fsck only the master
branch, and not all versions of all keys.

It might be worth allowing a full refspec, so that eg `refs/remotes/*/master`
or `refs/tags/*` can be operated on. --[[Joey]]
