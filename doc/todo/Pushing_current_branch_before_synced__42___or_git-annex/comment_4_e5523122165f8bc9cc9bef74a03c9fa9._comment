For filtering, the best approach I can see to do that is to look for lines
starting with "remote:", and buffer blocks of those lines. At the end of a
"remote:" block, look for "receive.denyCurrentBranch" in it to decide
whether to filter it out or display it. Pass other lines through.

Note that the remote may choose to display anything at all to stderr, and
it would probably all come in the same block, so that might filter out
messages that the user legitimatly would expect to see. But I suppose in
that case, the other git push that is run for the sync branches, which does
not get filtered, would still let such messages be displayed.

Currently, git does not localize the "remote:" even when the message itself
is localized. This might just be bad/missing localization; some other parts
also don't get localized:

	remote: error: refusing to update checked out branch: refs/heads/master
	remote: error: Standardmäßig wird die Aktualisierung des aktuellen Branches in einem
	...
	 ! [remote rejected] master -> master (branch is currently checked out)
	Fehler: Fehler beim Versenden einiger Referenzen nach '../c'

I suppose if git localizes "remote:" later, it will only prevent the
filtering, so not the end of the world.

Implemented this.
