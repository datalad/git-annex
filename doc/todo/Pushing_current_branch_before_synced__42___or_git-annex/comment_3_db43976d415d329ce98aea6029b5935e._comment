If the remote is brand-new, there will be no remote tracking refs.
git-annex could detect that as a special case, and push the
current branch first then. Since that would only be done one time,
the user would only see any receive.denyCurrentBranch message once.
So it wouldn't be appreciable clutter.

And in the common case where a user has cloned a repo to another drive,
there would already be a tracking remote ref, so the special case wouldn't
happen. And that's the kind of case where a clone of a non-bare repository
is typically done.

This approach does have an edge case where the wrong
thing is done: If the user had origin pointing to one repository, but then
changed the url to a new, empty repository, sync would do the usual push, not
the special case. And so if the new origin url was github or whatever has
this problem, they would still end up pushing the "wrong" branch first.

That is an unlikely edge case, but it's also the kind of edge case that
makes it hard to reason about software, IMHO.
