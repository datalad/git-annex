This works:

	echo * diff=text >>.gitattributes
	git config diff.text.command "git-annex diffdriver -- sh -c 'echo diff a/\$0 b/\$0; echo \$0; diff -u \$1 \$4 || true' --"

Unfortunatly, the textconv approach will not work for locked files, because
git does not apply the textconv to symlinks. It could be made to work for
unlocked files but the above works for all annexed files.

diffing like this is only useful on text files, and most annexed files
are not text files. That's why the diffdriver command focuses on using some
external diff driver that knows how to diff whatever type of binary file is
being stored in git-annex. So this should certianly not be enabled by
default. It makes sense to enable it in .gitattributes when you have
annexed some textual files.

That command is a bit hard to come up with, with the complex shell quoting.
So rather than try to document it, I made an easier way to do the same
thing:

	echo * diff=text >>.gitattributes
	git config diff.text.command "git annex diffdriver --text"
