`git annex info --not --copies 2` displays the global overview (because you
have not specified a directory), and limits it to keys that have the
specified number of copies.

Unused keys are included in the "local annexed keys" count when using
`git-annex info` without a directory.

I agree it would make sense for `git-annex info` to display something
similar to the "repositories containing these files". Although in
the global overview it should show the total annex size of each repository.
