I may have been unclear in my wording but what I really want is `info` to be able to show me numbers on *all* keys of the git-annex branch, including keys not in the current working tree or repo.  
The intent is that I want to preserve past versions and also want to be able to query copies, where they're located etc. of those together with the \"used\" keys. I don't care whether they're referenced in the current revision and want to be able to tell `git-annex info` to not care too.

Ideally, this should skip any unused check; operating only on the git-annex branch's data and none of master's. (That might also yield a much needed performance benefit.)

Total size of annex sounds amazing; I've been wanting that ever since I set up distributed cold storage. I'll give it a spin :)
