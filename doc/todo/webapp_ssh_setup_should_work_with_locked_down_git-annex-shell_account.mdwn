When the webapp is used to set up a ssh repository, it should detect if
there is already a repository, and sshing in to the server forces running
git-annex-shell (perhaps by it being set to the user's login shell). 

In this case it should just use the already set up repository. Note that
it would not be possible to add a new repository on the server using only
git-annex-shell. --[[Joey]]
