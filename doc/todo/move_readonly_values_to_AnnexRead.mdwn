AnnexRead has recently been split out of AnnexState,
and reading values from it is faster (no MVar). So,
anything that never needs to be modified while git-annex is running can be
moved to AnnexRead for a performance win and also to make clean how it's
used. --[[Joey]]

Many things have been moved, but there are certainly others that can be.
