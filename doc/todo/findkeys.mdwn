`git-annex findkeys` would be similar to `git-annex find`, but would find
all keys in the repository, or all known keys.

[[git-annex-find]] has a long comment section with users wanting some way
to do this, but I am strongly of the opinion that `git-annex find` should
list files, not keys, like `find(1)` does. See my comments there.

findkeys could support --format like find, but without `${file}`, and
--print0 and the json options. --batch does not seem very likely to be
useful? The other options wouldn't apply to it, except for matching options
like --in that can operate on keys.

Seems that some users are looking for a way to list all keys known to
git-annex, while other users are looking for a way to list only keys
present in the local repo. If it defaults to listing all known keys,
--in=here can be used to get the other behavior. OTOH, `git-annex find`
defaults to listing only files that are present, so it would be
a little inconsistent for findkeys to default to listing all keys.
I think I prefer the inconsistency over needing a different option than
--in=here though. --[[Joey]]
