Strictly speaking it's possible to do better than `git-annex copy --from --to` currently does.

When git-annex is used as a proxy to a P2P remote, it streams the P2P
protocol from client to remote, and so needs no temp files.

So in a way, the P2P protocol is the real solution to this? Except special
remote don't use the P2P protocol.
