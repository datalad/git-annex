`git-annex copy --from foo --to bar` is implemented now (and move too).

But it does need to download a copy of each file in turn, before uploading
it. Then the local copy can be deleted. Without streaming, that's the best
that can be done. And I think it's probably good enough for most uses.

So this todo is only about streaming now.
