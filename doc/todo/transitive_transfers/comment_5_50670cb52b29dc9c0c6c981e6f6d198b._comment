@JasonWoof re your use case, you don't need transitive transfers.
You can simply go to `old_external` and run:

	git annex sync main_external
	git annex get --branch main_external/master

(Assuming that the `old_external` has a `main_external` remote.)

This --branch option was added in a recent git-annex release.
