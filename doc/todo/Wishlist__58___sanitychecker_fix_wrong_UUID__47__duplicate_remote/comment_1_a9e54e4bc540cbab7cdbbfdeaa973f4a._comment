This does not make sense to me. If the remote is a git repo,
it will be initialized by git-annex only once, so there will only be one
UUID. The second "client" that uses that remote will see the earlier UUID.

Unless there were some kind of a race in initializing the same repo
concurrently, but that seems unlikely and if so this is lacking in any
details about it.

I'm going to close this since it does not make sense, but do followup if
you remember what this was supposed to be about.
