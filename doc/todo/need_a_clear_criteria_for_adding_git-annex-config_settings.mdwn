There are often requests to add various git-annex gitconfig settings 
to git-annex-config. Probably, if every such request were implemented
indesciminately, almost all settings would end up added to it. But adding
settings to git-annex-config can be an imposition on users who don't want
to have to override unusual settings. 

git's own gitconfigs cannot be set by git-annex-config, and git users do
not seem to be clamoring for ways to set gitconfigs across all clones of a
repo. Instead, git users probably use a variety of ways to manage the same
thing, all of which also work for git-annex configs too.

So, git-annex-config, though it started out for good reasons, risks
becoming a slippery slope toward an inconsistent mess. To avoid that,
a clear criteria is needed for when it's appropriate to add a new setting
to it.

----

It's worth considering gitattributes, since they also set somewhat
repo-global configs. (Though less global since they can change in branch.)
git-annex uses gitattributes some too, though less so.

One good thing about gitattributes is that it applies the attribute to a
set of files, and so it only makes sense for things that are related
to individual files. So there is a gitattribute that controls how 3-way
merging of a file happens, but not a gitattribute that controls whether
git commits are gpg signed.

git-annex-config does not have such a scope limiter currently.

----

The settings that git-annex-config supports are, in the order they were
added:

* annex.autocommit  
  This was suggested because someone had a problem of cloning a repo
  where annex.autocommit was usually set, but forgetting to set it,
  resulting in an unwanted commit. This does not seem like a good
  justification, couldn't someone run `git commit -a` accidentially
  and have the same result?
* annex.synccontent  
  This was made a global because there is a hope for `git-annex sync
  --content` to perhaps eventually because the default, and this lets
  users get ahead of that. But that is not really a good justification
  because if that behavior change did happen, there could be a transition
  period where `git-annex sync` warned that its behavior was going to
  change, which would give users an opportunity to choose the behavior
  they want, and configure it locally.
* annex.securehashesonly  
  This is a global because a user who is relying on cryptographically
  secure hashes for their security should not need to remember to set
  the config in each new clone of the repo. Also, their collaborators
  should not need to remember to set the config to avoid committing
  things that do not use secure hashes, which would result in a mess
  that would be painful to get out of. I do think this needs to be a
  global.
* annex.resolvemerge  
  This is a global because, when git-annex's automatic merge conflict
  resulution is not appropriate for a repository, it needs to be disabled
  globally, since one can happen in any clone and would result in the wrong
  thing being commited by git-annex.
* annex.largefiles  
  This is a global because it was already a (semi-)global in .gitattributes
  files, but the syntax of those files made more complex expressions
  hard to use in them. And so also putting the config here avoids that
  problem and does not make it more global. This seems reasonable.
* annex.addunlocked  
  This would be suitable for a gitattribute, since it applies to an
  individual file. But, like annex.largefiles, the syntax of .gitattributes
  files makes more complex expressions a problem in them. So, it was added
  to git-annex-config instead.
* annex.dotfiles  
  One reason this was made a global is probably that there was a large
  amount of user complaint about git-annex add's handing of dotfiles,
  with no one choice that would avoid it, but it did seem that each repo
  probably had a choice that would satisfy the users of that repo.  
  Besides being sick of navigating that maze of complaints, the only
  other justification for it being a global seems to be that setting
  annex.dotfiles works with annex.largfiles to control which particular
  dotfiles to add to the annex (when users for some reason care),
  and annex.largefiles is a global.
* annex.synconlyannex  
  I don't see a justification for this being global.

At this point, we do seem to be a ways down a slippery slope. I started
pushing back at adding them in 2020, and so no more have been added.

Looking at the settings that were added and why, here are some possible
criteria that could be extracted from that:

1. The config is for behavior that needs to happen in every clone of the
   repository, to avoid situations where varying the config would lead
   to difficult to resolve situations (annex.securehashesonly)  
2. The config is something that would be suitable for .gitattributes,
   but limitations of .gitattributes makes it convenient to have another way
   to set it globally (when not actually targeting specific files).
   (annex.largefiles, annex.addunlocked, annex.dotfiles)

Things like annex.autocommit do not meet criteria #1, because it's
easy to fix up a git commit history to remove an unwanted commit. 
Does annex.resolvemerge meet criteria #1? --[[Joey]]
