@yarikoptic let's discuss such a hypothetical command in another todo if
you turn out to need it.

If you have a way to avoid feeding too much redundant data into git-annex
registerurl, you won't need it. I guess that the 8k redundant urls would
not be enough to be a problem, since it would only slow down reading a bit.

If you had a cron job that was adding the same url 8k times every run, so
accumulating an growing number over time, then such a command would be useful.
