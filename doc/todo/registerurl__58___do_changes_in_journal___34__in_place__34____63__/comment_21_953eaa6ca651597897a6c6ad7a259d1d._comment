I've finished implementing appending.

In order to avoid stacking up a year-long v10-v12 upgrade behind the current 
v8-v10 upgrade, appending will for now only be done when
annex.alwayscompact=false. ([[todo/v11_changes]] has been made to remind
me to revisit this later.)

That config is necessary for optimal speed in your situation anyway.

You should avoid setting annex.alwayscompact=false if there is an older
git-annex also installed on the machine, that could be run in the
repository at the same time as a git-annex process that is doing appends.
Otherwise, you do risk the old process seeing partial/interrupted appends
and getting confused.
