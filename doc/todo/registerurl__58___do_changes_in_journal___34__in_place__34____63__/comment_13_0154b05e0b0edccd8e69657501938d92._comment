The `append` branch has basic appending implemented, but it's not yet
done atomically.

For benchmarking, I'm using this command.

	perl -e 'for (1..'$ITER') { print "WORM--foo http://example.com/$_\n" }' | /usr/bin/time git-annex registerurl --batch

ITER=2000  
Old: 52s  
Appending:  28s  

ITER=4000  
Old: 190s  
Appending:  111s  


So an improvement of 50%. But remains nonlinear even when appending,
because it needs to read the existing log file each time to determine if it
can append, or if it needs to compact it. (Disk cache didn't work as well
as I had hoped.)

What this suggests to me is that it would be good to also add a mode that
blindly appends without compacting. Or, possibly, to blindly append,
but then compact the journalled file before committing it to the git-annex
branch.
