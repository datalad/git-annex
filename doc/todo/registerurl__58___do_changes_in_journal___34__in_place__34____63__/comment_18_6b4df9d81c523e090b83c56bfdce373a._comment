This could be repository version 11, but there is unfortunately not a way to
guarantee that an old git-annex process from before the repository upgrade
is not still running and getting confused. The `v9-v10` upgrade waits an
entire year to ensure no such processes are left, and a similar wait would
be needed here.

Still, you could force upgrade the repositories that you need to be fast right
away, or initialize new repositories at the new repository version. Since
most people are not hit by this kind of performance problem, waiting a
while before it's available everywhere is not a problem.
