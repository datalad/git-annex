Rather than buffering in memory, it could buffer to a temporary journal,
and merge that with the main journal at the end. That would let it append
in place without worrying about locking, and memory use would not matter
either. In the common case, files could just be moved from the temp journal
to the main journal, which would be cheap.

Same as buffering in memory, this would change the normal behavior where
other processes can see the changes made by a --batch process while it's
running. So it would need to be a non-default mode.

I think though, that before implementing any of these things, I should
first benchmark how much overhead there would be in locking the journal
around read operations.
