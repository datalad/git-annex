@yarikoptic ok, please check and, if you can do that, 
I'll implement the buffering of urls for a key.

It looks like appending is not feasible..

Only other approach I can think of would be to have a switch that makes
git-annex buffer branch writes in memory, rather than using the journal,
and commit at the end, or when the buffer got too large.
