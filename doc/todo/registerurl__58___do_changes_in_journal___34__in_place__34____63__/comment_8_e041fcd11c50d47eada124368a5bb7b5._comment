I think that CoW and append could indeed speed it up. An append on a CoW
filesystem should be able to keep the original file without copying it, and
just add a new block for the append to the other file. I did a quick test
on btrfs, starting with a 100 mb file, making a cp --reflink, and
appending to it. All operations were less than 10 ms.

The buffering in memory would be while the process was running, then it
would commit it to the git-annex branch. So if no other process needs to
see that data while the process is running, you'd be ok.
