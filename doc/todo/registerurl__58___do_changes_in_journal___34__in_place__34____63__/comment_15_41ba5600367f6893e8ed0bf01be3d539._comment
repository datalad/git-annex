Added the mode that appends without first reading. Enable with
`-c annex.alwayscompact=false`. 

Now some real speed on the benchmark!

ITER=2000  
Appending, annex.alwayscompact=false:  2.6s

ITER=4000  
Appending, annex.alwayscompact=false:  2.8s

ITER=8000  
Appending, annex.alwayscompact=false:  3.14s

I think annex.alwayscompact=false will be ok for what you're doing
in this case. It's probably not a good idea to set it generally,
although worst case is bloat of the git-annex branch causing slow reads
from it.

An example of when not to use it is, if you have annex.alwayscommit=false
and annex.alwayscompact=false, and you run git-annex get followed by
git-annex drop, the location log will be larger than it needs to be. Which
does not cause any problem except for slow reads from the git-annex branch,
and will be cleared up by the first update of that log when
annex.alwayscompact=true.

Still need to implement the atomic appending.
