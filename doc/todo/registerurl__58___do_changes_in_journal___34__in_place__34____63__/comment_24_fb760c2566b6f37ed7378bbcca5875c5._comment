Thank you Joey -- we will give it a shot soonish! (may be we should somehow add \"conda\" devel builds to datalad/git-annex repo ;) ). Possibly unnecessary question just for myself to feel better ;) :

> When appending to a journal file, first read the last byte. If it's not a newline, then seek back to the previous newline, to discard a previous interrupted append.

isn't it racy between \"first read the last byte.\" and then \"If\"? i.e. if some process dumps/flushes more into that file interim, wouldn't you potentially end up with some garbled line? (or there is a lock)
