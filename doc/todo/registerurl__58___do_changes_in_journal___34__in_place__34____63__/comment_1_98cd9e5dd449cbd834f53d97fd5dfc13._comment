You have not ruled out the flat directory structure being a problem,
if your system has different performance than mine. It would be good if you
could try the simple test I showed there to check if reading/writing a file
to a large directory is indeed a problem.

Anyway, nice observation here; growing such a large log file
one line at a time with rewrites is of course gonna be slow.
That would be a nice optimisation target.

(Also the redundant mkdir/stat/etc on every write are not helping
performance. git-annex never rmdirs the journal, so those should be able to
easily be eliminated by only doing a mkdir when a write fails due to the
journal directory not existing.)
