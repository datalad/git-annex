There's actually an undocumented default startdelay of 5 seconds when using
autostart. I've now documented it.

Maybe 5 seconds is too little. OTOH, 2 minutes may be a bit too much;
if the user is booting up their computer to access a new file in their
annex they'd expect it to start syncing ASAP.

I think my justification for the 5 seconds default was that about how long
it seems to take a typical desktop system to get loaded (after the login
screen) and for the user to open a web browser, on reasonably modern
hardware. Even windows in an emulator doesn't take much longer than that.
