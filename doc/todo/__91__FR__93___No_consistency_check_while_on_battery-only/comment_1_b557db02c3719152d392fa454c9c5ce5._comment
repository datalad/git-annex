I agree this would be nice. However, how to detect if it's on battery?

Debian has a `on_ac_power` command which is rather complicated; 88 lines of
code that deal with APM, PMU (powerpc), and two different kernel interfaces
for ACPI (new sysfs and old /proc/acpi).

Then there's OSX, Windows, Android..

I'm going to move this from bugs to todo.
