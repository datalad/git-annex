Well, there has been one bug noticed in v9 so far, it happens to be fixed
in the upcoming release, and it only affected an edge case involving empty
files.

I'm not waiting to make v9 the default because of a lack of testing.
There were some complaints that v8 became the default too
quickly and caused problems when a mixture of git-annex versions was in
use, and so it made sense to slow down the upgrade speed.

Anyway, you can enable the speedup in v8 repositories:

	git config filter.annex.process "git-annex filter-process"
