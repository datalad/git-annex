FWIW, [in dandisets/000026](https://github.com/dandi/dandisets/issues/229#issuecomment-1192971292) I provide provide some timings on committing files renames. Overall rough: pure git (no git-annex) - 1 sec, v8 - 1500 minutes, v9 - 1 minute.  The question is, since v9 is not default, how well was it tested/used in real life?
