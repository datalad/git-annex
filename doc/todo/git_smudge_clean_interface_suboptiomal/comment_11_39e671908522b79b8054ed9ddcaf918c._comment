What about v10? ;-)  FWIW, [I added a test run for DataLad](https://github.com/datalad/datalad/pull/6881) to operate on v10 by default --  remains green.

> `git-annex upgrade --version=9`

FWIW 10.20220624-g769be12 seems to not have `--version` for `upgrade` and I see nothing

> `git config filter.annex.process \"git-annex filter-process\"`

cool -- seems to work (as commit took only 3m on that slow box).  I will go this route for now.
