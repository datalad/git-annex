I noticed that `git annex diffdriver` doesn't make sure that files it tries to diff are actually present. Would it make sense that `git annex diffdriver ...` runs `git annex get` to ensure files are present? ðŸ¤” A `git diff` could then result in a lot of traffic if the user configured the `diffdriver`. But I'd say that users who took their time to configure would be are aware of this or even expect that to happen - after all they want to see the differences to a past version.

A manual workaround is to handle the `get`ting in a custom supplied diffing program.
