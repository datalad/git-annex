There's a plan for speeding up sync --content (and `assist`) at
<https://git-annex.branchable.com/todo/Incremental_git_annex_sync_--content_--all/>

That method is farly similar, and it wouldn't need the user to specify
an additional matching option to get the speedup.

I do think this could be a useful option to have though. (It would not be
possible to implement it as a matcher, but that's an implementation
detail.)
