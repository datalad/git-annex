There's a plan for [[speeding up sync --content|todo/Incremental_git_annex_sync_--content_--all]] (and `assist`).

That method is farly similar, and it wouldn't need the user to specify
an additional matching option to get the speedup.

I do think this could be a useful option to have though. (It would not be
possible to implement it as a matcher, but that's an implementation
detail.)
