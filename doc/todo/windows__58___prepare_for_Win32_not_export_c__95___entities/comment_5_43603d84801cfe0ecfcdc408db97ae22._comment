Thanks, Joey, for making the pull request in Win32 with the necessary changes to support git-annex's
use case. I will be on the lookout for its next release and then as soon as possible try building
git-annex with LTS 19 via stack. I'll then report my findings here if you have not already done
something to that effect before me.
