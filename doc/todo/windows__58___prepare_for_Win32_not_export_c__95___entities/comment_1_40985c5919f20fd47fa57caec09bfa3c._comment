We could go argue with the Win32 maintainer to put it back in.
I have: <https://github.com/haskell/win32/issues/208>

But it is a simple FFI implementation so I would not mind just including it
in git-annex.

... But also git-annex can depend on a version of Win32 before this
breakage. I've made that change. It's perhaps only a stopgap, if something
else that git-annex uses begins depending on the newer version of Win32
later.

Switching to LockFileEx seems like it might break interoperation with older
git-annex versions?
