I see that things are slowly moving ahead in that github issue. On a somewhat related note
I was able to compile with stack on Windows with lts-19.13 by adding the following extra-deps
to stack.yaml (starting from Win32 onward in the following patch):

Yes, that was the newest Win32 I was able to make things work with as stack wasn't able
to resolve the cross-dependencies involving `Win32`, `directory`, `process` and `time` packages otherwise.
And if I remember correctly there was something called `haskeline` that also had specific
requirements.
