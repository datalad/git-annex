Thanks. I see they seem be rather receptive to your suggestion. (I put in a thumbs up, too) The only issue I see is deciding on
how to name the raw version of createFile. Is there some precedent in Haskell land as to naming conventions? C and Python
would just prepend an underscore or two to the name without necessarily indicating that they would be thereby off limits (\"internal\").
Maybe something like `_raw_CreateFile` with or without the underscore in the beginning?
