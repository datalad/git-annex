It's not very ergonomic to type out so much each for each sync, but I suppose it technically accomplishes the idea.

Still -- wouldn't making '\!x' alias to '-c remote.x.annex-sync=false' have minimal impact and provide a bit more symmetry with the matching-options?

I'm not familiar with Haskell, but could probably fumble my way through this one. Would you accept a patch?
