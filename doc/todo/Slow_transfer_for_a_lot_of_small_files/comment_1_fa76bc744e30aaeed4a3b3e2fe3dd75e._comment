Opening multiple connections to a host can be preferable sometimes and it's unlikely to be an issue at all for the larger remotes like Google, Microsoft or S3.

For example, the OneDrive provider spends a lot of time sitting around waiting for initialisation between uploads. Using, say 5 threads instead of 1 would allow it to continue doing things while it waits.

Multiple connections can also vastly improve upload speeds for users with congested home internet connections.
