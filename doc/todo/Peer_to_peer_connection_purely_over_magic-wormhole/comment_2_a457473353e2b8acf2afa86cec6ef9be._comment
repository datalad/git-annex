Forwarding to port 22 shouldn't require root, e.g. the mentioned fowl tunnel could also be used to tunnel a local port to a remote ssh server on port 22. You just cannot listen on a local privileged port, but that shouldn't be a problem.

There are a bunch of \"tunnelers\" like serveo, e.g. ngrok and zrok, but the disadvantage of that is that it still requires a running ssh server.

My imagined use-case would be something like two phones or laptops behind NAT without tor or a ssh daemon. I think with magic-wormhole's dilation feature it would be possible to make it so that you could run `git annex remotedaemon` or `git annex assistant` on one or both devices (after pairing) and have them communicate without any further setup required.

Since magic-wormhole is already used for pairing it wouldn't even be a new dependency.

Maybe this is already implementable from outside git-annex as a custom git-remote though, I'd have to take a look at what git-remote-tor-annex is really doing...
