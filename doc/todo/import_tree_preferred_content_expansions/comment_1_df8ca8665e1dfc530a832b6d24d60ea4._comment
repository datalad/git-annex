Hmm, consider for example a camera. If the user wants to import all jpeg
files from it, and not export to it jpeg files that have a copy in an
archive, they might use:

	not copies=archive:1 and include=*.jpeg

But on import, if "copies=archive:1" were made to evaluate to true
as suggested here, then this expression would not match, and so 
nothing would be imported.

Seems that the approach needs to be instead to traverse the expression
and prune terms that operate on keys. So convert the example
above to "include=*.jpeg".

How to prune in some other cases:

	not (copies=archive:1 and copies=backup:1) => anything

	not (copies=archive:1 and include=*.jpeg) => not (include=*.jpeg)

	not (copies=archive:1 or include=*.jpeg) => not (include=*.jpeg)
	
	not ((not copies=archive:1) or include=*.jpeg) => not (include=*.jpeg)
