The filename **sanitization** is needed for security reasons. A
bittorrent file could contain `../` and similar evil which should not be
allowed to be written to disk as-is. Or control characters which could
cause an exploit via terminal key remapping. Or filenames starting with
dashes to make an unguarded `rm *` end up expanding to `rm -rf something`.

I'd not be surprised if whatever bittorrent program you used to download
that does some filename sanitization too. Opinions on safe sanitization
will vary, so it's not practical to expect git-annex and multiple
bittorrent programs to behave identically.

----

It would be possible to make `addurl --file` usable with a multi-file
torrent. Something like:

	git annex addurl http://example.com/foo.torrent --file bar.mkv
	That url contains multiple files; pick the one that corresponds to
	local file "bar.mkv", and pass it in the --subfile option
		bar.sub
		bar.mkv
		README.txt
	Eg: git annex addurl 'http://example.com/foo.torrent' --file 'bar.mkv' --subfile 'bar.mkv'

Of course this could be skipped if the torrent only contains one file
with the same size and name as the `--file` file.

I don't know if such an interface would be too annoying to be worth
using in your use case or not?
