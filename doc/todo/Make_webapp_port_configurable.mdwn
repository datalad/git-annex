### Please describe the problem.
This is more of a feature request then a bug. 

It would be nice and more intuitive if the webapp --listen parameter accepted a port specifier too allowing configuration of the port. 

For my workflow, I thought I would contain all of git annexes dependencies inside a docker image since I'm quite comfortable with docker(and emerge on gentoo took a long time and finally failed). With an unconfigurable dynamic port though, it makes running the webapp subcommand in docker not really viable since I don't want to use docker run's port range mapping feature which will lock all those ports.

### What steps will reproduce the problem?
Dockerfile:
ARG DEBIAN_TAG=buster-slim
FROM debian:${DEBIAN_TAG}

RUN set -ex \
  && apt-get update \
  && apt-get install -y \
     git \
     git-annex

docker build -t git-annex:test .
docker run --rm -it git-annex:test git annex webapp --listen 0.0.0.0:8888

### Have you had any luck using git-annex before? (Sometimes we get tired of reading bug reports all day and a lil' positive end note does wonders)
git annex seems awesome with the little bit of testing I've done. It seems like the perfect tool for what I want to accomplish. Thanks!
