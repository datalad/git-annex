The git-annex-remote-rclone solution doesn't seem to work in Windows.

I have the script on my PATH, and I'm doing everything in Git Bash. I can run the script from the shell just fine, but Git Annex itself says it can't execute it.

git-annex: Cannot run git-annex-remote-rclone -- Make sure it's in your PATH and is executable.

Presumably it doesn't know how to talk to bash.exe to get it to run the script.
