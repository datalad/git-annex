Fixed the autoinit case.

I'm going to close this as done, despite the cases mentioned above where
subprocesses might redundantly prompt for the credentials. 

Another reason
to not worry about those is that `git-annex sync` runs `git fetch` and `git
push` (more than once), so there will be several password prompts there.
So when git-annex runs a git-annex subprocess, it follows it's just as ok
for it to do its own password prompts as it is for a git subprocess to do
so. The solution to either is certianly to enable git's credential cache.
So the scope of this todo has to be limited to prompting done by a single
git-annex process.
