I've implemented this, and a get of multiple files will prompt once.

However, there is one case where the password is prompted twice.
In a freshly cloned repo, where you have not run `git-annex init` manually,
`git-annex get foo` will prompt twice.

That is because autoinit causes `git-annex init --autoenable` to be run,
and that infortunately probes for the UUID of the http remote, 
which needs the password. Since the cache is necessarily only for a single
process, that subprocess adds an additional prompt.

There might also be other cases where git-annex starts
subprocesses, that legitimately each need to prompt once for the password.
I expect that, when `git-annex transferrer` is used 
(due to annex.stalldetection being configured), and -J is used,
each transferrer process will end up prompting once for the password.

I don't think it makes sense to convert this from a simple in-process cache
to a cache that is shared amoung all subprocesses. That would reimplement
what `git-credential-cache` already does. And if you need that,
you can just enable it.

But I would like to fix the autoinit case to not prompt twice, and am
leaving this open for now to do that.
