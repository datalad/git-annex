Seems that the git-lfs special remote already implements something like
this. When discovering the LFS endpoint, it checks if a credential is
needed, and that credential is included in the endpoint, so will be used
for all requests, and it only prompts once.

So it's only the git remote when accessing annex/objects over http that
prompts repeatedly for credentials.
