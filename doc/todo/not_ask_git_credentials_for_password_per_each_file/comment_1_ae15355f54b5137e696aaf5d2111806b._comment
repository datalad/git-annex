Is this a git-lfs special remote, or a git remote with an annex/objects
directory? Probably does not matter, but also is unclear.

`git credential` is doing the prompting here, and it supports caching, if
you choose to enable that, by eg `git config credential.helper cache`.

It feels redundant to add another layer of caching to git's existing cache.
On the other hand, I suppose that `git pull` can make multiple http accesses
and reuse the same credential for them, so that's kind of a precedent for
caching during the lifetime of the process.
