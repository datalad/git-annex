Another way to look at this is that preffered content allows expressing
`copies=offline:1`, but there's no way to express a match on the
number of copies that are in repositories that are not in the offline group.

That might be expressed as say, `copies=!offline:1`

Then `not copies=!offline:0` would be useful to only want files that are
available in some repository that is not offline.

This would avoid the question of what to do with onlyingroup when a
repository is in the specified group but also another one.

I really don't like the `copies=!offline:1` syntax though. (I already
disliked copies=group:n` and this takes it in an even worse direction.)

So while this is more generic, I kind of prefer the onlyingroup name..
