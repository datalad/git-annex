Junio has now queued for git 2.45.2, coming early in June:

Revert "fsck: warn about symlink pointing inside a gitdir"

I don't know if it will be backported to the other affected git versions.

Currently, the fsck.symlinkTargetLength check has not been reverted,
so might want to still do something about that.

Also, git-remote-annex is affected by the same git clone check about hooks
getting installed as git-lfs. That check is also part of the reversion set.
git-remote-annex contains a workaround, but it currently only checks for
the specific git versions that added that check, so if any new git point
releases don't revert that check it will need to update its version list.
