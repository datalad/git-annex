Note that there is an active patch set in git.git mailing list reverting
many of the "defense in depth" patches, which seem to have had many other
bugs.

I've suggested they also revert the parts of that patch set that cause
these problems.

Will hold off on git-annex changes until the git situation stabalizes,
and until I have free time to deal with it more.
