BTW, I have to mention that I'm deeply unhappy for git for making this
change, with such a 
[weak justification](https://github.com/git/git/commit/a33fea0886cfa016d313d2bd66bdd08615bffbc9),
and so little care for breakage.

 The change came after a security fix which involved symlinks and
 `.git/objects`, but that was a symlink *inside* `.git/objects`, 
which is entirely different than a symlink pointing into the
`.git` directory. 

While it's understandable that someone encountering a
symlink related security hole may want to throw out the baby with the
bathwater, what they have actually done here is to only throw out the
baby. This change will not prevent the class of security hole that
motivated it.
