Fixed git was released. All these versions fix it: v2.45.2 v2.39.5, v2.40.3, v2.41.2, v2.42.3, v2.43.5, and v2.44.2

That does leave the fsck.symlinkTargetLength as potentially still a problem
on Windows, but I think I'll consider this closed and if that does actually
lead to problems on windws we can revisit.
