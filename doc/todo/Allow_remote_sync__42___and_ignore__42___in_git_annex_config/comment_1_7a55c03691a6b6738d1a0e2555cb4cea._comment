We can't put commands in `git-annex config` because cloning
a git repository and using git(-annex) in it should not
expose you to executing arbitrary code.

It's not clear to me what kind of liveness check git-annex could do. A ssh
host is not necessarily pingable.

Configuring ssh to use ConnectTimeout=1 or something like that can help
with long timeouts.
