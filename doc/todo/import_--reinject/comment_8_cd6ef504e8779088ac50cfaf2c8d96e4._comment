@CandyAngel, reinject --known moves the file into the annex. The only time I can
see that it would make a copy is when importing from some other drive
than the drive the repository is on, and it would then delete the source file
after copying.

It does currently always check that enough disk space exists to copy
the file, even though it's probably going to move it. Perhaps that's why
you thought it copied it?
