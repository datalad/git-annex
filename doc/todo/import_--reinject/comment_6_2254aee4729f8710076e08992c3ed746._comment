    There's also the problem of different backends; it seems such a thing would need to hash a file 5 different ways to make sure no hash of it is known.

As it leaves non-matched files alone, the user could specify the backend to minimise this requirement.

Perhaps a new command \"ingest\", with an option for the backend and require --force to try all known backends?

This would be very useful for my file sorting project (when I restart it).
