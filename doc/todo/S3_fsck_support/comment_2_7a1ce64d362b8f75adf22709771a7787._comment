understood: i thought `-f` was `--from`... hence my confusion.

as for `remoteFsck`, i guess what i am saying is exactly that: there *does* seem to be a way to do a remote checksum of the file *without* downloading it. it seems to be a critical advantage over having to download the whole repository to check it... maybe `--fast` could use that technique and `non--fast` would download?

as for the on-wire MD5 stuff, that does seem to be overkill...
