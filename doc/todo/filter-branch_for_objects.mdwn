`git-annex filter-branch` can be used to split a git-annex repository.
However, the approach in [[tips/splitting_a_repository]] then copies all
objects into the new repository and drops unused objects. And dropunused
updates location log in that situation, even when the location log didn't
exist in that repository before. So, that approach leaks information about
objects that were in the original repository into the split repository.

Splitting a git-annex repository is something that, when you need to do it,
you may have good reasons to want to avoid any such leakage of
information.

So perhaps add a feature that copies only the needed objects over to the
split repository? Or update the tip with a better method that avoids this
problem. --[[Joey]]
