One problem with this design is that there may be HTTP headers that are
used for authorization, rather than putting authentication in the url.

I think we may have talked about this at the hackfest, and came down on the
side of simplicity, supporting only an url. Can't quite remember.

It might also be possible to redirect to an url when storing an object.

I think that protocol design should leave these possibilities open to be
implemented later.
