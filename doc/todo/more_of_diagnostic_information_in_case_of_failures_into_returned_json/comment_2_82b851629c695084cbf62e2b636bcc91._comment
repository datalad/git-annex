It seems there is no way to get only errors on
stderr with wget; the choice is between no output, and a mixture of errors
and informational messages on stderr. In --json or --quiet mode, only
errors should be output to stderr.

In general, the --json output does include a "note" with any
available message about why an operation failed. 

It would not be hard to use a HTTP library and propagate the HTTP errors
into the json "note", but it might be hard to get resumption of partial
downloads to work as well with a HTTP library as it works with wget/curl.

What we could do is use curl in preference to wget in json mode; 
curl -s -S avoids all progress etc output and displays the
http errors to stderr.
