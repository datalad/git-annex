Probably wget is just failing to download the url sometimes.
Eg, `git annex addurl http://localhost/dne` fails with the same not useful
output.

wget is run with -q, which is the only way to turn off all its informational
messages, but unfortunately that also turns off display of HTTP error messages.

Using -nv instead of -q would display HTTP errors,
but also 1 extra line of output once the download is complete.
I suppose that's worth the trade-off.
