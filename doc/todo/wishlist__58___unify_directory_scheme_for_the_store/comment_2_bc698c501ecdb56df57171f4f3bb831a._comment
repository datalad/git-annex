Thank you for prompt answer. I didn't know there were tarballs,
and indeed I managed to install them easily (although I had to
manually install glibc version 2.9, only 2.7 was installed).

I found that bare git repos also use lower case hash directory
names... I still would be happy with an optional migration to all
lower case, with a new key-value backend, to avoid this little
complication which happens sometimes (say when converting a repo
from non-bare to bare).
