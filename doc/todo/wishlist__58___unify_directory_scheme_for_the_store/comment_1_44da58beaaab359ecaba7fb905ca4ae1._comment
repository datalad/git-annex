Using the mixed case hash directory names is not desirable because people want to use git-annex on a variety of filesystems and operating systems that treat them in a variety of broken ways. However, migrating to the all lower case hash directory names would require changing every git-annex symlink in every git repository, and I do not want to inflict that on my users.

It seems to me that the best solution to your problem is to install git-annex on your server, which should not be very hard.
