The --json-progress flag should produce progress. I do not understand why it would be a problem to intermix types of 'action' in the output. If file A is uploaded and file B is downloaded and checksummed, that's (at least) three different progress objects to produce. This is exactly the type of information I want to see on the screen instead of wondering if it's stuck. I would also apply this pattern to sync and friends.

Upload A 35%

Upload A 100%

Download B 100%

Checksum B 50%

Checksum B 100%

Go ahead and make per-file json error results available and describe in the documentation.
