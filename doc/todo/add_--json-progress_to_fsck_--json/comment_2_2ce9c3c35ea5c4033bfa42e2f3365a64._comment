It seems problimatic to have json progress for both downloading the file
and for checksumming it. I don't know how that json would look.

In the meantime, though, git-annex has changed to checksum files while they
are being downloaded from most remotes, and when it can do that, fsck
--from avoids the separate checksumming step.

While some special remotes do not support that, it's a very limited list:
only bittorrent on linux, and adb, external, gcrypt, hook, and rsync on
other OSs.

This makes me think that complicating the json output to display two
different kinds of progress is probably not worth the complication.
