Hmm, my assumption is that use of checkpresentkey --batch is in some kind
of loop, or function call, where you'd write a key to it, read a response
back, and now you know whether that key is present.

Does your use case involve something like shell scripting? I suppose if you
have a big list of keys and want to narrow it to only keys that are present
or missing, you could be trying to pipe it through checkpresentkey --batch.
