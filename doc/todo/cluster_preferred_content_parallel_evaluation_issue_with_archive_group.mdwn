I tried a cluster where each node was in the archive group. Sending to the
cluster caused the file the end up on multiple nodes, though the preferred
content should have allowed it to be stored on only one.

This is because a cluster checks preferred content for each node and sends
to all nodes that want it. Which works fine when using balanced preferred
content expressions, but for archive, they all want it until 1 has it.

So to support archive better, after finding a node that wants the content,
when checking the second node it would need to check its preferred content
under the assumption that the first node already contains the content. And
so on. Currently this is not supported when checking preferred content, but
something similar is done when dropping, with a set of repos to assume
don't contain the content any longer.

(Oddly, in my case, it seemed to always end up on 2 nodes out of 4, I don't
know why it didn't also get sent to the other 2.)

(Not considering this a bug, because cluster was designed to be used with
balanced preferred content, which will probably work better in many ways.
Still it would be good to support this, especially for when existing
archive repositories get put in a cluster.)
