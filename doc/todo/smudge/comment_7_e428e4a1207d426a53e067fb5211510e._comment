It seems git 2.5 allows smudge filters to not read all of stdin:

https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/Documentation/RelNotes/2.5.0.txt

\"
 * Filter scripts were run with SIGPIPE disabled on the Git side,
   expecting that they may not read what Git feeds them to filter.
   We however treated a filter that does not read its input fully
   before exiting as an error.  We no longer do and ignore EPIPE
   when writing to feed the filter scripts.

   This changes semantics, but arguably in a good way.  If a filter
   can produce its output without fully consuming its input using
   whatever magic, we now let it do so, instead of diagnosing it
   as a programming error.\"
