Have you checked what the smudge filter sees when the input is a symlink? Because git supports tracking symlinks, so it should also support pushing symlinks through a smudge filter, right?
Either way: yes, contact the git devs, one can only ask and hope.  And if you can demonstrate the awesomeness of git-annex they might get more 1interested :)
