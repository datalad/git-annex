Dear Joey,

During DistriBits 2024, we discussed a concept that you seemed to like: emulating versioned tree export on a special remote with a non-versioned filesystem. This could be a generic mechanism of git-annex. Maybe a new option for the special remote (say: 'versioning = yes / no / emulated' or 'exporttree = yes / no / emulated')?

The idea is to save target files in the remote at paths reflecting the ones in the repo, but:

* create an extra directory at the end of the path identical to the filename,
* directory name includes the original extension of the file, which may seem a bit odd, but ensures no ambiguities,
* inside the directory, save the file under filename = key (preferably add the original extension).

Example: the content of the git-annex repo and remote filesystem after a few tree exports:

	[git-annex]
	repo-name
	|
	|-- phd
	|   |
	|   |-- thesis.pdf
	|   |-- images
	|       |
	|       |-- figure.png
	|       |-- diagram.png
	|
	|-- guidelines.pdf


	[remote filesystem]
	repo-name
	|
	|-- phd
	|   |
	|   |-- thesis.pdf
	|   |   |
	|   |   |--- SHA256E-...-key1.pdf
	|   |   |--- SHA256E-...-key2.pdf
	|   |   |--- SHA256E-...-key3.pdf
	|   | 
	|   |-- images
	|       |
	|       |-- figure.png
	|       |   |
	|       |   |-- SHA256E-...-key1.png
	|       |   
	|       |-- diagram.png
	|           |
	|           |-- SHA256E-...-key1.png
	|           |-- SHA256E-...-key2.png

----------------------

Advantages:

* easy to implement,
* you get (kind of) versioning on any POSIX-like filesystem,
* older versions of files are never overwritten (history tracking),
* it's sufficient to push only the changed files,
* users can use the remote filesystem directly, as it represents something meaningful.

Disadvantages:

* not perfect,
* users need to accept the inconvenience caused by file naming on the bottom level,
* it may be hard to find the right file version in the remote, especially if there are lots of them;
	- modification times will certainly help here,
	- can we concatenate some extra information to the file names that could help in identification?


Feel free to contact me, I'd be happy to discuss and help make this happen.
