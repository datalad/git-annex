git-annex does not keep track of which urls belong to which remote.
Urls are, after all, Universal; it shoudn't matter which remote
set an url.

So, if `SETURLPRESENT` was used, and if git-annex thinks that the web
special remote is recorded as having the content, it will try to download
from that url, as well as any other urls that might be set.

But, `SETURLPRESENT` does not make it think that the web special remote
has the content. So, if the special remote that git-annex does think has to
content is not enabled, `git annex get` won't try the web special remote.

So, what you can do is run `git annex setpresentkey $key 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001`
to make it think  the web special remote has the url after `SETURLPRESENT`.
Then it'll be the same as if `addurl` had been used; it will download from
the web.

(There's also a way to enable a external special remote in readonly mode.
In this mode, the special remote program does not have to be in PATH, and
when git-annex wants to get content from the remote it will download
content from any urls.)

(The difference with `SETURIPRESENT` is that it's assumed the URI cannot
be downloaded via HTTP/FTP. So, while `git annex whereis` displays
URIs, git-annex won't try to download them itself.)
