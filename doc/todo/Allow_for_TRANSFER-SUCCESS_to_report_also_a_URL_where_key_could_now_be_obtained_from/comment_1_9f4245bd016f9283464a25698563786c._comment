Well no, the filename passed to "TRANSFER STORE" is wherever the content
of the file is, in most circumstances it will not be a file in the working
tree.

(And even if the filename is a worktree file in some case, the special
remote needs to support storing multiple versions of a file. So trying to
use the name used in the working tree on the special remote seems very
problimatic.)

In any case, the external special remote protocol already has
`SETURLPRESENT` which can be used if a TRANSFER STORE makes a key be
available at an url.
