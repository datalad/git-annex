git-annex keeps track of the AssociatedFile, which (when available) is 
the worktree file corresponding to the Key that's being operated on.

This information is not exposed in the external special remote interface.
I'm worried that, if it were, people would try to do stuff that
just can't work, like
<http://git-annex.branchable.com/todo/dumb__44___unsafe__44___human-readable_backend/>

Worktree files can be renamed or deleted or copied at any time and can have
multiple versions, and any special remote that used this information to try
to create something that resembles the worktree would have massive
problems.

I am having a hard time thinking of any use that an external special remote
could make of the information that would not be a mistake.
