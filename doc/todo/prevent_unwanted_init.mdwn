My $HOME is a git repo, but I don't want to use git-annex in that repo,
only in sub-repos. If I'm in ~/tmp/foo/ and forgot to git init, git annex
init initializes my $HOME repo, and I have to go clean it up which is
annoying. --[[Joey]]

This could be a git configuration setting, or it could be something
checked into the repo. Either might make sense depending on the scope
in which one wants to prevent the accidental init.
