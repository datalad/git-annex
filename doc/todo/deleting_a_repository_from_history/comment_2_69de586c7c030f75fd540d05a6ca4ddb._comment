`git-annex forget --drop-dead` is probably the best answer.

Yes, this also deletes historical data about past locations of files. The
only user-visible effect of that is that `git-annex log` won't show where
files used to be located.

It has to delete history, because history includes all the data that was
merged from the other repository. And it would be too hard to traverse all
history and delete any information that came from that repository in every
commit.
