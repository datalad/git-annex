Note that making `git annex export` need a remote to export to would be
somewhat asymmetric compared to `git annex import` which can operate on any
directory full of files.

Still, if you want to export to a directory full of files, setting up a
directory special remote before exporting is not too big a pain, probably.

I suppose the question is whether this asymetricity and complication of
perhaps needing changes to the remote interface for `export` is a price
worth paying to be able to have export upload to lots of sorts of remotes.
