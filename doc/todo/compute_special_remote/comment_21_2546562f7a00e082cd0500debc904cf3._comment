Thanks for explaining the design points of datalad-remake. Some
different design choices than I have made, but mostly they strike me as
implementing what is easier/possible from outside git-annex. 

Eg, storing the compute inputs under `.datalad` in the branch is fine --
and might even be useful if you want to make a branch that changes
something in there -- but of course in the git-annex implementation it
stores the equvilant thing in the git-annex branch.

I do hope I'm not closing off the design space from such differences
by dropping a compute special remote right into git-annex. But I also
expect that having a standard and easy way for at least simple
computations will lead to a lot of contributions as others use it.

Your fMRI case seems like one that my compute remote could handle well
and easily.
