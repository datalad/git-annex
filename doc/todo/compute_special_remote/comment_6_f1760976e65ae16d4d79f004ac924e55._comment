On trust, it seems to me that if someone chooses to install a
particular special remote, they are choosing to trust whatever kind of
computations it supports.

Eg a special remote could choose to always run a computation inside a
particular container system and then if you trust that container system is
secure, you can choose to install it.

Note that enabling the special remote is not necessary, because a
repository can be set to autoenable a special remote.
