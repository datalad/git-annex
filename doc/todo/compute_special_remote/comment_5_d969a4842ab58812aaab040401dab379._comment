About worktree provisioning, couldn't you record the sha1 of the tree
containing the files needed to generate the object, and then use 
`git worktree` to make a temporary checkout of that tree? You could
`git-annex get` whatever files are necessary within the temp worktree,
which could result in recursive computations to get dependencies.

I would be careful to avoid dependency cycles though..
