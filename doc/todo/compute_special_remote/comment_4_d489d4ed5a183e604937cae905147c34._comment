An interesting benefit of using URL keys for this is the recently added
VURL keys in today's release, which work just like url keys, except a
checksum gets calculated when the content is downloaded from the url.
This allows `git-annex fsck` to verify the checksums, as well as letting
the checksum be verified when transferring the content between repositories.
(See `git-annex addurl --verifiable` documentation.)

And a nice thing about using URL or VURL keys for this is that it allows
for both fully reproducible computations and computations that generate
equivilant but not identical files. The latter corresponds to `git-annex
addurl --relaxed`.

If you use a VURL key and give it a size, then the checksum is calculated
on first download from your compute special remote, and subsequent
downloads are required to have the same checksum. Without a size, it's
relaxed and anything your compute special remote generates is treated as
effectively the same key, so there can be several checksums that git-annex
knows about, attached to the same VURL key.
