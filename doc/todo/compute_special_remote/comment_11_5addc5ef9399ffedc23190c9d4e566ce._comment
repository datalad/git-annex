@m.risse in your example the "data.nc" file gets new content when
retrieved from the special remote and the source file has changed. 

But if you already have data.nc file present in a repository, it
does not get updated immediately when you update the source
"data.grib" file.

So, a drop and re-get of a file changes the version of the file you have
available. For that matter, if the old version has been stored on other
remotes, a get may retrieve either an old or a new version. 
That is not intuitive and it makes me wonder if using a
special remote is really a good fit for what you're wanting to do.

In your "cdo" example, it's not clear to me if the new version of the
software generates an identical file to the old, or if it has a bug fix
that causes it to generate a significantly different output. If the two
outputs are significantly different then treating them as the same
git-annex key seems questionable to me.
