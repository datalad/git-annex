@joey:

> I do hope I'm not closing off the design space from such differences by dropping a compute special remote right into git-annex. But I also expect that having a standard and easy way for at least simple computations will lead to a lot of contributions as others use it.

I think it's excellent to have something like this in git-annex. I didn't have the opportunity to try it out yet, but I am definitely looking forward to seeing how things can work in practice and comparing the implementations.
