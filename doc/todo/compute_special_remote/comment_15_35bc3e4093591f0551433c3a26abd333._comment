That's what I was getting at when I said:

So just using files from HEAD for the computation is not sufficient to
avoid this kind of mismatch. The user will need some workflow to deal with
it.

Eg, they could recompute data.nc whenever data.grib is updated, and so make a
commit that updates both files together. But if they're doing that, why does
the computation need to use files from HEAD? Recomputing data.nc could just as
well pin the new key of data.grib.
