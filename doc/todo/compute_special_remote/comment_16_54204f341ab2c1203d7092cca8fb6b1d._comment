It could be argued that git-annex should recurse into submodules.
Oddly, I don't remember that anyone has ever tried to make that argument.
If they did it was a long time ago. It may be that datalad has relieved
enough of the pressure in that area that it's not bothering many people.

Anyway, I wouldn't want to tie compute special remotes to changing
git-annex in that way, but I also wouldn't want to rule out adding
useful stuff to git-annex just because it breaches the submodule boundary
in a way that's new to git-annex.

Thinking about a command like this:

	git-annex addcomputed foo --to ffmpeg-cut \
	    --input source=submodule/input.mov \
	    --value starttime=15:00 \
	    --value endtime=30:00

That would need to look inside the submodule to find the input key.

When getting the key later, it can't rely on the tree still containing the
same submodules at the same locations. `git mv submodule foo` would break
the computation. 

I think that can be dealt with by having it fall back to checking location
logs of all submodules, to find the submodule that knows about a key.

Deleting a submodule would still break the computation, and that seems
difficult to avoid. Seems acceptable.
