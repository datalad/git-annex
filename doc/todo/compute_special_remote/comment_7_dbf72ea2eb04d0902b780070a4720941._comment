About request one, receive many, it would be possible for a special remote
to run eg `git-annex reinject --guesskeys` to move additional generated
object files into .git/annex/objects/.

(Doesn't datalad do something like that when it download and unpacks a
tarball that contains several annexed files besides the one it was running
the download to get? Or perhaps it only stores the tarball in the annex and
unpacks it several times?)
