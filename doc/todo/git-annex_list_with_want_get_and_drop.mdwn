`git-annex list` could be extended with information about whether each
repository wants to get or drop a file.

For example, it could use "-" when a repository has a file, but wants to
drop it. And "+" when it does not have a file, but wants to get it.
Although perhaps something more clear can be found. --[[Joey]]
