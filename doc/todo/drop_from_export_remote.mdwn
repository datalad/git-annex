It should be possible for this to work:

	joey@darkstar:~/tmp/bench3/a>git annex move x --from d
	move x (from d...)
	  dropping content from an export is not supported; use `git annex export` to export a tree that lacks the files you want to remove
	failed

git-annex could just alter the tree exported to the remote to remove the file.
It might be a little slow to do that for a lot of files, and it would create
some unattached tree objects that would linger until gc. 

A simple optimisation would be to remove the file (with removeExport) but not update the
export tree for one file. Keep a log of removed files, and at the end of the command,
or some future point where the export tree is used, update the export tree to remove the
files from it.

This seems like a prerequisite for [[remove_legacy_import_directory_interface]] because
`git-annex import --deduplicate` and `--clean-duplicates` need to remove individual files
from the remote.
