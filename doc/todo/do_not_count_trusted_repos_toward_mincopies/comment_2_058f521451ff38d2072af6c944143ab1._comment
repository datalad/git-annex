Perhaps it would be better to leave trusted working as it does now, and
introduce a new intermediate trust level. It could be called eg, "offline".

An offline repo would count toward numcopies when not available, but 
would only count toward mincopies if it happened to be available at the
time.

It might then be that there's no real need for the less safe trusted,
and users could be polled and it deprecated if so.

(This might also be a good opportunity to improve the "semitrust" name,
which would not make much sense if the list was untrust, semitrust,
offline, trust. "normal" perhaps. Would need to still accept the old name
for back-compat of course.)
