Reviewing this, I think what we've shown is that there's no good way to
shorten it, that does not have other tradeoffs!

And what's the real problem with the man page being a bit longer?
Most users are probably not reading through all that, but are searching.
And users who do read through it get to see around 5 commands summarized
per page on their 25 line dumb terminal. Those of us with modern hardware
can often see considerably more commands per page.
