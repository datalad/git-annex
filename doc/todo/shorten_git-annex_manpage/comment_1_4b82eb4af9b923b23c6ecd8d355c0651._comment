I don't like the "git-init" approach; git-init used to be in PATH,
but no longer is, so the git man page is really a bit broken now.
And of course, git-annex-undo is not actually a filename.

The second approach doesn't shorten it much and makes it harder
to skip over the boilerplate in the links when reading since it's moved
into the same paragraph as the description and will appear at differing
positions depending on the description length.

I'd rather make the command name be a hyperlink. However,
it's difficult to reconcile this with the limitations of man
pages.

Maybe aim for something like this in the man page display,
although I don't know if it can be accomplished:

	undo [filename|directory] ...                            git-annex-undo(1)
	  Undo last change to a file or directory.
