Transferring the data over XMPP would almost certainly take too much XMPP server bandwidth, but using something like [libjingle](https://developers.google.com/talk/libjingle/) to set up P2P connections should work nicely. That would require libjingle (or equivalent) bindings for Haskell, though. Libjingle negotiates over XMPP to set up the P2P connection and provides a TCP-like layer for reliable, ordered communication. One could use that for both git metadata and the file transfers.
