As of right now, the only way to commit changes to direct repositories is `git annex sync [remote]`.
There is no way to specify what directory to operate on.
When moving around files on a larger scale, the ability to commit specific subsets of changes would be rather nice.

`git annex commit [path]` or `git annex sync [remote] -- [path]` would probably make sense.


Thanks,
