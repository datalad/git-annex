metadata can be attached to sha1 git-annex keys, which can correspond
to the sha1's of git objects.

Might be worth improving this interface. A `--sha1=` would be a minor
improvement.

It would certianly be possible for git-annex metadata to be taught that
if the file is not annexed, and is in git, to look up the sha1 of its
blob object, and attach the metadata to it.

Of course, modifying a file would not carry over the metadata. But the 
same problem exists when modifying annexed files that have metadata attached.

This would also need changes to view generation, I guess that when building
a view it would need to consider regular git-tracked files, look up 
their metadata, and add matching ones to the view tree.
