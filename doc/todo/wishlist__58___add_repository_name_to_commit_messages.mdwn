The commit messages made by git-annex are quite spartan, especially in direct mode where one cannot enter its own commit messages. This means that all that the messages say is "branch created", "git-annex automatic sync", "update", "merging" or little more.

It would be nice if git-annex could add at least the name of the repository/remote to the commit message. This would make the log a lot more clear, especially when dealing with problems or bugs.
