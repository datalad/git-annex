Yes, a single pre-hook that gets run by every command would not be great
for performance. Especially when git is eg sometimes running `git-annex
smudge` repeatedly.

You earlier spoke of "overall hook for git-annex invocation within a
repo". Did you just mean a hook that runs before initialization, and not
a hook that runs before every git-annex command?

I feel more comfortable with adding a pre-init hook than pre-everything
hooks. For one thing, it makes sense for that hook to prevent
initialization if there is a reason to want to avoid that. It makes a lot
less sense for a `pre-smudge` hook to prevent that bit of git-annex
plumbing from working, which can have very different effects depending on
what git is doing, or for a `pre-find` hook to output something to
stdout.
