> There could be a generalized hook config, eg `git config annex.pre-hook my-hook` could make `git-annex init run my-hook git-annex init` and same for other git-annex commands.

I feel that having such a generic gateway hook would be

- not aligned to how `.git/hooks` operate (separate scripts for different operations)
- make it harder to provide CLI options handling given that different command hooks might have different options (via env var or not)
- add increasing performance hit with increasing number of commands potentially calling such a generic hook

If someone wanted such one, they could create a \"symlink\" driven generic hook which would have resolved its action upon `$0` name as some tools etc do.

I really feel that having `annex.pre-{command}-hook` set of configurations would be cleaner.

> It sounds like you would want a failure of such a hook to prevent the git-annex command from running. Is that right?

I think so... and I think that's how git hooks perform? (less git-annex is special the better)
