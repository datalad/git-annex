Checksum verification is now done for all downloads, unless disabled via
annex.verify=false.

When an object is uploaded to a regular git remote, checksum verification
also also done. (For a local directory, git-annex runs a download from the
perspective of the remote, so we get it for free, and when git-annex-shell
recvkey is used, it checksums the data it receives and compares it with the
key.)

For uploads to special remotes, no checksum verification is done yet.
Leaving this todo item open because of that gap in the coverage.
