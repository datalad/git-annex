Doing this during downloads would still be nice.

While the files are easier to fsck, users will need to actually do this. If it happenend automatically, it would increase safety and reduce disk i/o.

Of course, this will not detect degradation during/after writing.

If you don't make it the default, please at least make it optional for us bordering on OCD when it comes to data storage.
