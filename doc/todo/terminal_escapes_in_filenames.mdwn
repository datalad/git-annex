    touch $(echo -e "\e[31mfoo\e[0m")
    git-annex add
    git-annex find

That displays "foo" in red twice. Compare with behavior of git commands that
display that filename, which display it escaped.

git-annex should probably do the same (except in json output which is
already escaped).

git porcelain also accepts the escaped form of files as input, necessary for
round-tripping though. git-annex currently does not. (git plumbing doesn't
either)

While terminals mostly protect against escape sequences doing very bad
things, there are security holes in terminals still being found.

Of course, such files in git repos can also be exploited by other commands
eg `echo *`. 

So this does not seem like a security hole in git-annex, but it would be
useful defense in depth against terminal security holes, and also good to
behave more like git.
