That sounds like this bug:
<http://git-annex.branchable.com/bugs/__34__git-annex__58___direct__58___1_failed__34___on_Windows/>

Windows has some path length issues that come up especially when using
git-annex in a deeply nested directory tree. Try cloning the repository to
somewhere like c:\\ and see if that works around the problem.
