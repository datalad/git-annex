a very minor and probably should not happen in real-life since noone should check out git-annex branch (besides may be to fix up something manually) but I still do not see the point of scanning for unlocked/annexed files if `init` ran in that branch.  ATM ([8.20210428-270-g651fe3f39](https://git.kitenet.net/index.cgi/git-annex.git/commit/?id=8.20210429-g651fe3f39)) I see

```

init  (scanning for annexed files...)

```

so it reports scanning while in git-annex, although goes quickly (has only about 1000 keys there), so may be doesn't even actually do any scanning and it is just a matter of reporting?


Actually -- it made me think: is that `scanning` branch specific? then what would happen if e.g. master has no unlocked files in the tree and some other branch has unlocked files in the tree -- I could checkout/switch between branches without causing `git-annex` to redo its scanning and would require manual `git annex init`?
