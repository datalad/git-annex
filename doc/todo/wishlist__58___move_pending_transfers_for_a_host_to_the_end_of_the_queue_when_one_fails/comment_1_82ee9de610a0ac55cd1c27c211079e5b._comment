There are several difficulties with reordering the queue that way. One is that the failure may be intermittent; another is that the queue is fed by a scanning process, so doesn't always have a well-defined end.

Another way to deal with this problem, which I think I prefer, is to allow multiple actions from the queue to run at once. Then slow or unreachable remotes don't block it from using other remotes.
