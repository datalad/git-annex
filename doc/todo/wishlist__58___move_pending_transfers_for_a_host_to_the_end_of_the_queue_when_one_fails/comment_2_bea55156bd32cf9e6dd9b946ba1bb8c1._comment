I agree your method might be preferable, the end result is the same, and would have avoided the issues I had (and, of course, running multiple transfers at once has other benefits as well).

An alternate way would be to push every transfer NOT from host X to the front of the queue (avoiding most of the \"no defined end\" issue and largely solving the problem), but if multiple actions at once is feasible then that'd still be much nicer.
