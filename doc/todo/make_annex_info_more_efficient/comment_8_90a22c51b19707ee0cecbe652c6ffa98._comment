It's not clear to me what needs to be done here.

I tried cloning the freesurfer repository, and in it with a cold
disk cache, `git annex info` took 0.6 seconds (warm cache, 0.1 seconds).

It seems like you wanted to get the "local annex size" value, perhaps
without the overhead of the "size of annexed files in working tree"
value? In an indirect mode repository, the former value is obtained
the same as `du .git/annex/objects`, and should be similarly fast.
