yeap, saw fast but it is kinda of limited use. doesn't even go through git-annex branch to report amount of storage occupied.  I didn't check but \"working tree\" is probably a current checked out branch, and that is why requires traversal and thus slow.  What is often also desired to know what is the total number/size of annexed files I have locally in any given annex.  So something along of 'du -scm .git/annex/objects' (but via info in git-annex branch instead).  May be that could be included in the --fast portion?

as for disk-bound:  in my case /tmp is in ram, there is no disk activities, git-annex is 100% (1 core) busy, FWIW:
