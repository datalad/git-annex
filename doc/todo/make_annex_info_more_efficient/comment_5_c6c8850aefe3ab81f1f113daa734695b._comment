When run on a local repository, git-annex info does not look at the
git-annex branch. That would be slower than traversing the directories.
(Asking for info about a remote does look at the git-annex branch.)

git ls-tree does not have to look at files on disk, so is not comprable.
The work `git annex info` does is roughly the same as a du of
.git/annex/objects and a readlink of each symlink in the work tree.

If you just want the .git/annex/objects size, perhaps it would make sense
to have a way to get only one stat from git-annex status. Or perhaps 
it would be as good to `du .git/annex/objects`?
