I was about to whine in a separate TODO but then remembered that the issue is not new...
I wondered -- since sizes report depends on what is present or not locally, and that all directly relates to the state of git-annex branch, could may be annex cache collected information associated with a given annex / current branch treeishes?  Then subsequent invocations would be fast.

In my case I would want to list information on multiple annexes e.g. in current directory.  If each one takes 3-4 seconds, for 30 of them -- minutes.  With caching, at least subsequent runs should be much faster (in case of no changes, which would be frequent case I think)
