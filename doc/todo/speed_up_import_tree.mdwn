Users sometimes expect `git-annex import --from remote` to be faster than
it is, when importing hundreds of thousands of files, particularly
from a directory special remote.

I think generally, they're expecting something that is not achievable.
It is always going to be slower than using git in a repository with that
many files, because git operates at a lower level of abstraction (the
filesystem), so has more optimisations available to it. (Also git has its
own scalability limits with many files.)

Still, it would be good to find some ways to speed it up.

Hmm... What if it generated a git tree, where each file in the tree is
a sha1 hash of the ContentIdentifier. The tree can just be recorded locally
somewhere. It's ok if it gets garbage collected; it's only an optimisation.
On the next sync, diff from the old to the new tree. It only needs to
import the changed files!

(That is assuming that ContentIdentifiers don't tend to sha1 collide.
If there was a collision it would fail to import the new file. But it seems
reasonable, because git loses data on sha1 collisions anyway, and ContentIdentifiers
are no more likely to collide than the content of files, and probably less
likely overall..)

Another idea would to be use something faster than sqlite to record the cid
to key mappings. Looking up those mappings is the main thing that makes
import slow when only a few files have changed and a large number have not.
