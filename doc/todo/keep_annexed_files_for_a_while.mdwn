I don't want files that I dropped to immediately disappear from my local or all of my remotes repos on the next sync. Especially in situations where changes to the git-annex repo get automatically and immediately replicated to remote repos, I want a configurable "grace" period before files in .git/annex/objects get really deleted.

This has similarities to the "trash" on a desktop. It might also be nice to

* configure a maximum amount of space of the "trash"
* have a way to see the contents of the trash to easily recover deleted files

Maybe it would make sense to just move dropped files to the desktops trash? "git annex trash" as an alternative to drop?
