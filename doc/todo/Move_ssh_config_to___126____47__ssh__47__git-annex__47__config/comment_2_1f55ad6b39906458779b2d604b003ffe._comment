Also, if you're going to set up something like local pairing, why would you *not* want to commit that config to git along with your other ssh configs? Config files in $HOME are quite frequently edited by helper programs to configure changes, and I personally commit those changes all the time.

Perhaps your real problem is that you have one `.ssh/config` that is shared between multiple hosts, and the git-annex settings are specific to a single host. Have you considered using [vcsh](https://github.com/RichiH/vcsh)?
