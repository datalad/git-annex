I agree that a human-readable commit message is probably the wrong place to put it. I didn't know about `git annex log` but that sounds helpful. I wouldn't need it to be fast -- it would be for rare interactive use.

I'd like to not just be able to see what changed with the metadata but store a description of why as well, which is why I thought of commit messages. Would your design support that?

Thanks for your consideration.
