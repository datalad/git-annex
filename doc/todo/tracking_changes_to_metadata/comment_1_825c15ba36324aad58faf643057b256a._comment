I don't see the benefit to having custom commit messages for metadata
changes. The changes are there in machine-readable format, so why
involve a human?

I agree that it would be useful to have a way to look at the metadata
history, much as `git annex log` looks at the location history.

Indeed, a lot of `git annex log` could be reused; `getAllLog` and
`getKeyLog` are the hard part and would be reusable for metadata logs.
The result might be something like this, when run on a file "foo":

	+ Thu, 22 Jun 2017 17:07:43 EST foo | author=foo
	- Thu, 22 Jun 2017 17:07:43 EST foo | author=bar
	+ Thu, 11 Jun 2017 11:11:11 EST foo | author=bar

Note that git-annex log is necessarily slow when run on a lot of files,
because it has to run a git command per file to get the log. `git-annex log
--all` shows a fast stream of changes from newest first, but displays the
git-annex key that was changed, not a filename. A version of `git annex
log` for metadata would have these same limitations.

Would this help with your use case?
