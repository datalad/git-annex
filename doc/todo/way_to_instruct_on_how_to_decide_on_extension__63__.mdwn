In our case we are storing videos using timestamp in the filename, e.g.

```
2024.03.08.09.31.09.041_2024.03.08.09.34.53.759.mkv
```

where last number is `ms`.  `git-annex` for MD5E decides that extension is `.759.mkv`, so if we rename file (adjust timing), it seems to produce a new key.

I wonder if you have any ideas Joey on how to overcome it (smarter extension deduction? some config to "hardcode" target extension to be .mkv?)?

Just throwing against the wall to see if sticks
