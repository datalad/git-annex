You can avoid the git-annex branch commits by passing -c
annex.alwayscommit=false to git-annex commands. At the end, run `git annex
merge` to commit all the changes in one go.

The git-annex branch changes are temporarily stored in .git/anenx/journal/
files if you wanted to delete them for rollback.
