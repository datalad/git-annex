## Use case:

You have a few annexes that the assistant is watching for you. You're somewhere with poor wifi speed. You also just added a bunch of big files to a few annexes. Now all of a sudden your connection suffers and you want an easy way to pause all transfers until you're on a faster connection without losing the automatic 'add' and such of the assistant (iow: without having to shutdown the daemon).

## Proposal:

A "Pause all transfers" button in the webapp that pauses all transfers from all annexes the assistant is watching.

It should toggle to "Resume all transfers" when pushed so you can also easily start the transfers again when you get somewhere else.

This may or may not make more sense if the webapp showed all watched repos in a single view (instead of the separate pages/views as it is now).
