When you use encryption=pubkey, the symmetric key that is used for
HMAC encryption of filenames is encrypted using your gpg private key.
The contents of files are also encrypted using your gpg private key
(not using the symmetric key; that mode is encryption=hybrid).

So, with encryption=pubkey, all that can be done with that symmetric key is
to HMAC encrypt filenames and try to find results that match the HMACed
filenames used on the remote. So, if you don't care about filenames
leaking, you could publish that symmetric key with no bad effects. Its
security is not important to you based on what you've said.

But again, that symmetric key is encrypted with your gpg private key.
The only way to decrypt it would be to break your gpg key somehow. In which
case you have big problems. But not ones caused by the existence of the
symmetric key.

So, I see no benefit to the suggested mode.
