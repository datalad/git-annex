Paths in preferred content expressions match relative to the top, so
this preferred content expression will match only md files in the top,
and files in the docs subdirectory:

`include=docs/* or include=*.md`

Only preferred content is downloaded, but S3 is still queried for the
entire list of files in the bucket.
