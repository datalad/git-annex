This preferred content expression will match only md files in the top,
and files in the docs subdirectory:

`include=docs/* or (include=*.md and exclude=*/*)`

I got this wrong at first; this version will work! The `"include=*.md"` 
matches files with that extension anywhere in the tree, so the `"exclude=*/*`
is needed to limit to ones not in a subdirectory. 

Only preferred content is downloaded, but S3 is still queried for the
entire list of files in the bucket.
