I also think that the thinking in this comment is worth considering:
<https://github.com/datalad/datalad/issues/5383#issuecomment-770108778>

Those are valid reasons to prefer to be able to set things like this
in gitattributes rather than the global config. Those kinds of
considerations are why the global config always has a local way to override
it. Sometimes that is necessarily .git/config, not .gitattributes though.
