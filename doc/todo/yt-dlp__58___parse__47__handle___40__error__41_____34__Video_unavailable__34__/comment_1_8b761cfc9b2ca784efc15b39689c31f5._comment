To get the behavior you want, use `--no-raw`:

	git-annex addurl --no-raw 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy01CnsQ9ec'
	addurl https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy01CnsQ9ec
	
	  Unable to use youtube-dl or a special remote and --no-raw was specified: no media in url
	failed
	addurl: 1 failed

Bear in mind that yt-dlp supports many websites, not just youtube, and youtube
probably has many domains (eg `youtu.be`). And addurl can legitimately be used
when you want to archive the current content of an url. So in this case
git-annex can't distinguish between a webpage with a withdrawn or private video
and any other url that a user would expect it to download.
