In some situations it can be useful for a reposistory to not store its
state on the git-annex branch. One example is a temporary clone that's
going to be deleted. One way is just to not push the git-annex branch
from the repository to anywhere, but that limits what can be done in the
repository. For example, files might be added, and copied to public
repositories, but then the git-annex branch would need to be pushed to
publish them.

There could be a git config to hide the current repository.

(There could also be per-remote git configs, but it seems likely that,
if location tracking and other data is not stored for a remote, it will be
hard to do much useful with that remote. For example, git-annex get from 
that remote would not work. (Without setting annex-speculate-present.) Also
some remotes depend on state being stored, like chunking data, encryption,
etc. So setting up networks of repos that know about one-another but are
hidden from the wider world would need some kind of public/private
git-annex branch separation. Which would be a very large complication.)

## location tracking effects

The main logs this would affect are for location tracking. 

git-annex will mostly work the same without location tracking information
being recorded for the local repo. Often, git-annex uses inAnnex to
directly check if an annex object is present, rather than looking at
location tracking. For example --in=here uses inAnnex so would still work;

Of course, `git annex whereis`reports on location tracking info, so if a
file were added to such a repo, whereis on it would report no copies. And
I said "of course", but this may not be obvious to all users. 

And there are parts of git-annex that do look at location tracking for
the current repo, even though it's generally slower than inAnnex. Since the
two are generally equivilant now, some general-purpose code that looks at
locations generally has no real need to use inAnnex. One example of this
is --copies.

One thing that would certainly need to be changed is git-annex
fsck, which notices when the location tracking information is wrong/missing and
corrects it. (Note that unsetting the git config followed by a fsck would
update the location logs, which could be useful to stop hiding the repo,
but if other stuff like annex.uuid is also affected, fsck would not do
anything about that stuff.)

git-annex info is a bit of a mess from this perspecitve. Its repo list
would not include the repo (if it was also hidden from uuid.log), but it
would report on the number of locally present objects, while other info
like numcopies stats and combined size of repositories are based on
location tracking, so would not include the current repo.

Looks like git-annex drop --from remote relies on the location log
to see if there's a local copy, so a hidden repo would not be treated as a
copy. This could be changed, but checking inAnnex here would actually slow
it down. It could also be argued that this is a good thing since dropping
from a remote could leave the only copy in a hidden repo. But then move
--from should also prevent that, and I think it might not.

So the question is, would adding this feature complicate git-annex too
much, in needing to pick the right choice of inAnnex or location log
querying, or in the user's mental model of how git-annex works? 

## uuid.log

To really hide a repository, it needs to not be written to uuid.log.

So the config would need to be set before git-annex init.

If a repository is also hidden from uuid.log, it follows that this option
is not given a name specific to location tracking. Eg annex.hidden rather
than annex.omit-location-logs. But that does raise the
question about all the other places a repo's uuid could crop up in the
git-annex branch.

## everything else

* remote.log: A special remote is not usable without this, and this does
  not seem to be a config that affects what is stored about remotes, but only
  the current repo.

* trust.log: If the user sets this config, are things
  like `git-annex trust here` supposed to refuse to work? Seems limiting,
  and a significant source of scope creep. Maybe it would be better to
  let the uuid be written to these, if the user chooses to set a trust.
  After all, having some uuids in these logs, that are not described in
  uuid.log, does not tell anyone else much, except that someone had a
  hidden repository.

* group.log, preferred-content.log, required-content.log: Same as trust.log;
  Names in group.log do hint about how a hidden repo might be used, but if
  the user is concerned about that they can not add their repo to groups
  that expose information.

* export.log: Same as remote.log

* `*.log.rmt`, `*.log.rmet`, `*.log.cid`, `*.log.cnk`: Same as remote.log

* schedule.log: Same as trust.log

* activity.log: A user might be surprised that fscking a hidden repo
  mentions its uuid here. Also it seems unnecessary info to log for a
  hidden repo. Should be special cased if uuid.log is.

* multicast.log: This includes the uuid of the current repo, when using
  git-annex multicast. That could be surprising to a user, so probably
  git-annex multicast would need to refuse to run in hidden repos.

* difference.log: Surprisingly to me, in a clone of a repo that was initialized
  with tunings, git-annex init adds the new repo's uuid to this log file.
  Should be special cased if uuid.log is. Unsure yet if it will be possible
  to avoid writing it, or if tunings and hidden repos need to be
  incompatible features.

That seems to be all. --[[Joey]]
