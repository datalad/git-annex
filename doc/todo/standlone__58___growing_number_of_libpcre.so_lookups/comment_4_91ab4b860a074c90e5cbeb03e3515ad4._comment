Implemented that idea now, so you may want to drop your test
back down to 40 or 50. Or even better, make the test only look at the
number of ENOENT opens of libpcre.. which should be 0 now.

So far it's only implemented for amd64, i386, and arm. Other architectures
might also have such directories that could be symlinked, I have not
investigated.
