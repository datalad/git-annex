I compared current master with Nov 21, and the total number of git
processes run by init increased from 29 to 34.

One is that it now runs `git config --local --list` to handle a change in
git's security model. (For some reason init runs that twice.)

Another such change is it now runs `git config filter.annex.process`.

And then there's a `git update-index` that I had to add to work around
a (still unfixed) segfault in git.

I think that `git-annex init` is more likely than other git-annex commands
to get such added calls to git, since it has to detect and work around
problems. You might be better off looking at a different command. For
example, the number of libpcre opens by `git-annex version` has increased
by only 1 since 2020.

That one is because the dynamic linker has started looking in yet another
hwcap directory, `x86_64-linux-gnu/glibc-hwcaps/x86-64-v2/`.
As well as the other 5 or so it already looked in.
(For `git-annex init`, that adds another 34 or so opens..)
There seems to be no way to prevent
the linker from doing that excess work, even though it's already setting
`LD_HWCAP_MASK`, as was previously observed over
[here](https://git-annex.branchable.com/todo/may_be___40__again__41___to_prelink_or_somehow_avoid_all_the_failing_opens__63__/#comment-51389bc9e65b7eba6a075270bd1e7870))

Anyway, I think you should just raise the bar in your test..
