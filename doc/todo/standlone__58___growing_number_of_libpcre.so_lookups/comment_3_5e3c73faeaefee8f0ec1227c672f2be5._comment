Had an idea: ld-linux.so hardcodes some search paths like 
x86_64-linux-gnu/glibc-hwcaps/x86-64-v2/ and x86_64-linux-gnu/x86_64/.
There is no way to prevent it doing that short of a recompile. And no way
to make it use a custom ld.so.cache either.

But.. If those directories are made symlinks back to x86_64-linux-gnu, then
it will find the library in the first path it looks in, every time!

On my laptop, it searches x86_64-linux-gnu/glibc-hwcaps/x86-64-v2/ first,
but this will vary depending on the hardware capabilities. I made that a
symlink, and that reduces the number of ENOENT by some 300 when running
git-annex init. And reduces the libpcre opens back down to 35.
