> I'm not sure if there are use-cases where this additional information is useful to the remote

It would be useful when the actions transfer content, since the remote
could look at the key sizes and accumulate a reasonable amount of data
for it to handle in one operation.

>> This is more complicated

By that I meant, it's more complicated for the poor author of the external
special remote, who has to learn about the async protocol.

But not using the async protocol will always have the problem I discussed
in comment #5, since the implementation in git-annex is always
to send a command like REMOVE and wait for a response like REMOVE-SUCCESS.
Using the async protocol lets it keep that implementation simple, by
multiplexing the multiple removes into different jobs, which when
demultiplexed look the same as a single remove looks now.
