Thanks for the response, Joey.

Let me start by providing more details the use case where I noticed this slowness.

I was using a slow remote with a lot of chunks. I stopped the upload and wanted to do a cleanup of the uploaded chunks. That's when I noticed that git-annex was requesting a removal of each chunk individually, even ones that never actually got uploaded.

In this particular case, I could \"preload\" the data since I knew which chunks were valid and which ones weren't to make it faster (though I actually just waited it out)

Also, like you mentioned, this MULTIREMOVE is most useful for this specific case so a more generic solution will definitely be much better.
