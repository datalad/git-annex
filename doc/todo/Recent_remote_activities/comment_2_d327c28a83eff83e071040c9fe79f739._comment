git grep for uuid is a good simple solution.

Maybe `git-annex log --all` could be made to show all location log changes
for all keys. Then you could just grep that for the uuid to see what
changes have been happening to what files (if it mapped keys back to
current filenames when possible). Implementation would be `git log`
filtered to location log files, with `--raw` to get the diff, then
parsing the diff.

There is already code that does something very similar in
Annex.RepoSize.diffBranchRepoSizes. And since that is already run by
`git-annex info`, it would be cheap to pull out a last activity date
for each repo at the same time as the repo's size, and have `git-annex
info` display it or use it in the other ways you suggest. 

The only wrinkle is that is an incremental diff since the
last time it was called, so would not include dates for repos that
have not changed since. So the dates would need to be cached
somewhere.
