Re the default messages, let's just say that any choice git-annex makes
about a default commit message will not be to some people's liking.

Re the hook not being run, this is due to it using `git commit-tree`.
As well as being used for commits to the git-annex branch, it's also
used in a few other places, including `git-annex import`, and
generating adjusted branches and view branches, and the assistant
and `git-annex undo`.
