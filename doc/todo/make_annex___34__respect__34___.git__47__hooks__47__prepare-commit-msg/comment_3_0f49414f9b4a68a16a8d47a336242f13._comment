Irrespective of comment #2, I do think that it makes sense for the
assistant and `git-annex undo`, when committing to the HEAD branch,
to run all the usual commit hooks.

Actually, I don't see any reason for those to not run `git commit`.
It seems that the use of `git commit-tree` in those dates back to 
[[!commit 03932212ecb8940e0fe2dd09c04951990bc29422]] which involved
direct mode.

Fixed those to run commits in the usual way (though noninteractive).
