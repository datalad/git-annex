Thank you Joey!!!  Re

> so you might commit with \"added 57 photos\" to the master branch, and then use the same message for the git-annex branch commit. annex.commitmessage seems to already cover that case though?

how to implement it using that config setting for `git annex assistant` mode of operation when we do not have some kind of a wrapper helper and only hooks?
