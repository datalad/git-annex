I think this needs two things:

1. A hook to get the commit message when committing to
   the git-annex branch. Apparently none of the git hooks
   are well suited to be reused for that.
2. Ensure that the assistant always waits to commit the git-annex branch
   until after it's committed changes to the working tree.

Then you could do a variety of things...

You could make the git-annex branch commit hook look for the last
change committed to the master branch, and reuse its commit message.
(If it's sufficiently close to the present that it's probably for
the same change.)

You could use the git commit hook to generate a git commit message but also
store the message or a list of files somewhere for later use in the
git-annex branch commit hook.

You could write a description of your current task to a file somewhere,
and have both hooks use that as their commit message. (Note that this does
not need #2 above actually, only needs the hook.)

---

Does the assistant always wait to commit to the git-annex branch until
after committing changes to the working tree? I'm unsure. A quick test
indiciated it usually does, but I'm not sure why or if that's always the
case. It would take some analysis and making this behavior more explicit to
be able to rely on it.
