Should be possible to use a git-remote-annex annex::$uuid url as
remote.foo.url with remote.foo.annexUrl using annex+http, and so
not need a separate web server to serve the git repository when using
`git-annex p2phttp`.

Doesn't work currently because git-remote-annex urls only support
special remotes.

It would need a new form of git-remote-annex url, eg:
annex::$uuid?annex+http://example.com/git-annex/
