It could be `%gitdir` or any other you like. It could be that any relative path - relative to that folder since it makes no sense relative to current working dir etc 

I really feel odd about changing PATH for this purpose, especially to point to .git/hooks which want intended to be added to PATH. I think it if it was `.git/annex/hooks` , with documentation about such act happening,  it would be a but more kosher, but I still feel better about some more explicit path specification
