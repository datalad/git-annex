Implemented hooks: freezecontent-annex, thawcontent-annex,
secure-erase-annex, commitmessage-annex, http-headers-annex

That leaves only `remote.name.annex-cost-command` and similar git configs
that don't have hooks. And a few like annex.youtube-dl-command that are not
really equivilant to hooks.

I think I will wait on adding hooks for remote git configs, I'd rather talk
with someone who has a use case for that than make up something for
completeness. Am not currently liking the idea of including a remote name
in the hook for those, but perhaps someone would have a use case that
argues otherwise.
