Coolio! So my ACLs use-case should need/entail

- Setup [`annex.pre-init-hook`](https://git-annex.branchable.com/todo/Support___40__globally_configured__41_____34__annex_init__34___hooks/#comment-17018d2e1d9f26df13aa54c6f3969406) globally to point to the script which would check if ACL is used on a specific folder where `git annex init` is ran.  If it is ran, it would then either
  - Under `.git/hooks` either place or remove (if not required) `freezecontent-annex`, `thawcontent-annex` which would take a single path (file or a directory) which would need to be frozen or thawed.

Is that correct/complete picture or am I missing anything I would need to do for my use case?
