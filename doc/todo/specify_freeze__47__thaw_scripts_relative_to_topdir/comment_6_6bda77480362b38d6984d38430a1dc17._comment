After sleeping on it, I concur that PATH changes feel unwise.

Also, it turns out that git-annex already actually caches existing hooks,
so adding new hook scripts to .git/hooks/ even for things that run
frequently is not a performance problem.

So, my plan is to add .git/hooks that are run in preference to some 
`annex.*-command` git configs. Eg, .git/hooks/freezecontent-annex
corresponds to annex.freezecontent-command.

The "-annex" prefix matches the current pre-commit-annex and post-update-annex
hooks. Also considering adding git configs corresponding to the existing
hooks. I doubt that there would be much use case for configuring
annex.pre-commit-command rather than the pre-commit-annex hook, since the
hook is there only to let users who would usually install a pre-commit hook
to install their hook script without getting in the way of the pre-commit
hook that git-annex writes. But, it seems worth having the git config just
for consistency.

There are some things like annex.youtube-dl-command and
annex.http-headers-command that are configuring commands for git-annex to
run, and are not really hooks per se.

And it does not make sense to have hook scripts that a specific to a given
remote corresponding to configs like `remote.name.annex-cost-command`.
Instead it might make sense to have a `.git/hooks/remote-cost-annex` that
is passed the name of the remote, but that bridge can be crossed if we
come to it.
