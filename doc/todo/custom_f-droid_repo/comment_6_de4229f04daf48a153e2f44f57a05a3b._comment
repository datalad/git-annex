If I've understood Efraim correctly, he means that someone (perhaps, Joey) can run a custom F-Droid server with Joey's builds of the app **copied to the repo as is (without rebuilding there)**, so that those using an F-Droid client would get the updates through this standard path (for them) instead of manually looking for updates here.

Like from a custom APT repository run not by Debian (in this case -- F-Droid team), but by an independent developer who is providing package builds not avaialble in Debian by building the packages himself, signing them, and putting them into his own APT repo (indexing them).
