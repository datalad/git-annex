Implemented `remote.<name>.annex-fastcopy` and `annex.fastcopy`
config settings.

These do just run `cp --reflink=auto`. So when a copy was interrupted,
it won't resume where it left off. It would be possible to improve that,
by making git-annex use `copy_file_range` itself, starting at the point it
was interrupted. At least for keys where isStableKey is True, since
git-annex won't be verifying when using this. But for the
NFS use case, if the server is doing a server-side CoW copy, it's atomic
anyway, so no need to handle resuming.

Since I don't currently know of a haskell binding to `copy_file_range` and
since it's a low-level OS-specific thing, I have punted on handling
resuming. This could be revisited, I just don't see the benefit in the
current use case, and wanted to start from something relatively simple.
