annex.addunlocked can already be set to a [[git-annex-matching-expression]]
and this allows configuring it differently for different filenames, etc.
This has been supported since 7.20191230.

You can already configure annex.addunlocked with `git-annex config`.

Adding gitattributes for configs is problimatic because querying
for them is not fast. They have to be queried for every file. Also the
gitattributes format is not well suited to complex expressions since the
value cannot contain spaces.

The only benefit to supporting it in gitattributes would be to configure it
differently in different branches of the repository. 

There was a todo already suggesting this,
[[annex.addunlocked_in_gitattributes]] and I decided to close it.
