<https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-dkg-openpgp-stateless-cli/> or "sop" is
a standard for a command-line interface for OpenPGP. There are several
implementations available in Debian already, like sqop (using Sequoia), gosop,
gpainless-cli, and hop from hopenpgp-tools (haskell).

It's possible to use this in a way that interoperates with gpg. For example:

	joey@darkstar:~>cat pw
	hunter1
	joey@darkstar:~>cat foo
	Tue Jan  9 15:10:32 JEST 2024
	joey@darkstar:~>sqop encrypt --with-password=pw < foo > bar
	joey@darkstar:~>gpg --passphrase-file pw --decrypt bar
	gpg: AES256.CFB encrypted session key
	gpg: encrypted with 1 passphrase
	Tue Jan  9 15:10:32 JEST 2024

That example uses symmetric encryption, which is what git-annex uses
for encryption=shared. So git-annex could use this or gpg to access the
same encrypted special remote.

Update: That's implemented now, when annex.shared-sop-command is configured
it will be used for encryption=shared special remotes. It interoperates
fine with using gpg, as long as the sop command uses a compatible profile
(setting annex.shared-sop-profile = rfc4880 is probably a good idea).

Leaving this todo open because there are other encryption schemes than 
encryption=shared, for which using sop is not yet supported.

For the public key encryption used by the other encryption= schemes,
sop would be harder to use, because it does not define any location
to store private keys. Though it is possible to export gpg private keys
and use them with sop to encrypt/decrypt files, it wouldn't make sense
for git-annex to do that for the user. So there would need to be some way
to map from keyid= value to a file containing the key. Which could be as
simple as files named `.git/annex/sop/$keyid.sec`, which would be installed
by the user using whatever means they prefer.

Since sop also supports hardware-backed secret keys, and using one avoids
the problem of where to store the secret key file, it would be good to
support using those. This could be something like `keyid=@HARDWARE:xxx`
making `@HARDWARE:xxx` be passed to sop.

It seems that git-annex would need to prompt for the secret key's password
itself, since sop doesn't prompt, and feed it in via `--with-key-password`.
It can detect if a password is needed by trying the sop operation without a
password and checking for an exit code of 67.
