Add a matching option that matches on the recorded url of a file.

My use case is eg using, `git-annex find` to list files that were addurled 
from a given host. So I want a way to match on the url with a glob, eg
`--url=*/example.com/*`

Seems likely that there would also be a corresponding preferred content
expression if adding that.

An alternative way could be to populate a metadata field with the url,
if that were done without increasing the size of the git repository.
