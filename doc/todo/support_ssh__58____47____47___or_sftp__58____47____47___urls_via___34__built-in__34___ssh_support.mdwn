ATM git-annex passes sftp:// urls to be handled with curl.
But that one does not (re)use established ssh control sockets and/or credentials

E.g.

[[!format sh """
$> git annex addurl --debug sftp://localhost/tmp/123

So far we haven't managed to make curl behave sanely with sftp urls without us passing explicitly the login name and then a password and then it still failed:

[[!format sh """
$> curl sftp://localhost/tmp/123 -u yoh            
Enter host password for user 'yoh':
curl: (51) SSL peer certificate or SSH remote key was not OK
"""]]

I wondered if it would be feasible for git annex natively support ssh (scp) and/or sftp urls?  All the machinery is there since it deals with copying files over ssh already.
