Rather than using git-annex push/pull/sync with a complex json format,
complications of knowing what remote it's acting on, etc, a program can
simply use git-annex get/copy/drop/import/export to do the same operations,
all of which already support json.

In the case where the git operation needs to prompt for a password, this
would leave the user with a password prompt with no prior indication of what is
being done. I don't think that's acceptable.

Yikes, that almost triggered my ChatGPT detector.
