They don't have --json, which would be a necessary first step.

This was considered in
[this_todo](https://git-annex.branchable.com/todo/--json_for_unannex__and_ideally_any_other_command_/)
when adding --json to many commands, and the thinking for not adding it
was:

> git-annex-sync (while it would be pretty easy to support, it outputs
> different types of messages depending on what remotes it syncs with and
> what needs to be done. Eg, copy to remote, or export to remote, or import
> from remote. Each would be a different format of json message, which
> violates the principle that all git-annex json output should be
> discoverable by simply running the command. And of course, everything it
> does can be done by other commands, which can support json without having
> that problem.)

sync had not been split into pull and push at that point. Being split does
reduce the space of different things, but it's still multiple things, so
still a problem for json output discoverability.

(Also push and pull can drop from a remote or locally, and of course there are
the git operations they do, which would probably have to become silent in
json mode.)
