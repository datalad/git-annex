[[!meta title="mass reinject of any known content from a directory"]]

Right now `git annex import DIR/*` will import all the files in DIR, both those that are already known to git-annex and those that are new. Using the option `--skip-duplicates` one can import only new files that are in DIR but unknown to git-annex.

It would be nice if there were an opposite `--only-duplicates` option that could be used to import only the files that are already known to git, ignoring the new files in DIR.

PS: it would also be nice to have aliases like `--only-new-files` and `--skip-new-files` for `--skip-duplicates` and `--only-duplicates`.
