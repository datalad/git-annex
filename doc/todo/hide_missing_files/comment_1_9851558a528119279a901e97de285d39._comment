I can certainly understand the issue when people are looking to git annex like a syncthing / dropbox / bittorrent sync alternative and expecting to only see files they have. But, at least for me personally, the feature of listing files I don't have, but *can get* is HUGE. I love being able to see what I have at a glance. Being able to rename and shuffle around files that are not present on my system. This to me is one of the biggest advantages of annex over the competition.

This is both in context of personal file bookkeeping (ie photo library / music etc etc) and in projects (many maya files that are not currently being referenced, but at a glance can be seen).

I suppose, a compromise for usability could be to add custom icons to missing files (yeah I know... cross platform!) such as other sync programs do for incomplete-syncing files, or gui's such as tortoiseGit/SVN do for tracked files.
