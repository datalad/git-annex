The webapp only shows drives the user can write to, because
in general, there are a vast number of mounted things in modern
OS's that the user would be very puzzled to see listed as removable
drives. Such as tmpfs and cgroup mount points, and efi boot partitions.
Complicating the webapp with knowledge to filter such things out would be a
constantly losing battle.

I guess it would be ok to add a "not listed here?" link in the webapp
that allowed chosing from a full list or entering the path by hand.
