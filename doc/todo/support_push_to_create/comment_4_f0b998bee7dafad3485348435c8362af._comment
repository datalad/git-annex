The user might manually `git push`, knowing push-to-create is a thing,
but do it after `git-annex init`, and so annex-ignore is already set
and will stay set until they `git-annex push`. Which they may never do.

To deal with this, when annex-ignore-auto is set, Remote.Git could check if
the remote tracking branch exists. If so, unset annex-ignore-auto and
annex-ignore and re-run the uuid probing.
