The annex-ignore config can be manually set by the user to prevent using an
otherwise usable remote. The man page gives the example of a network
connection that is too slow to use normally.

It may be that no users are actually using annex-ignore like this.
Using annex-sync seems more likely. But, it's hard to rule out.

That presents a problem, since this would need to unset annex-ignore once
the repository was created.

Checking before push if the repository exists, and only unsetting
annex-ignore if it did not exist before sync, but does afterwards, would be
one way around this problem. It does mean that, if 2 people are making
a repository at the same location at the same time, the loser may be left
with annex-ignore set due to the other person having created the
repository.

Or, a new config could be added, that is like annex-ignore, but is only
set by git-annex, and not by the user. Keeping annex-ignore's behavior,
but making git-annex set and unset the new config as needed.
