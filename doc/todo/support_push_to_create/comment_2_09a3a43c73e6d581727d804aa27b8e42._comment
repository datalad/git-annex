Problem with a new config (call it annex-ignore-auto) is that users may
have learned to unset annex-ignore when there was a problem that got
corrected, and would need to learn to unset annex-ignore-auto instead.
While `git-annex push` would do it for them, they might not use that.

Is this disruptive change worth it to support push-to-create? Probably.
But it does make the option of checking before push and after push and
unsetting annex-ignore seem more appealing.

The situation where 2 users are doing push to create of the same remote
repo at the same time is very unlikely to happen. And currently what
happens is that both have to unset annex-ignore. A change that makes only
one of them but not the other need to unset it is not making things worse.
