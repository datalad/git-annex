After spending some time in troubleshooting the situation that `git-annex` for some reason claims that `origin` remote does not support git-annex, I have ran into [11 year old discussion](https://git-annex.branchable.com/forum/ssh__95__exchange__95__identification__58___read__58___Connection_reset_by_peer/#comment-1776b4d3b175c77cdb44fc8656e3352c) which boils down to

> It would be a good idea to `git config annex.sshcaching` false in repositories stored on encfs.

As AFAIK encfs is generally working ok (seems to test ok with bleeding edge [ref](https://github.com/datalad/git-annex/issues/216)), and overall if there is something wrong, it better be fixed and not "avoided", I think that git-annex should either inform user about necessity to not do internal caching within the same repository (e.g. to have it configured to be shared somewhere under ~/.cache/` instead or a like) if file system does not support the ssh caching, or even somehow automagically handle the case, but it should not mislead in its reporting stating that remote does not support git-annex whenever it does.

With this minimalistic reproducer where origin on a regular filesystem and a clone is under `encfs`, we receive a misleading error:

```
> git -C d-clone annex wanted origin
  Unable to parse git config from origin
  Remote origin does not have git-annex installed; setting annex-ignore
  This could be a problem with the git-annex installation on the remote. Please make sure that git-annex-shell is available in PATH when you ssh into the remote. Once you have fixed the git-annex installation, run: git annex enableremote origin
git-annex: cannot determine uuid for origin (perhaps you need to run "git annex sync"?)
```

which is simply due to the fact that git-annex does not only unable to parse, it is unable to connect.  But if so, IMHO ideally it should avoid claiming anything about git annex installation there.
