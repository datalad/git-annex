@xloem nice start!

It would be helpful to get this into a set of wiki pages documenting the
workflows in detail. Since this site is a wiki, you can add pages as you like.
Start by clicking the question mark to create [[/workflow]], and see
[[ikiwiki/wikilink]] for how to add sub-pages like [[/workflow/assistant]].
