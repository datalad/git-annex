i actually answered this in [[forum/Full_workflow_guide]] before realizing this post was a duplicate.

i am not sure where that should be put - it's not a \"full workflow guide\", it's actually a \"specific workflow guide\", namely \"i have 3 computers and need to sync files from A to B to C\"... 

i wonder if this should be marked as resolved or if we want to add a specific workflow for this or what?

this reminds me of my broader [[todo/build_a_user_guide]] task... -- [[anarcat]]
