Good start on the workflow page!

I've added some links to it to make it discoverable.

Not sure if the workflow page quite gets to what was originally requested:

> I want to start keeping track of some files I have in a directory
> I want to copy them to a second computer.
> From a third place, I want to get them from the second computer.
> I change the files on one computer, and I want to make sure the changes get synced to the others.
> What are the commands you'd run at each step?

Leaving this todo open for now..
