git 2.45.1 made git fsck warn if the repository contains a symlink to the
git directory.

While this has impacts such as pushing a git-annex repository to gitlab now
failing, this todo is not concerned with that (because it's not something
that can be fixed in git-annex).

What git-annex can do is configure fsck to not display this warning in a
git-annex repository and to allow fetch and receive to work even when
`fetch.fsckObjects` and `receive.fsckObjects` are set.

    git config fsck.symlinkPointsToGitDir ignore
    git config receive.fsck.symlinkPointsToGitDir ignore
    git config fetch.fsck.symlinkPointsToGitDir ignore

It would be easy for git-annex init and upgrade to do this, but depending on
the magnitude of breakage, which has not yet been assessed, git-annex may have 
to immediately make sure that all repositories it's used in get these
configs.

Is it at all common to set `git config fetch.fsckObjects true` or 
`git config receive.fsckObjects` true?
