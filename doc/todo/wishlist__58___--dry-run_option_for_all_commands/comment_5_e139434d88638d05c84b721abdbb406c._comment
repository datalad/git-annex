Hi Joey,

A million thanks for a fantastic tool.

I came across the need today for the aforementioned  --want-get-by/ --want-drop-by REMOTE options. Is this something that has since been developed/worked around, or is it still in the infinite TODO?

In the mean time, some more explicit documentation that --want-get/want-drop only ever applies to . would be good. I'll see if I can make a PR for this since I can write docs (but alas Haskell not so much).

best,
Kevin
