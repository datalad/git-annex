This would add a lot of complexity; it's not like I could switch off
running all external commands, since many external commands are run to
query state to decide what to do. And then there's large chunks of code
that actually do stuff and would have to all be guarded to not run.

I don't see the benefit to justify this work. `git annex add` is entirely
predictable; it's very similar to `git add`. Which itself lacks a dry-run
option. And like `git add`, you can certianly undo the effects of `git
annex add`.

Matching options can make commands like `git annex find` list the same
set of files that are acted on by commands like `git annex drop`
(`git annex find --in here`)
and `git annex get` (`git annex find --not --in here`).
