Recent git-annex started to handle http connections internally (instead of relying on `wget` and `curl`) which is great in general.  But I wondered if it is relatively easy to retain support for authentication via "standard" `~/.netrc` which `wget` supports nicely.  But ATM (e.g. with 6.20180416) it wouldn't work

Example:
[[!format sh """
$> git annex addurl --debug http://onerussian.com/tmp/secret/index.html --file testDemo.mnc

whenever works with e.g. 6.20180316 if corresponding settings are setup in `~/.netrc`

Or may be there is some other alternative support for such cases now?
