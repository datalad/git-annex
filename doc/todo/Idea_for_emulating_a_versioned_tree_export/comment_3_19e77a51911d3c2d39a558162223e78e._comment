Or, even better: If such an export action would cause data loss, the potentially vanishing keys would be known, because they reside in a git-tree that you diff anyway, right? Git annex could then apply its usual logic of 'I shall never execute an action that reduces a file's copies below `$numcopies`' and error out with an explanation. That feels right and consistent with git annex' typical behavior.
