When we were talking about this idea, I thought there was a problem, but
didn't quite manage to find it then. 

I see it now: If `foo` is an annexed file that gets exported
this way to `foo/SHA--x`, and then that annexed file
is deleted and a new annexed file `foo/SHA--x` is added,
it will want to export it to `foo/SHA--x/SHA--y`.

It would either fail because the file exists, or delete it and replace
it with the directory. The former would cause the export to fail, the
latter could case data loss. It's not defined what a special remote will do
in this situation.

It seems that this case would never occur accidentially, but it's still worth
considering it.

Perhaps it should simply skip exporting any files that have names
that look like annex keys.
