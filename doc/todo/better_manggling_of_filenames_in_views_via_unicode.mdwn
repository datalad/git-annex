Currently views mangle filenames to be unique by converting a file 
named "foo/bar.ext" to "bar_%foo.ext". That is kind of ugly and weird.

But also in views, metadata like author="fred/barney" is made into a
directory that looks like "fred/barney" but the / is a different unicode
character that looks like a regular /.

So, why not also use that in the filename mangling? Then a view
could have a "fred/barney" subdirectory containing a "foo/bar.ext" file!

The unicode might pose challenages for users typing the filename, but
probably users will tab complete or use a gui anyway. If that did cause a
problem for some users, there could be a config added to disable the unicode.

How to handle upgrading git-annex when a view branch is checked out,
if this change is made? It seems it would need to handle both the new and
the old names when unmangeling (in dirFromViewedFile). Perhaps something
additional could be recorded when entering a view branch that indicates what
kind of name mangling was used, so it doesn't have to try both.
