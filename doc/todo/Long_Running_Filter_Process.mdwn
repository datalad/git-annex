Hello,

while reading the release notes of git 2.11 I noticed a cool new feature has been merged:

> If the filter command (a string value) is defined via
> `filter.<driver>.process` then Git can process all blobs with a
> single filter invocation for the entire life of a single Git
> command.

see the [git documentation][1].

This has been developed in the context of git-lfs (see [PR 1382] [2]).

If I understand correctly how it works this could speed up v6 repos. Looking at the history/website 
of git-annex there doesn't seem to be yet any work on this so I though it was worth calling the 
attention on the feature.

Thanks a lot for all the work on git-annex, it's a really amazing project! The more I study it the more cool features I discover :)
