Occurs to me that you can do this with existing options, eg to filter
out directories that are 3 or more deep:

	git-annex find --exclude='*/*/*'

It won't display subdirectories that contain filtered out files of course.

It would also be easy enough to write a wrapper around `git-annex find`
that processed its output and generated output like that.

So I'm going to close this.
