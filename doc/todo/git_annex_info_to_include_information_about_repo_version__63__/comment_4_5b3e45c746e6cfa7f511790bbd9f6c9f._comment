> git doesn't provide any command that outputs the repo version AFAIK, so it's not a useful precedent.

well -- exactly that -- `git version` DOES NOT output repos (its index or whatnot) version HERE. It only provides information about git's version
Either there is some git command which outputs repo (index, ...) version is somewhat independent.  But ok -- I don't care much enough, can take version from git config I guess indeed, even though 'annex info' seems to be the most logical location for that information to be provided from as well IMHO ;-)
