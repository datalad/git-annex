I'm surprised by this behavior change! (And I replicated it on linux, no
apologies necessary for also testing Windows support..)

[[!commit 826b225ca81d469640e51628865dbd64a1d37773]] is the buggy commit.
When there is no metadata log, it accidentially skips calling
getfilemetadata.

I've fixed that. I wonder if I should push up the shedule of the next
release because of this reversion? Currently I'm inclined to treat it as
medium urgency for release (1-2 weeks).
