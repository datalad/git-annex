Hi Joey, We just [now (re)discovered for ourselves in DataLad](https://github.com/psychoinformatics-de/knowledge-base/issues/15) that octal modes are not supported by git-annex **at all**.  We wonder if you are planing to add support for them, or should we may be just start [warning users](https://github.com/datalad/datalad/pull/7375) if there is an unsupported configuration of shared setup is encountered.
