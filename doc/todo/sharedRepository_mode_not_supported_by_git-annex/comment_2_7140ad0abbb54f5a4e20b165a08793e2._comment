I don't think it would be that hard to implement, I count 6 places, all in
Annex.Perms that don't handle UmaskShared.

For now I've made all of them display a warning.

(Note that your warning patch to datalad is probably buggy, 
since core.sharedrepository=1 and =2 are supported by git-annex.
(As legacy alternatives to "group" and "everybody".))
