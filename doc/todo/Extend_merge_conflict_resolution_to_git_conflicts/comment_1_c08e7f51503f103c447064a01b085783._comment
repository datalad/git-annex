I think this would violate least surprise. Users expect git-annex
to behave like git, and that means merge conflicts like git handles them,
when the files are text files tracked by git.

Consider that, if the file is a config file, applying git-annex's
resolvemerge to it would make 2 files with different names be in the
repository. So the config file would stop taking effect for whatever it was
supposed to configure. It would be easy for the user to miss that, because
the repository would not be left in a conflicted state.

When you check a file into git rather than git-annex, you are
choosing to have git manage that file normally. If you want the git-annex
behavior, you can check the file into git-annex.
