Yep, I realised I could grep trust.log to see that I'd marked it as dead, but it did take me a bit of time to realise this (I was thinking \"did I enable cloudstor on this machine, maybe it only shows up on machines you enable it on, but I though I did that previously...\").

I think even a count of dead remotes (so you know what you need to look for) would be helpful, if minimal changes are required.
