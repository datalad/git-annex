It should be easy to fix whatever's wrong the the rsync special remote. Just a matter of debugging that.

Adding encryption support on Windows is stuck at a roadblock I don't know the way around. To drive gpg, git-annex uses the `--passphrase-fd` option, and sends the \"passphrase\" (really a big block of binary foo!) over a file descriptor of a pipe that it set up.

Windows, AFAIK, doesn't have file descriptors, or at least there is no equivilant to them that I have access to in the Haskell POSIX compatability layer for Windows. I am reluctant to fall back to using `--passphrase-file` on Windows, since that would be a massive security hole (as would passing the passphrase as a parameter via `--passphrase=`).
