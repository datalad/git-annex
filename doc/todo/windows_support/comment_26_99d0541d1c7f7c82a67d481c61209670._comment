I've been adding stuff to git annex on my linux server and now I'm thinking that I need to uninit and re-init with `annex.tune.objecthashlower=true`. I'll want to use git-annex from windows as well.

Should I use `annex.tune.objecthashlower=true`? Also, what's the advice around the other tuning options `objecthash1` and `branchhash1`?

Thanks!
