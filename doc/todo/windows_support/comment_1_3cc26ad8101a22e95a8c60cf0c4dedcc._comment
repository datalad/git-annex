What about [Cygwin](http://cygwin.com/)? It emulates POSIX fairly well under Windows (including signals, forking, fs (also things like /dev/null, /proc), unix file permissions), has all standard gnu utilities. It also emulates symlinks, but they are unfortunately incompatible with NTFS symlinks introduced in Vista [due to some stupid restrictions on Windows](http://cygwin.com/ml/cygwin/2009-10/msg00756.html).

If git-annex could be modified to not require symlinks to work, the it would be a pretty neat solution (and you get a real shell, not some command.com on drugs (aka cmd.exe))
