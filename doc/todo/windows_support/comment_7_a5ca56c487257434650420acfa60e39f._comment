I was fighting my way forward until I read here that special remote with ssh+rsync and encryption doesn't work. Interestingly I got everything working so far, ssh login is keybased, gpg -k works and the remote setup also correctly cooperated with gpg... but it just didn't sync. Any ideas how complex it is to get this last missing piece moving?
