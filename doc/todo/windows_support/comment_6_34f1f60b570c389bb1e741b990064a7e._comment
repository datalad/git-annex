It seems that NTFS (from Vista forward) has full POSIX support for symlinks. At least, Wikipedia [seems to think so.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NTFS_symbolic_link). What about doing like GitHub and using MinGW for compatibility? Cygwin absolutely blows in terms of installation size and compatability with the rest of Windows.
