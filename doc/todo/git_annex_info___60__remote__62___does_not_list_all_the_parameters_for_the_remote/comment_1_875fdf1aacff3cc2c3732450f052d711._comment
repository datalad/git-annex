This is an external special remote, and the meaning of prefix= and other
parameters used when initializing an external special remote is up to that
special remote. 

For all git-annex knows, that may be some kind of binary
value, or access token that you don't want scrawled on the screen. It makes
sense for `git-annex info` not to display this stuff since it does not know
what it is.

It might make sense to extend the external special remote protocol
with a command to get additional info to display.
