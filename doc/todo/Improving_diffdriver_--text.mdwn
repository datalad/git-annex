Thank you joey for `git annex diffdriver --text`, that is a big step towards easier diffing of annexed files. The following is now a copy-paste solution to 'make git diff work with git annex':

```
echo '* diff=annextextdiff' >> .git/info/attributes && git config diff.annextextdiff.command "git annex diffdriver --text"
```

This however then has `git diff` use git-annex' diffing mechanism for *all* files, including normal git-tracked files. There probably is no gitattributes-way of applying a diff command only to annexed files, right?

## Customizing `diff` options

Apparently, `git annex diffdriver --text` uses the system's `diff` command and doesn't (allow to) give it any specific options. The below points could be worked around by having something like `git annex diffdriver --text --diffopts='--color=auto'` so that the user can customize the `diff` invocation. Alternatively you could introduce an environment variable like `GIT_ANNEX_DIFFDRIVER_DIFF_OPTIONS` or shorter `GIT_ANNEX_DIFF_FLAGS` that could also be used to temporarily diff *that one file* with specific options.

## Coloring the output

How about passing the (sanitized, `false`→`never` and `true`→`auto`) `git config color.diff` (and fallback `color.ui`) setting as the `diff --color=...` option? The experience would then match the users configured expectation.


## Handling all files as text

`diff` detects some files as binary, although it can make sense to text-diff them (e.g. PDFs), just to get an impression of the changes. `diff` (and `git diff` as well, AFAIK without any good workaround without an external driver again) then just displays the unhelpful message that the 'binary files differ' (you don't say...🙄).

How about having `git annex diffdriver --text` always using `diff --text`? That would deviate from the usual `git diff` behaviour, but I argue that:

- a) People *explicitly* configure (a subset of) files in `.gitattributes` to be diffed with `git annex diffdriver --text`.
- b) If they wouldn't care about the diff between files, then they wouldn't configure it.
- c) Tracking binary(-like) files is something git-annex is explicitly designed for, it makes sense that git just skips over those, but git-annex could add value here

Thanks again a ton for git-annex, the Tübix2023-Workshop was well appreciated and lots of fun. 👍
