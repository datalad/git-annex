The activity log was built for something else (git-annex expire) and there
would be several problems with repurposing it for this:

* A fsck activity is logged when the fsck starts, if the fsck is
  interrupted part way through, or is an incremental fsck, or is a fsck
  of only a few specific files, it is still logged.
* The activity log is designed to also support other activities, and only
  the most recent activity is recorded. While currently it only has a fsck
  activity, it's possible that additional activities be added to support
  git-annex expire. That would prevent displaying a fsck after such an
  activity was recorded.

It seems like your use case would need a log to be updated only once a
complete fsck was done. Since fsck supports ad-hoc running on specific
files, incremental fscks, fscking of other branches, etc, it's kind of hard
to tell when that has happened.
