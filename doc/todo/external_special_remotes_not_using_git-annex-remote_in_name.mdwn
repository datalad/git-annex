rclone now supports being run as a git-annex special remote natively
see <https://github.com/rclone/rclone/pull/7654>. "rclone gitannex"
is the command to run. But git-annex needs a git-annex-remote-rclone or similar,
so to use it needs a git-annex-remote-rclone-builtin symlink to rclone,
and when run under that name it behaves as if "rclone gitannex" were run.

rclone won't be shipping that symlink, so users will have to create it
themselves, which complicates using it. So could git-annex instead
support running "rclone gitannex" itself?

But, that seems to present a security problem. Consider an attacker who runs
`git-annex initremote foo type=external autoenable=true externaltype=rm externaltype=/foo`

My conclusion is that git-annex can't provide a generic way to run a different
command for an external special remote. Any such commands need to be
whitelisted in some way. And if they're whitelisted, it seems better to not
require the user to enter additional parameters at all.

So one way would be to make "git-annex initremote foo type=external externaltype=rclone-builtin"
run "rclone gitannex".

Or, git-annex add an internal rclone special remote, that is just
a wrapper around the external special remote, that makes it use
"rclone gitannex". "git-annex initremote foo type=rclone" --[[Joey]]
