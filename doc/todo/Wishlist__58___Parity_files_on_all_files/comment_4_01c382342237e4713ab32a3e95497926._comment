The post-update-annex hook is run whenever the git-annex branch changes,
so any change to the annexed files stored in the repository will be
followed by this hook running.

But then how would that hook figure out which content files have been added,
in order to add parity files for them? Well, someone else had a similar
type of redundancy information they wanted to add, see
[[Log_function_to_enumerate_all_recent_git-annex_changes]] for a thread
about it.
