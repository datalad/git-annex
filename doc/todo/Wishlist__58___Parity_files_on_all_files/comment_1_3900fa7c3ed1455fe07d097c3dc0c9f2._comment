git repositories don't contain parity files for their data. Instead, git
relies on multiple copies of the repository to keep things safe. Not as
efficient as parity files, but a lot easier, and protects against many more
disasters than do parity files. git-annex takes the same approach.
Lots Of Copies Keeps Stuff Safe.

Even if git-annex started generating parity files for its objects,
the git repository would still not have them, so bit flips could still
corrupt your git-annex repository.

Nothing stops you from writing git hooks that maintain parity files
alongside all the files in a git repository. If you do that, you'll get
parity files for the git-annex files too. But I don't see this being needed
in git-annex itself and AFAICS there are plenty of hooks in git and
git-annex to allow doing that.
