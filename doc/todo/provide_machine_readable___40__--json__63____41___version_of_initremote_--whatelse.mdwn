which would make it necessary to establish a possibly fragile parsing by any tool which would like to programmatically obtain/use/expose those options.

It would be great if there was a way to trigger such listing be output in more friendly for machines form? e.g. a json dictionary alike

```json
{
 "rsyncurl": {
   "required": True,
   "description": "url or hostname:/directory for rsync to use"
 },
 "shellescape": {
   "description": "avoid usual shell escaping (not recommended)",
   "choices": ["yes", "no"]
   },
   ...
}
```

Looking at the [protocol](https://git-annex.branchable.com/design/external_special_remote_protocol/) I see no indication of "required" or "choices" to be actually explicitly provided by the remote fields, so I guess just supposed to be included in the text, so may be given current state of things, aforementioned dictionary would be simply ```{"NAME": "DESCRIPTION"}```,  which someone makes this proposed TODO less valuable.
