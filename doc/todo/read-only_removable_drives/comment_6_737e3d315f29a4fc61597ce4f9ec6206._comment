well this specific issue is more about how git-annex cannot get files off readonly medium, whether it is webapp or not.

maybe it would be wiser to split this up in separate bug reports, because I had at least three different situations:

* trying to add an external readonly drive through the webapp: not detected
* trying to add an external readonly drive through the commandline: fails to sync? - to be confirmed
* trying to add a ssh readonly remote through the webapp: fails to sync and considers the remote \"git-only\" (which also fails)

I would need to try the third case through the commandline.

And then there's the upgrade scenario in [[bugs/annex_get_fails_from_read-only_filesystem/]].

Did i miss anything?
