so i tried another experiment today: i tried to allow access to a remote user to my /srv/foo annex. the annex is writable by me, but not by the user, yet i was expecting the user to be able to sync with it. not push, mind you, but at least pull: in a \"git-only\" scenario, that would be perfectly possible. yet the assistant freaks out because it can't run git-annex on the repo because of a write failure on some pack files, and downgrades the repository to a \"git-only\" repo, which is also inaccurate: it can't sync the metadata either...

i would have expected this repository to be marked as \"readonly\" and the user be capable of fetching new changes automatically from the \"central repo\".

maybe that's the essence of the todo here... --[[anarcat]]
