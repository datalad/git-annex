The assistant ignores drives that it cannot write to. This is a very good heuristic to avoid listing every special device in linux, OSX, etc as possible removable drives. I don't think it makes sense for the assistant to try to handle this use case.

Is there some problem using git-annex at the command line with a remote that is read-only? I don't see any problem in my tests.

<pre>
joey@darkstar:~/tmp/r>git annex drop
drop foo ok
(Recording state in git...)
joey@darkstar:~/tmp/r>ls -ld ../readonly
drwxr-xr-x 3 root root 4096 May 16 14:08 ../readonly/
joey@darkstar:~/tmp/r>git annex get --from readonly
get foo (from readonly...) ok
(Recording state in git...)
