While I agree that being unable to fix symlinks can sometimes be a bit annoying your examples have straightforward solutions using existing tools:

1. `g add -f <symlink>` - [`gx fix`] - `gx unannex`. \"Unlocks\" and `rm`'s in one go. Does still leave a copy in annex (as did your `git rm --cached`) so you still have to contend with that.
1. `diff` before moving the file. You have to type the relpath anyway to move the file so might as well just type the relpath into diff instead of mv.

It's unfortunately fairly antithetical to modify any untracked file by `git`. This includes modifying symlink paths. Therefore the existing friction is actually helping new users figure out the proper way of doing things in a git environment IMHO.
