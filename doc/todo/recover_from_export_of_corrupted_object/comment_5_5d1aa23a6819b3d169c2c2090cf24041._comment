#1 is not needed for the case of a versioned S3 bucket, because after
`git-annex fsck --from S3` corrects the problem, `git-annex export --to S3`
will see that the file is not in S3, and re-upload it.

In the general case, #1 is still needed. I think
[[todo/drop_from_export_remote]] would solve this, and so no need to deal
with it here.
