I thought about making `git-annex export` checksum files before uploading,
but I don't see why export needs that any more than a regular copy to a
remote does. In either case, annex.verify will notice the bad content when
getting from the remote, and fscking the remote will also detect it, and
now, recover from it.

It seems unlikely to me that the annex object file got truncated before
it was sent to ds005256 in any case. Seems more likely that the upload
was somehow not of the whole file.
