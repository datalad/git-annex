If [[todo/drop_from_export_remote]] were implemented that would take care
of #1.

Since `git-annex fsck` already tells the user what to do when it finds a
corrupted file on an export remote, and that works for ones not using
versioning, I think #1 can be left to that todo to solve,
and #2 be dealt with here. That will be enough to recover the problem
dataset.
