If [[todo/drop_from_export_remote]] were implemented that would take care
of #1.

The user can export a tree that removes the file themselves. fsck even
suggests doing that when it finds a corrupted file on an exporttree remote,
since it's unable to drop it in that case.

But notice that the fsck run above does not suggest doing that. Granted,
with a S3 bucket with versioning, exporting a tree won't remove the
corrupted version of the file from the remote anyway.

It seems that dealing with #2 here is enough to recover the problem
dataset, and #1 can be left to that other todo.
