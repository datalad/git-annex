erics, that all makes a lot of sense, except I don't know if there's actually a use case for a git-annex that behaves that way. It doesn't seem to solve the original use case.

I'd be inclinded to instead use the new metadata support. A file could have a tag that indicates it's not strongly wanted, and if git-annex get doesn't have enough space it could seek out and drop such files.
