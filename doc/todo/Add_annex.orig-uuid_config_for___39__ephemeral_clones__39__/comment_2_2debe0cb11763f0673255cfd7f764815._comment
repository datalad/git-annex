Is there any reason you don't initialize the clone with the same uuid as
the parent remote? That seems to me like it would make sense, since they
*are* the same git-annex repository.

Can you refresh my memory of where we discussed this --reckless=ephemeral
hack? I can't find it discussed by that name anywhere in git-annex or mail
mail archives. Just want to understand the motivation of doing that,
and why other approaches were not considered.
