Occurs to me that this is very similar to `git worktree`. The difference
is that you can make whatever changes to git branches in this "ephemeral
clone" without affecting the parent repository. But as far as git-annex is
concerned, in both cases there are two git repositories that share their
.git/annex and so are essentially the same git-annex repository.
