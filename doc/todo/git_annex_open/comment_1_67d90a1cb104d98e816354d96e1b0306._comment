Hmm, well, there have been requests for access to files as they're being
get-ed before. This does have the advantage of providing that,
but I don't know if I like trying in xdg-open, which might not always
be the way a user wants to open a file.

git-annex does have progress info available while a file is being
transferred. (If nothing else, it tends to know the key size, and can
see the file size.) However I don't know how it could tell if "enough"
of the file was available to stream it.

I guess what I'd be most comfortable with is putting in plumbing.
Like making `examinekey` be able to report the temporary file
that is used when a key is being downloaded. It might also make sense to
have a bit of plumbing that waits for a file being downloaded to get
to X% complete, or something.
