It's actually possible to use a rsync special remote to fetch objects right
out of `.git/annex/objects/`. For example:

	git-annex initremote foo-rsync type=rsync encryption=none rsyncurl=example.com:/path/to/repo/.git/annex/objects/ --sameas=foo

Since the default hash directory paths are different for rsync than for a
git-annex repository, getting an object will first try the wrong hash path,
which does lead to rsync complaining to stderr. But then it will fall back
to a hash path that works.

Sending an object to the rsync special remote will store it in a hash path
different from the one that git-annex usually uses. So later switching to using
git-annex in that repository will result in some unusual behavior, since
it won't see some files that were put there. `git-annex fsck` will actually
recover from this too, eg:

	fsck newfile (normalizing object location) (checksum...) ok

There are enough problems that I can't really recommend this, 
it just seemed worth pointing out that it can be done.
