Joey implemented the '--force' option in *git annex migrate* at my request to deal with this issue.

* Rename symlinks to lowercase extension
* git annex migrate --force (causes the keys to be recreated using the new, lowercase extension)
* git annex unused (for removing the now unused upper/mixed case files in the store).

It's not the smoothest method, but it works well enough :)
