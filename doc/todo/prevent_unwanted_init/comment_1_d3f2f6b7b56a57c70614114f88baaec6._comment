+1 for this feature.  For our usecase I would vote for \"something checked into the repo\", e.g. a file `.noannex`, optionally containing a message to be displayed whenever `annex init` detects its presence and refuses to proceed forward.  Message could then provide instructions on what repository authors advise to do (e.g. establish submodules with git-annex'ed repositories).
