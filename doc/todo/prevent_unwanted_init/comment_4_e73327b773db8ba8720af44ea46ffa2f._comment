If git had a general-purpose config file checked into the repo, I'd use
that. The closest there is is the .gitattributes file, but that's very
unsuited for this purpose. It is per-file, so a hack like "*" would be
needed to refer to the whole repo. Worse, it doesn't allow setting values
containing spaces, which prevents putting a message to the user in there
in any reasonable format.
