I'm not sure I'd trust an old comment of mine to reflect whether httpalso
supports http authentication. From what I can see, without trying it, it
will use git-credential to prompt for password when receiving a 401
response, the same as all other parts of git-annex that download urls
do nowadays.

Re git-remote-annex, I see your point though. Since it does set up the
remote when cloning, and webdav remote setup calls involves creating and
deleting a test file, the user needs write access currently. (Whether that
test file is worth it doing at all, I'm on the fence about. It seemed like
a good idea way back when.)

I think that, rather than needing readonly=true, enableremote of a webdav
special remote should just assume it exists and not test write access to
it. Then it will work with readonly access. I've implemented that.

And I've made git-remote-annex on git clone do an enableremote, rather than
an initremote. That should make it work with a readonly webdav special
remote.
