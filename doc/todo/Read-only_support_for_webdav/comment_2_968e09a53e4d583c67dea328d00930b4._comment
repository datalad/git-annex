Thank you! I had an opportunity to try it out only recently, and it worked great!

With that, I can use a regular (read/write) WebDAV special remote to store data on a Nextcloud instance; then, when I want to publish (without granting write access), I can `initremote --sameas`, and enable the second remote using a public read-only WebDAV URL (which is not the share link generated by Nextcloud, but can be easily derived from it). The public share can be password-protected. And, indeed, git-remote-annex works seamlessly on top. Very little needs to be done in terms of remote configuration to make it work. This is cool.
