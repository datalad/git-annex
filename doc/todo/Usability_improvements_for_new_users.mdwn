Hi there,

I'm a relatively new to `git-annex` and quite impressed so far.

I've found the command to be somewhat less self-documenting than I'd like it to be for a new user.
Particularly, since it's a `git` subcommand, I'd wish for annex to 'mirror' as many subcommands as possible
with `annex`-enabled equivalents. My chief complaint at the moment is that it is a bit hard to remember the
specific commands for showing remotes (`git annex info` has no equivalent `git info`) and `git annex remote`
should ideally return a list of remotes for parallelism.

Similarly, it'd be nice if some of the commands were a bit nested to match `git` semantics. This would increase discoverability:
For instance, `git annex enableremote` -> `git annex remote enable` or `git annex renameremote -> git annex remote rename`. Then subcommands for dealing with remotes
could be more easily summarized on a single page in the `git-annex-remote` section.

It's worth noting that such changes could happen alongside the current commands without a loss of functionality. Git core
has recently gone through a similar process to simplify the semantics of some of its commands. I'd ask for such changes to be considered.
