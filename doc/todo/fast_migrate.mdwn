dear Joey and everybody else,
 some time ago I used \"git annex migrate\" to bring all my repositories up-to-date; after that I found (to my dismay) that some keys are SHA256, some others are SHA256E, so my data is not really deduplicated  ; now, it would possible to migrate from SHAnnnE to SHAnnn (and vice versa) very fast... but currently AFAICS git-annex recomputes the whole checksum, and this (on my USB2.0 old disks) takes forever; may somebody please implement a fast migration?
