If spideroak has a CLI tool that can get/put/delete individual files, it should be quite easy to use [[the_external_special_remote|special_remotes/external]] to support it. The demo shell script could be used as a starting place.

I built that so that others can easily write special remotes, and so unless spideroak's CLI is free software, I don't anticipate working on this myself.
