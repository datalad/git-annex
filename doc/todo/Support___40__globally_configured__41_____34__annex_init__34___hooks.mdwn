The idea is stemmed from discussions/problems with using freeze/thaw hooks, and in particular [line of thinking in the comment on specify_freeze__47__thaw_scripts_relative_to_topdir](https://git-annex.branchable.com/todo/specify_freeze__47__thaw_scripts_relative_to_topdir/#comment-c71b25bbd0e3f018e07812965bd6a5b1).  ATM `git-annex` does analysis of either repository needs any special handling (adjusted branch, pidlock, etc) during `annex init` and otherwise does not bother.  It would make sense to make it possible for a user to also be able similarly to 

- test e.g. if custom freeze/thaw are needed (before even git annex decides to switch to adjusted branches mode) and setup that repo accordingly for git-annex to proceed without flipping out into adjusted branch mode
- may be improved/custom pidlock detection (on one of my servers I remember needing to just hardcode in ~/.gitconfig to use pidlock although that was relevant only for some paths).
- similarly do some other testing which could allow or disallow some git-annex decision such as e.g. use of adjusted unlocked branch
