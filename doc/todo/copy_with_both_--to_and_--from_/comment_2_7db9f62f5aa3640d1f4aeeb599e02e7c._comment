See [[todo/transitive_transfers]] for past discussion of this kind of
feature (and why supporting streaming would complicate git-annex significantly
for typically little gain).

The extra commits to the git-annex branch can be avoided by
annex.alwayscommit=false

I wonder to what extent alternating getting a file with sending it on
(and dropping it) would meet the use case? Are some files so large a single
file cannot fit in local storage at all?
