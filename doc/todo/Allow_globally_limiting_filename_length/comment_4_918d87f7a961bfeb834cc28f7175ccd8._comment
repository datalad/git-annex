If an update hook rejects a push, then `git annex sync` will just note that
it was unable to push. It will sync in only one direction until the problem
that prevents pushing gets resolved.

It might try pushing to a different branch name than usual to get around
some other problems that cause pushes to fail so be sure to have the update
hook check pushes to all branches (except for the git-annex branch)).

I don't know why you'd want to filter such a commit out of the git history.
You could just fix it by renaming the problem file and make a commit on top
of the problem commit. Just make the update hook only look at the diff
between the old version of the branch and the new version, so it won't be
tripped up by intermediate commits that violate its rules.

(I know that Ubuntu uses encfs or something like that by default, but
surely they have not removed the Debian installer's support for full
disk encryption?)
