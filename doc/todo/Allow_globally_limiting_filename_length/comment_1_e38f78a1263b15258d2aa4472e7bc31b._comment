Standard encfs warning: It's buggy and insecure. Don't use it.

You can find many other problems caused by encfs on this site, and 
<https://defuse.ca/audits/encfs.htm> has described security problems with
encfs for years.

It would not help for `git-annex add` to check some kind of filename limit,
because it would not prevent you doing this:

	git annex add smallenough
	git mv smallenough oh-oops-my-name-is-too-long-for-encfs
	git commit -m haha

A git pre-commit hook can of course be written that blocks such commits.

I am not inclined to complicate git-annex just to handle encfs given how
broken encfs is.
