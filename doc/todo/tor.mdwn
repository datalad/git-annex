git-annex sync over tor

Mostly working!

Current todo list:

* When a transfer can't be done because another transfer of the same 
  object is already in progress, the message about this is output by the
  remotedaemon --debug, but not forwarded to the peer, which shows
  "Connection reset by peer"
* Think about locking some more. What happens if the connection to the peer
  is dropped while we think we're locking content there from being dropped?
* Make remotedaemon connect to tor peers, notice when their repos have
  changed, and pull, like it does for ssh peers.

Eventually:

* Limiting authtokens to read-only access.
* Revoking authtokens. (This and read-only need a name associated with an
  authtoken, so the user can adjust its configuration after creating it.)
* address exchange via electrum-mnemonic or magic wormhole (see PAKE)
* webapp UI for easy pairing
* friend-of-a-friend peer discovery to build more interconnected networks
  of nodes
