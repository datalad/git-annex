Sounds absolutely awesome! The new `git annex satisfy` would also benefit from this. 

Also when thinking about a potential future `--dry-run` mode that wouldn't actually do stuff but in combination with `--explain` would display what it would do and why. I know dry-running can be nontrivial to implement, especially when actions change state. But imagine how cool it would be to do `git annex assist --dry-run --explain` and to see what exactly it *would* do (what files go to git, which to the annex, what files will be copied where, etc.) ðŸ¤©
