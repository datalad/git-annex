--explain now also shows when numcopies is taken into account when not
dropping, eg `get --auto`.

When dropping, git-annex already explains when numcopies is not satisfied
of course. As to displaying the drop safety proof, I think it's too much in
the weeds for a user to want it explained? Users probably don't want to
worry about the distinction between RecentlyVerifiedCopy and LockedCopy,
for example; those details are git-annex's job. It already gives a well
calibrated explanation when it can't drop, so explaining when it can drop
seems unncessary.

I also looked at adding it for file content checking, but inAnnex is pretty core
and is used in a lot of situations where --explain output would not be
useful, eg after git-annex has downloaded a file, it will check inAnnex.
While it would be possible to add something that explains that is only
called when deciding whether to operate on a file, that would be an
intrusive code change and would add complexity.

Also, while it can be confusing to users sometimes why eg `git-annex get
foo` doesn't output anything due to the file being present already, it
seems like adding --explain output to that would generally not be useful to
more experienced users. Explain needs to remain relatively concise, or it's
just more debug output.

So, closing this as completed, although of course more can be added
to --explain later..
