Termux is an android terminal with apt. It should be possible to build
git-annex this way, and this would be a nice alternative (or perhaps
replacement) for the git-annex.apk.

Looks like termux uses ubuntu to build, but cross-compiles for android,
using bionic. So, ghc-android would still need to be used to build
git-annex.

May be easier to build an appropriate .deb from the android git-annex
binary, and add it to termux's sources.list?

This would also help with [[tor]] support on android, since termux has a
tor package. And would avoid needing to bundle other 
often out of date stuff with git-annex.apk.
