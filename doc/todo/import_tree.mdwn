When `git annex export treeish --to remote` is used to export to a remote,
and the remote allows files to somehow be edited on it, then there ought
to be a way to import the changes back from the remote into the git repository.
The command could be `git annex import --from remote`

There also ought to be a way to make `git annex sync` automatically import.

See [[design/importing_trees_from_special_remotes]] for the design for
this.

Status: Basic git annex export treeish --to remote` is working,
and `git annex sync --content` can be configured to use it.

## remaining todo

* S3 buckets can be set up to allow reads and listing by an anonymous user.
  That should allow importing from such a bucket, but the S3 remote
  will need changes, since it currently avoids using the S3 API when
  it does not have creds.

* Allow configuring importtree=yes w/o exporttree=yes, for eg anonymous S3
  bucket import.
  
  Note that in S3, this should let unversioned buckets be used  w/o --force.

* Write a tip or tips to document using this new feature.
  (Have one for adb now, but not for S3.)

* Add to external special remote protocol.

* Support importing from webdav, etc?
  Problem is that these may have no way to avoid an export
  overwriting changed content that would have been imported otherwise.
  So if they're supported the docs need to reflect the problem so the user
  avoids situations that cause data loss, or decides to accept the
  possibility of data loss.

* When on an adjusted unlocked branch, need to import the files unlocked.
  Also, the tracking branch code needs to know about such branches,
  currently it will generate the wrong tracking branch.

  The test case for `export_import` currently has a line commented out
  that fails on adjusted unlocked branches.

  Alternatively, could not do anything special for adjusted branches,
  so generating a non-adjusted branch, and require the user use `git annex
  sync` to merge in that branch. Rationalle: After fetching from a normal
  git repo in an adjusted branch, merging does the same thing, and the docs
  say to use `git annex sync` instead. Any improvments to that workflow
  (like eg a way to merge a specified branch and update the adjustment)
  would thus benefit both uses cases.

* Need to support annex.largefiles when importing.

* If a tree containing a non-annexed file is exported,
  and then an import is done from the remote, the new tree will have that
  file annexed, and so merging it converts to annexed (there is no merge
  conflict). This problem seems hard to avoid, other than relaying on
  annex.largefiles to tell git-annex if a file should be imported
  non-annexed. 
  
  Although.. The importer could check for each file,
  if there's a corresponding file in the branch it's generating the 
  import for, if that file is annexed. But this might be slow and seems a
  lot of bother for an edge case?

## race conditions

(Some thoughts about races that the design should cover now, but kept here
for reference.)

A file could be modified on the remote while
it's being exported, and if the remote then uses the mtime of the modified
file in the content identifier, the modification would never be noticed by
imports. 

To fix this race, we need an atomic move operation on the remote. Upload
the file to a temp file, then get its content identifier, and then move it
from the temp file to its final location. Alternatively, upload a file and
get the content identifier atomically, which eg S3 with versioning enabled
provides. It would make sense to have the storeExport operation always return
a content identifier and document that it needs to get it atomically by
either using a temp file or something specific to the remote.

----

There's also a race where a file gets changed on the remote after an
import tree, and an export then overwrites it with something else.

One solution would be to only allow one of importtree or exporttree
to a given remote. This reduces the use cases a lot though, and perhaps
so far that the import tree feature is not worth building. The adb
special remote needs both. Also, such a limitation seems like one that
users might try to work around by initializing two remotes using the same
data and trying to use one for import and the other for export.

Really fixing this race needs locking or an atomic operation. Locking seems
unlikely to be a portable enough solution.

An atomic rename operation could at least narrow the race significantly, eg:

1. get content identifier of $file, check if it's what was expected else
   abort (optional but would catch most problems)
2. upload new version of $file to $tmp1
3. rename current $file to $tmp2
4. Get content identifier of $tmp2, check if it's what was expected to
   be. If not, $file was modified after the last import tree, and that
   conflict has to be resolved. Otherwise, delete $tmp2
5. rename $tmp1 to $file

That leaves a race if the file gets overwritten after it's moved out
of the way. If the rename refuses to overwrite existing files, that race
would be detected by it failing. renameat(2) with `RENAME_NOREPLACE` can do that, 
but probably many special remote interfaces don't provide a way to do that.

S3 lacks a rename operation, can only copy and then delete. Which is not
good enough; it risks the file being replaced with new content before
the delete and the new content being deleted.

Is this race really a significant problem? One way to look at it is
analagous to a git merge overwriting a locally modified file.
Git can certianly use similar techniques to entirely detect and recover
from such races (but not the similar race described in the next section). 
But, git does not actually do that! I modified git's
merge.c to sleep for 10 seconds after `refresh_index()`, and verified
that changes made to the work tree in that window were silently overwritten
by git merge. In git's case, the race window is normally quite narrow
and this is very unlikely to happen (the similar race described in the next
section is more likely). 

If git-annex could get the race window similarly small out would perhaps be
ok. Eg:

1. upload new version of $file to $tmp
2. get content identifier of $file, check if it's what was expected else
   abort
3. rename (or copy and delete) $tmp to $file

The race window between #2 and #3 could be quite narrow for some remotes.
But S3, lacking a rename, does a copy that can be very slow for large files.

S3, with versioning, could detect the race after the fact, by listing
the versions of the file, and checking if any of the versions is one
that git-annex did not know the file already had.
[Using this api](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/RESTBucketGETVersion.html),
with version-id-marker set to the previous version of the file,
should list only the previous and current versions; if there's an
intermediate version then the race occurred and it could roll the change
back, or otherwise recover the overwritten version. This could be done at
import time, to detect a previous race, and recover from it; importing
a tree with the file(s) that were overwritten due to the race, leading to a
tree import conflict that the user can resolve. This likely generalizes
to importing a sequence of trees, so each version written to S3 gets
imported.

----

A remaining race is that, if the file is open for write at the same
time it's renamed, the write might happen after the content identifer
is checked, and then whatever is written to it will be lost. 

But: Git worktree update has the same race condition. Verified with
this perl oneliner, run in a worktree and a second later 
followed by a git pull. The lines that it appended to the 
file got lost:

	perl -e 'open (OUT, ">>foo") || die "$!"; sleep(10); while (<>) { print OUT $_ }'

Since this is acceptable in git, I suppose we can accept it here too..

## S3 versioning and import

Listing a versioned S3 bucket with past versions results in S3 sending
a list that's effectively:

	foo current-version
	foo past-version
	bar deleted
	bar past-version
	bar even-older-version

Each item on the list also has a LastModified date, and IsLatest
is set for the current version of each file.

This needs to be converted into a ImportableContents tree of file trees.

Getting the current file tree is easy, just filter on IsLatest.

Getting the past file trees seems hard. Two things are in tension:

* Want to generate the same file tree in this import that was used in past
  imports. Since the file tree is converted to a git tree, this avoids
  a proliferation of git trees.

* Want the past file trees to reflect what was actually in the
  S3 bucket at different past points in time. 
  
So while it would work fine to just make one past file tree for each
file, that contains only that single file, the user would not like
the resulting history when they explored it with git.

With the example above, the user expects something like this:

  	ImportableContents [(foo, current-version)]
		[ ImportableContents [(foo, past-version), (bar, past-version)]
			[ ImportableContents [(bar, even-older-version)]
				[]
			]
		]

And the user would like for the inner-most list to also include
(foo, past-version) if it were in the S3 bucket at the same time
(bar, even-older-version) was added. So depending on the past 
modificatio times of foo vs bar, they may really expect:

  	let l = ImportableContents [(foo, current-version)]
		[ ImportableContents [(foo, past-version), (bar, past-version)]
			[ ImportableContents [(foo, past-version), (bar, even-older-version)]
				[ ImportableContents [(foo, past-version)]
					[]
				]
			]
		]
  	
Now, suppose that foo is deleted and subsequently bar is added back,
so S3 now sends this list:

	bar new-version
	bar deleted
	bar past-version
	bar even-older-version
	foo deleted
	foo current-version
	foo past-version

The user would expect this to result in:

	ImportableContents [(bar, new-version)]
		[ ImportableContents []
			l
		]

But l needs to be the same as the l above to avoid git trees proliferation.

What is the algorythm here?

1. Build a list of files with historical versions ([[a]]). 
2. Extract a snapshot from the list
3. Remove too new versions from the list
4. Recurse with the new list.

Extracting a snapshot:

Map over the list, taking the head version of each item and tracking
the most recent modification time. Add the filenames to a snapshot list
(unless the item is a deletion).

Removing too new versions:

Map over the list, and when the head version of a file matches the most
recent modification time, pop it off.

This results in a list that is only versions before the snapshot.

Overall this is perhaps a bit better than O(n^2) because the size of the list
decreases as it goes?
