Well, calckey's behavior is influenced by the annex.backends setting,
so it might behave differently when run in a different git repo, or outside
any git repo.

In fact, `git annex calckey` currently can be run in a git repo that is not
a git-annex repo; it does not check if the repo is initialized for
git-annex (which many commands do). The failure about "Not in a git
repository." comes when it tries to run code in the Annex monad, which 
requires a git repository.

To support being run without being in a git repo at all would
really need an entirely separate code path to be implemented, not using the
Annex monad, and so necessarily not looking at git configs. It's doable,
but it would be a lot of work; I'd need some convincing motivation to add
a lot of code to accomplish that.
