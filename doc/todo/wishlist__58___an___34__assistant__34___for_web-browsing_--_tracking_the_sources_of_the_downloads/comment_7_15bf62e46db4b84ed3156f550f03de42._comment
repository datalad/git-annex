A less round-about method would be to have the webapp listen for links dropped into its page. You could then have the webapp open in a tab, and just drag urls there to add them to the annex.

I'm not sure if it's possible to intercept drags into a tab. Default browser behavior is certainly to redirect the tab to the url dropped into it.

If someone finds out how to do this, I will build it.
