So I've just written a two-line shell script that makes [FlashGot](http://flashgot.net/) able to do this. It's available on GitHub at <https://gist.github.com/andyg0808/5342434>.

This could be even neater if Git-annex had the ability to set the download manager... Wishlist created: [[wishlist:_allow_configuration_of_downloader_for_addurl]]
