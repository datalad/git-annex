Adding a relaxed url currently prevents verifying the content of the object
when transferring it between repositories. This risks data corruption going
unnoticed. Could the hash be recorded when a relaxed url is downloaded from
the web, and then used for verification of other transfers?

This would need a new per-key file in the git-annex branch, that can list
one or more hash-based keys. Then implement verification for url keys, that
checks if hash-based keys are recorded in the file, and if so uses them to
verify the content.

The web special remote can hash the content as it's downloading it from the
web, and record the resulting hash-based key.

## handling upgrades

A repository that currently contains the content of a relaxed url needs to
keep working. So, the object stored in the repository has to be treated as
valid, even though it does not correspond to any hash-based keys listed for
the url key. 

This presents a problem; there is no way to tell the difference between
a valid object in such a repository and an object that was downloaded from
the web with its hash recorded, but has since gotten corrupted.

Seems that the only possible way to resolve this problem is to change to a
new type of url key, that is known to always have its hash recorded on
download from the web. (Call this a verifiable url key: a VURL.)
And handle all existing relaxed url keys as before.

That would leave it up to the user to migrate their URL keys to
VURL keys, if desired. Now that distributed migration is
implemented, that seems sufficiently easy.

See [[migration_to_VURL_by_default]]

## addurl --fast 

Using addurl --fast rather than --relaxed records the size but doesn't
hash. So it has the same problem that data corruption can go unnoticed,
only the data corruption has to involve bit flips and not truncation.

So it seems that --fast ought to also be handled. The difference being that
an url added with --fast is expected to always be the same on re-download
from the web, while an url added with --relaxed may change its content on
re-download from the web while being still considered the same object.

This can also use a VURL key, but include the size in it. When downloading
a sized VURL, the web special remote will hash the content, and verify
that either no hash has been recorded before (and record the hash when the
size matches), or that it matches the previously recorded hash.

Note that, if an url is added with --fast and that gets committed and
pulled by another repo, and then later both repos download the content
from the web, it would be possible for the web to serve up different
content to the two, and in that case either hash would be treated as
valid.

## other special remotes

If the web special remote is what takes care of hashing the content on
download and recording the hash-based key, what about other special remotes
that claim an url?

This could also be implemented in the bittorrent special remote
(though ), but what
about external special remotes?

An alternative would be to add a downloadVerifiedUrl that is called instead
of retrieveKeyFile and returns a hash-based key (allowing hashing the
download on the fly). Then git-annex would take
care of recording the hash-based key. The external special remote interface
could be extended to include that.

## hash-based key choice

Should annex.backend gitconfig be used to pick which hash-based key to use?
The risk is that config changes and several different hash-based keys get
recorded for a VURL. Not really a problem, but would increase the
size of the git-annex branch unncessarily, and require extra work when
verifying the key.)

What if annex.backend uses WORM or something that is not hash-based?
Seems it ought to fall back to SHA256 or something then.

To support annex.securehashesonly it would be good if only
cryptographically secure hashes were recorded for a VURL. But of course,
which hashes are considered secure can change. Still, let's start by
only allowing currently secure hashes to be used for VURLs. This way,
when there are multiple hashes recorded for a VURL, they will all be
cryptographically secure normally, and so the VURL can be considered
cryptographically secure itself. If any of the hashes later becomes
broken, the VURL will no longer be treated as cryptographically secure,
because the broken hash can be used to verify its content.
In that case, the user would probably just migrate to a hash-based key,
although perhaps something VURL-specific could be built to upgrade its
hashes.

## use for other types of keys

It would also be possible to use these new git-annex branch log files
for other types of keys, like WORM, or perhaps SHA1. But, the same upgrade
problem would apply. So, there's problably no benefit in doing that,
compared with migrating the key to the desired hash backend.

Does seem to be some chance this could help implementing 
[[wishlist_degraded_files]].

## security

There is the potential for a loop, where a VURL has recorded an equivilant
key what is the same VURL, or another VURL in a loop. Leading to a crafted
git-annex branch that DOSes git-annex.

To avoid this, any VURL in equivilant keys will be ignored.
