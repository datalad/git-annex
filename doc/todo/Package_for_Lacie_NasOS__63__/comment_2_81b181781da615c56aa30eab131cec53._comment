Yes it is Linux:

$ uname -a
Linux nas 3.10.59-svn15282 #1 SMP Fri Jul 31 13:36:10 UTC 2015 x86_64 GNU/Linux

But it does not have apt. And probably not a compiler either.

Is it complicated to install a compiled version manually? Or is it \"self-containing\"? Any instructions for cross compiling on a Mac?
