We are 
- creating git-annex repositories by minting annex keys based on metadata (size, filename extension, checksum) which we share on  https://github.com/dandisets/ and https://github.com/dandizarrs .
- back them up as a tandem of `annex get` following by `annex move --to=backup` commands.

That results 
- temporarily first fully populate those datasets (could be TBs in size)
- for every annexed key to have two commits to adjust the state of that key in git-annex branch -- first to announce local availability and then that it moved to another remote

Ideally I would have loved if I could just say something like `git annex copy --from=someremote --to=backup .` or even better just smth like `git annex copy --auto-get --to=backup . ` and ensure that 
- we get the file before moving it to backup
- we do not bother recording in git-annex that the file ever existed locally

NB may be some `annex sync` would do that magic?
