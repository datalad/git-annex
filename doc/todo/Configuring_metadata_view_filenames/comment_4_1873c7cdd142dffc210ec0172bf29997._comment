True, it could use a bloom filter.

I had not thought of `/=*` (or forgot about it). Views could, as a special
case, use the original paths in that case. That's getting very close to
adjusted branch territory, and I want to rewrite the view branch generation
code to use adjusted branches eventually (so changes made in the view
branch can be propigated back out to the source branch and so view branches
can be updated when the source branch changes).
