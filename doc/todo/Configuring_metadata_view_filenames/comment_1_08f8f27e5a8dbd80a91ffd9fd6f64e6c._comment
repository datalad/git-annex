git-annex really doesn't care what filenames are used with in a view.
It only needs to ensure that each file gets a unique filename. Which
is why the directory is included in the filename, to avoid conflicts
if 2 files with the same name appear in different directories.

It would probably be better to make it avoid needing to include the
directory in the filename unless there is such a conflict, rather than
adding complexity configuring that.

However, since views are currently built by streaming the contents of the
branch to git update-index, git-annex can't just eg, examine the working
tree to see if a conflicting file exists. It seems it would need to keep
a map of the files it's added to the view branch so far, and check against
the map. But that would make memory use scale with the number of files in
the view, which I'd prefer to avoid..

I'm going to move this from bugs to todo.
