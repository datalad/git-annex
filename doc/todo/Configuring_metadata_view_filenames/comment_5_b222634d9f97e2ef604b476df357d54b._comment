Has the format been changed since this previously asked? I am currently trying to leverage git-annex and its metadata views with AI tooling, but the format seems to be filename_%path%, resulting in the extension being in the middle of the path. I have set `annex.maxextensionlength` to `12` so the extensions are present on the files in the backend.

    $ git annex view type=model model/=*
    $ ls -lr
    .:
    sd
    
    ./sd:
    v1.4.safetensors_%model%sd%  v1.5.safetensors_%model%sd%

whereas I would expect (or rather, I am trying to achieve):

    $ ls -lr
    .:
    sd
    
    ./sd:
    v1.4.safetensors  v1.5.safetensors
