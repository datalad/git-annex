So if my understanding is correct, the file paths generated for this view should something like `sd/v1.5_%model%.safetensors` but as `annex.maxextensionlength` isn't being considered during this, it doesn't realise `safetensors` is the extension?

Unfortunately, the software will only regard certain extensions as being usable files, so I will be unable to use metadata views for now. I've set up separate branches and will copy symlinks between branches in the meantime.
