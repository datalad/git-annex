Note that `git-annex` intentionally does not operate on pathspecs, 
which is being discussed in
<https://git-annex.branchable.com/bugs/get__47__metadata__47____63____63____63____58___does_not_handle_pathspec_correct/>

It is possible to use eg `git-annex get --branch foo:subdir/` to operate
on a subdirectory, which is enough in many situations. 
But what you're looking for is pathspec style filtering.
I do see the benefit.

`git ls-tree` also doesn't have a way to filter by pathspec, and that's
what `--branch` uses. So it would require git-annex reimplement git's
pathspecs, which seem complicated and not very well documented. Or there
would need to be a way to pass the paths through some other git command
to handle the pathspec. I don't know what git command might be able to be
used to do that.
