I think the assistant should have a delay before starting so it doesn't impact on the system boot performance.

I know this can be configured per user (I have it set to 5min), but I think 2min is a sane default.

I don't really know how to submit patches (I can't attach it), so I simply copy it here. It's trivial enough.
