`git annex sync --content` operates on the whole work tree, not only the
current directory. This is different than other git-annex commands, and
makes sense in a way since git pull works like that too. But, sometimes
I only want the content of a single directory, or perhaps file. 

This could be implemented as `git annex sync --content thedir`, except
that would conflict with the name of the remote to sync with that it
currently takes. Perhaps `git annex sync --dir==thedir`, which
automatically enables content syncing?
