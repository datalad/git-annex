I wish we were talking about a \"new functionality\" (as if in times of adding `add --batch`) -- then may be `--json` output could introduce some new semantic for `add --json` to respond with smth like

```
{\"command\":\"add\",\"success\":true,\"input\":[\"directory/\"],\"error-messages\":[],\"file\": []}

```

thus signaling with `\"file\": []` that no files were added for that `input`. For the files which were added, it would provide one response per file (cannot populate \"file\" since can be too long)
