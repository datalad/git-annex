I do think there is value in the simplicity of the current json, even if a
"better" one could be constructed if we did not need to worry about
backwards compatability. A new JSON object that was only seen when
recursing a directory would need to be documented, otherwise a JSON user
would be likely to only implement support for the JSON objects they did see.
