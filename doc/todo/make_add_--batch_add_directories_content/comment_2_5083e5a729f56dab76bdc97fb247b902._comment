The reason it does not recurse is that would make the number of lines/json
records of output vary depending on the number of files in the directory.
Which would complicate parsing git-annex's output.

`git-annex add` is not actually special here. You can't
pass a directory to `git-annex drop --batch` either.

It seems to me that it's not hard to recurse directories yourself, and so
it's better to offload the need to do that onto users of --batch, rather
than making them deal with increased parsing complexity.
