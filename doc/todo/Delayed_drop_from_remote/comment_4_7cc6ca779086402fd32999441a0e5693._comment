Yes, the trashbin remote could be private. I think we're in agreement
that's the best way to go.

--accessedwithin relies on atime, and looks at objects in the local
repository only, so it would not work to find objects in the trashbin
remote.

I don't think there is anything in preferred content
expressions that would meet your need here exactly. It would probably be
possible to add an expression that matches objects that have been present
in a given repository for a given amount of time. The presence logs do have a
timestamp.

Of course, if you used a directory special remote you could use
plain old `find`.
