Actually I have gone ahead an implemented some
[[git-annex-matching-options]] that will be useful
in finding content to drop from the trashbin: 
`--presentsince --lackingsince --changedsince`

You might use, for example: 

	git-annex drop --force --from trashbin \
		--presentsince=trashbin:7d --and --not --changedsince=here:7d

That will match files that were moved to the trashbin 7 days ago,
and that have not re-entered the current repository in the time since then.
