annex.trashbin is implemented.

I am going to close this todo; if it turns out there is some preferred
content improvement that would help with cleaning out the trash, let's talk
about that on a new todo. But I'm guessing you'll make do with `find`.

With a private remote it's reasonably invisible. The very observant user
might notice a drop time that scales with the size of the file being
dropped and be able to guess this feature is being used. And, if there is
some error when it tries to move the object to the remote, the drop will
fail. The error message in that case cannot really obscure the fact that
annex.trashbin is configured.
