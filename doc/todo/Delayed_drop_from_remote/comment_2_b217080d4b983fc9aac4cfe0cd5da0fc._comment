A third approach would be to have a config setting that makes dropped
objects be instead moved to a remote. So the drop would succeed, but
whereis would indicate that the object was being retained there. Then
a cron job on the remote could finish the deletions.

This would not be singifinantly more heavyweight than just moving to a
directory, if you used eg a directory special remote. And it's also a lot
more flexible.

Of course, this would make dropping take longer than usual, depending on
how fast the object could be moved to the remote. If it were slow, there
would be no way to convey progress back to the user without a lot more
complication than this feature warrants.

Open to your thoughts on these alternatives..
