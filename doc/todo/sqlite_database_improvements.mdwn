Collection of non-ideal things about git-annex's use of sqlite databases.
Would be good to improve these sometime, but it would need a migration
process.

* Database.Export.getExportedKey would be faster if there was an index
  in the database, eg "ExportedIndex file key". This only affects
  the speed of `git annex export`, which is probably swamped by the actual
  upload of the data to the remote.

* There may be other selects elsewhere that are not indexed.

* Database.Types has some suboptimal encodings for Key and InodeCache.
  They are both slow due to being implemented using String
  (which may be fixable w/o changing the DB schema),
  and the VARCHARs they generate are longer than necessary
  since they look like eg `SKey "whatever"` and `I "whatever"`

* SFilePath is stored efficiently, and has to be a String anyway,
  (until ByteStringFilePath is used)
  but since it's stored as a VARCHAR, which sqlite interprets using the
  current locale, there can be encoding problems. This is at least worked
  around with a hack that escapes FilePaths that contain unusual
  characters. It would be much better to use a BLOB.

  Also, when LANG=C is sometimes used, the hack can result in duplicates with
  different representations of the same filename, like this:

	INSERT INTO associated VALUES(4,'SHA256E-s30--7d51d2454391a40e952bea478e45d64cf0d606e1e8c0652bb815a22e0e23419a,'foo.ü');
	INSERT INTO associated VALUES(5,'SHA256E-s30--7d51d2454391a40e952bea478e45d64cf0d606e1e8c0652bb815a22e0e23419a','"foo.\56515\56508"');

  See <http://git-annex.branchable.com/bugs/assistant_crashes_in_TransferScanner/>
  for an example of how this can happen.

  And it seems likely that a query by filename would fail if the filename
  was in the database but with a different encoding.

* IKey could fail to round-trip as well, when a Key contains something
  (eg, a filename extension) that is not valid in the current locale,
  for similar reasons to SFilePath. Using BLOB would be better.

  See [[!commit cf260d9a159050e2a7e70394fdd8db289c805ec3]] for details
  about the encoding problem for SFilePath. I reproduced a similar problem
  for IKey by making a file `foo.ü` and running `git add` on  it in a unicode
  locale. Then with LANG=C, `git annex drop --force foo.ü` thinks
  it drops the content, but in fact the work tree file is left containing
  the dropped content. The database then contained:

	INSERT INTO associated VALUES(8,'SHA256E-s30--59594eea8d6f64156b3ce6530cc3a661739abf2a0b72443de8683c34b0b19344.ü','foo.ü');
	INSERT INTO associated VALUES(9,'SHA256E-s30--59594eea8d6f64156b3ce6530cc3a661739abf2a0b72443de8683c34b0b19344.��','"foo.\56515\56508"');
