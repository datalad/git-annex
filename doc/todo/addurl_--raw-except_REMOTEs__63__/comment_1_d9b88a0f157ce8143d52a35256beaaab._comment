Seems pretty reasonable.

--raw-except=bittorrent would handle bittorrent, no special case needed for
that.

Since yt-dlp is effectively part of the web special remote (despite being
implemented as a special case in addurl), seems reasonable to make
--raw-except=web disable other special remotes while still letting yt-dlp
be used for appropriate urls.

Implemented.
