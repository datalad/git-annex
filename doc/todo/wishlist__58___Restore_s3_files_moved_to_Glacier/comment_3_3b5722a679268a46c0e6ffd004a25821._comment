If one `git-annex get` starts a restore, then a while later,
but before the restore is done, `git-annex get` is run again,
sending RestoreObject again will change the lifetime of the restored
object. This seems like something to at least warn users about,
since it could cost money to leave restored objects in the S3 bucket
longer than necessary.
