Glacier is in the process of being deprecated, instead there is 
the Deep Archive S3 storage class.
<https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-amazon-s3-storage-class-glacier-deep-archive/>

While it is possible to configure a S3 special remote
with `storageclass=DEEP_ARCHIVE`, or configure a bucket with lifecycle rules
to move objects to deep archive, git-annex won't be able to retrieve objects
stored in deep archive.

To support that, the S3 special remote would need to send a request to S3 to
RESTORE an object from deep archive. Then later (on a subsequent `git-annex` run)
GET the object from S3.

And then after getting the object, it would be left in the S3 bucket rather
than in deep archive, so something would need to deal with that to move it
back into deep archive. Either git-annex could do it, or a lifecycle rule could.
