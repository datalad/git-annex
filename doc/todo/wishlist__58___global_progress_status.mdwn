similar to [[do_not_bug_me_about_intermediate_files]] - i feel that massive `git annex get` operations should have better progress information than the current individual `rsync --progress` bits. i wonder if this couldn't be accomplished with `rsync --info=PROGRESS2`, which gives overall rsync progress, combined with copying multiple files at once with rsync (which would have the side-effect of speeding up `git annex get` for large number of small files).

once this is done, it could be sent back to the webapp UI to give the user a global sense of the overall sync progress (as opposed to per-file progress). --[[anarcat]]
