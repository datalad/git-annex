These are all valid reasons to retire the webapp. The webapp lacks many features that it would need to be really useful. Also creation of new repos or addition of existing repos into the webapp is not as straightforward as it should be to make it similar in usability like e.g. syncthing.

I do still use it for shared family folders on my and their machines. It's nice to have something to tell people to click on, then something happens and they can see if syncing works or does anything. `git annex info` is not quite the same, though it shows active transfers.

What I would love to see as a replacement for the webapp is a command like `git annex assistant-status` that maybe outputs as json of human-readable text what the assitant currently does (pulling, merging, pushing to which remote, downloading, uploading, etc.), all the stuff that was nicely visible in the webapp. (Does this exist already? ðŸ¤”)

Furthermore, a command like `git annex activity` that goes arbitrarily far back in time and statically (non-live) lists recent activities like:

- yesterday 23:32: remote1 downloaded 5 files (45MB)
- today 10:45: you modified file `document.txt` (10MB)
- today 10:46: you uploaded file `document.txt` (from today 10:45) to remote1, remote2 and remote3
- today 12:35: Fred McGitFace modified file `document.txt` (12MB) and uploaded to remote2
- ...

Basically a human-readable (or as JSON), chronological log of things that happened in the repo. This is a superpower of git-annex: all this information is available as far back as one wants, we just don't have a way to access it nicely. `git log` and `git annex log` exist, but they are too specific, too broad or a bit hard to parse on their own. For example:

- `git annex activity --since=\"2 weeks ago\" --include='*.doc'` would list things (who committed, which remote received it, etc.) that happened in the last two weeks to *.doc files
- `git annex activity --only-annex --in=remote2` would list recent annex operations (in the `git-annex` branch only) of remote2
- `git annex activity --only-changes --largerthan=10MB` would list recent file changes (additions, modifications, deletions, etc., in `git log` only)

This `git annex assistant-log` and `git annex activity` would be a very nice feature to showcase git-annex's power (which other file syncing tool can to this? ðŸ¤”) and also solve [[todo/Recent_remote_activities]].
