As part of removing the webapp, I patched Alerts out of the assistant in 
[[!commit 33cf88c8b8962a7f5d3b3caada95890d5f4d377e]].

It did occur to me that logging the text of the Alert might make the
assistant's log more useful. That commit would be an easy starting point to
adding such logging.

I don't think it solves [[todo/Recent_remote_activities]] though because
it would only show activity by the assistant, not by other commands, and
not activity that happened in other clones of the repository.
