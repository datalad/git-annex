OK, I verified that what you accomplished also works on my end. This must be yet another gotcha related to my [previous issue regarding imports](https://git-annex.branchable.com/forum/Import_-_Changing_Largefiles/): once something is imported it is not possible to attempt a \"clean\" re-import. At some point in my initial testing I must have accidentally imported the files ignored at `foo/*.c` (`root-ignore/c` in my case) and from there I could not get those files not to import once again.
