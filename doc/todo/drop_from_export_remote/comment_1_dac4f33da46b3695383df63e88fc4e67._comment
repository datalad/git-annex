Rather than altering the exported git tree, it could removeExport and then
update the export log to say that the export is incomplete. 

That would result in a re-export putting the file back on the remote.

It's not uncommon to eg want to `git-annex move foo --from remote`,
due to it being low on space, or to temporarily make it unavailable,
and later send the file back to the remote. Supporting drop from export
remotes in this way would allow for such a workflow, although with the
difference that `git-annex export` would be needed to put the file back.

It might also be possible to make sending a particular file to an export 
remote succeed when the export to the remote is incomplete and the file is
in the exported tree. Then `git-annex move foo --to remote` would work to
put the file back.
