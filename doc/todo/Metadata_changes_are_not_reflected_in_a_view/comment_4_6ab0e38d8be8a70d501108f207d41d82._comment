`git-annex sync` when in a view branch will now update it.

Leaving this open for optimising it.

Also because of this problem:

	joey@darkstar:~/tmp/m#master(author=_)>git-annex sync
	commit
	On branch views/master(author=_)
	nothing to commit, working tree clean
	ok
	merge synced/master
	fatal: refusing to merge unrelated histories
	failed

Looks like it should not be trying to merge the synced/master
branch into the view branch. But, this makes me wonder, does the master branch
get updated with new files pulled from remotes? If not, the view branch
won't be updated to have them either.

Also, I think that it may try to import trees from importree special remotes,
into the view branch. Perhaps those should also get imported but merged into
the master branch...
