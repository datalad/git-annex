This might be worth adding. But, one of the ways views can be used
is to use file operations to adjust the metadata that is being viewed.

So, when you delete a file from a view, and git commit, git-annex
will remove the metadata that had made the file be in the view.

And, if you copy or move a file in a view to a different subdirectory,
and add and git commit the change, the metadata will be updated to
update the metadata to reflect the files new location.

As such, I see this as a wishlist todo item at best, and will move it from
the bugs list to the todo list.
