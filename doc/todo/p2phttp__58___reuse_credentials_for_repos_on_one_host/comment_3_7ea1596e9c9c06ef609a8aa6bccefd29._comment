credential.useHttpPath is the relevant git config for this git-credential
behavior.

I think it would be reasonable for git-annex to check if that is false, and
if so, remove the path from the `git credential` request for an annex+http
url.

But I agree, it would be better, in the vast majority of cases, to have a 
single url endpoint that serves multiple repositories.

And for that matter, if someone is running git-annex p2phttp to serve 2
different repositories right now, they are probably making the two listen
on different ports and so removing the path wouldn't help. They would have
to be interposing another web server that mapped those ports to paths, like
you have done with forgejo-aneksajo, for the path mangling to help.

So implementing [[todo/p2phttp_serve_multiple_repositories]]
seems better than adding such path mangling.
