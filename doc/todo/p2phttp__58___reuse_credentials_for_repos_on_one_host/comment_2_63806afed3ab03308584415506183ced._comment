Unfortunately, remote.foo.annexUrl is not limited to use for p2phttp. It
existed before that and could be legitimately set to a http url when
p2phttp is not being used.

I agree it would be good to try to reuse the credentials of the git url for
p2phttp. That could be done by just querying git credential for the git url
credentials, and trying to use them for the p2phttp url. If they don't work,
use git credential to prompt for the p2phttp url credentials as it does now.

If the user had credential.helper configured, they would probably already
have the git credentials cached, and if not, this would cache them for
later use, so no harm done asking for them. But if credential.helper was
not configured, there would be an extra and wholly unncessary password
prompt. 

So, I think it makes sense to only do this when credential.helper is
configured. And when the hostname is the same in both the git url
and the p2phttp url.
