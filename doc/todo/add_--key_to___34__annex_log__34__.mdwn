NAME
       git-annex-log - shows location log information

SYNOPSIS
       git annex log [path ...]

```

although quite often desired to check by the key which might not even be in the tree. `whereis` ( a sister command for similar investigations ) has `--key`, so I thought it would be great to get it here too.

In my case -- doing archaeology on AFNI's test data in [https://github.com/afni/afni/pull/656](https://github.com/afni/afni/pull/656).
