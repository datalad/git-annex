When a VURL key has multiple equivilant keys that all use the same hash,
verifying the VURL key currently has to verify each equivilant key.
Usually that is done incrementally, so it only has to read the file once. But it
still does redundant work, updating each incremental verifier with each
chunk.

This could be improved by caclulating a hash once, and then compare it
with a hash value exposed by the Backend. That seems doable but will mean
extending the Backend interface, to expose the hash value and type.
