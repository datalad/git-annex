What about having a direct more in an external work tree?

I could have my .git directory in some local directory (say
`~/.git-annex/remote-mp3.git`) and the actual files on the device (say
`/media/anarcat/mounted/mp3`).

I know that there are many possible names for a single key, but isn't
that a problem for direct mode as well?

And I know it's a poney... I keep on asking for poneys here, but
poneys are great, and actually quite useful and even friendly animals
if you can use and take care of them correctly. :)
