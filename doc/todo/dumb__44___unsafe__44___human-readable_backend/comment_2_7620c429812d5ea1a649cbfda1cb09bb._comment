Dear anarcat, I totally understand your use case since I often get into situations like that. I think that, by design (content addressable storage etc.), git-annex is not at all suited to fulfill this use case.

I managed to use a combination of a fuse mount and unison to reach that use case.

I create a fuse view of the git annex working copy with pyfs (http://pyfilesystem.org/) via a command line like : fsmount -f -a file:///my_git_annex_working_copy my_share_directory

Generally, I share the fuse mount over samba, ftp and http.

In order to synchronize with a distant directory (the use case you mentioned), I use another fuse mount and unison to sync both.

Generally, I share the content on a remote samba server, using: 'smbnetfs ~/Network' and then 'unison my_share_directory ~/Network/PathToTheRemote'

In the case of a s3 drive, I don't know the details since I never went there, but you could try: 'fsmount -f -a s3:///my_s3_remote my_s3_directory', then 'unison my_share_directory my_s3_directory'

You may think that all those mounts are difficult to manage. As a matter of fact, I use supervisord (http://supervisord.org/) that helps making sure that everything is running OK. I have been using that setup for a few years now, without trouble.

I hope that I could help.
