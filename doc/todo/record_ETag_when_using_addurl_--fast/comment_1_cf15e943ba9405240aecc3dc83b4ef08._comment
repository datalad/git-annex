Etags are intended to help http clients with caching. It would
not be considered much of a problem if a web server only returned the same
Etag for a little while and then generated a new one later, since clients
only cache so long anyway. But then git-annex would treat the file as no
longer present on the website.

Apache uses the inode, size, and mtime for its Etag generation. So just
moving a website to a different drive would change the Etag.
