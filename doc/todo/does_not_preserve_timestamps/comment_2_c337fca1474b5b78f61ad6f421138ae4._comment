Thanks Joey for the comment. 

But when syncing two repos, timestamps are critical at least for my use case. I can't lose this info. Even if it's expensive. 

Appreciate if you can consider to add it for direct mode repos, ie when a file is synced to another repo and created there, it shall carry at least the mtime of the file in source repo. Owncloud sync does it, btsync does it, although I know git-annex is different than those.
