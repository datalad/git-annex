The closest git comes to storing a timestamp is the date of the last commit of a file for mtime, and first commit for ctime. However, those are pretty expensive to look up for a given file. And git doesn't try to preserve timestamps in checkouts at all, which argues that git-annex, at least at the command line, should not either.
