Note that `git-annex add` does preserve the timestamp of the file
while adding it to the annex. Much the same as a file's timestamp is
the same after `git add` as it was before running that command.
When `git-annex add` replaces a file with a symlink, it even makes the
symlink's timestamp be the same as the original file.

What git-annex does not do is try to store the timestamp in git and arrange
for clones that receive the file to get the same timestamp. There are lots
of things like this that someone *might* want git to preserve, but git
doesn't, and it's out of scope for git-annex to try to work around git's
limitations in these areas. Plenty of room for other tools that add
git tracked timestamps, etc. Many such tools exist.
