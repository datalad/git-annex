The borg special remote allows git-annex to treat borg backups of a
git-annex repository as just another remote. This could also be done for
other backup software.

restic seems like a good candidate. What other commonly used backup
software might be good to support? Comments welcome with suggestions..

Currently, support for these has to be in git-annex, it cannot be an
external special remote. Just providing a way to in the external special
remote interfase to set `thirdPartyPopulated` might be enough to allow
using external special remotes for this. 

The borg implementation does have getImported which looks at the git-annex
branch, and is used in an optimisation. It would be good to factor that out
to a common optimisation for all `thirdPartyPopulated` remotes. --[[Joey]]
