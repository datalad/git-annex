Even if it only re-checks when git-annex is going to use the remote
(and not on every run of git-annex) that seems perhaps too often to check.

But if it checks less often than that, once per day or whatever, there will
of course be a window where it has not yet noticed the change and uses the
cached remote.name.annexUrl and potentially fails.

A balance might be that if it fails to connect to the remote.name.annexUrl,
it could re-check it then.
