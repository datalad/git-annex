For a long time (since 2019) git-annex has been progressively converting from
FilePath to RawFilePath. And more recently, to OsPath.

[[!meta title="OsPath conversion"]]

The reason is mostly performance, also a simpler representation of
filepaths that doesn't need encoding hacks to support non-UTF8 values.

Some commands like `git-annex find` have been converted end-to-end
with good performance results. And OsPath is used very widly now. 
But this conversion is not yet complete. This is a todo to keep track
of the status.

* The OsPath build flag makes git-annex build with OsPath. Otherwise,
  it builds with RawFilePath. That build flag is now on by default,
  and there is a build warning when it is not set.

* The plan is to eventually remove the build flag and simplify code in
  git-annex to not need to support two different build methods.

* unix has modules that operate on RawFilePath but no OSPath versions yet.
  See https://github.com/haskell/unix/issues/240
  However, this is not really a performance problem, because converting
  from an OsPath to a RawFilePath in order to use such a function
  is the same amount of work as calling a native OsPath version of the
  function would be, because passing a ShortByteString into the FFI entails
  making a copy of it.

* filepath-bytestring is used when not building with OsPath. It's also
  in Setup-Depends. In order to stop needing to maintain that library,
  the goal is to eliminate it from dependencies. This may need to wait
  until the OsPath build flag is removed and OsPath is always used.

* Git.LsFiles has several `pipeNullSplit'` calls that have toOsPath
  mapped over the results. That adds an additional copy, so the lazy
  ByteString is converted to strict,
  and then to ShortByteString, with a copy each time. This is in the
  critical path for large git repos, and might be a noticable slowdown.
  There is currently no easy way to go direct from a lazy ByteString to a
  ShortByteString, although it would certianly be possible to write low
  level code to do it efficiently. Alternatively, it would be possible to
  read a strict ByteString direct from a handle, like hGetLine does
  (although in this case it would need to stop at the terminating 0 byte)
  and unsafePerformIO to stream to a list would avoid needing to rewrite
  this code to not use a list.

* OsPath has by now been pushed about as far as it will go, but here and
  there use of FilePath remains in odd corners. These are unlikely to cause
  any noticiable performance impact.

The `require_OsPath` branch removes the OsPath build flag,
and merging it would resolve this. That will need packagers to do some work
to package the libraries though. Or to upgrade ghc, since file-io and
os-string are boot libraries since ghc 9.12.2 and 9.10.1 respectively.
