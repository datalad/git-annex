For a long time (since 2019) git-annex has been progressively converting from
FilePath to RawFilePath (aka ByteString).

The reason is mostly performance, also a simpler representation of
filepaths that doesn't need encoding hacks to support non-UTF8 values.

Some commands like `git-annex find` use RawFilePath end-to-end. 
But this conversion is not yet complete. This is a todo to keep track of the
status.

* unix has modules that operate on RawFilePath but no OSPath versions yet.
  See https://github.com/haskell/unix/issues/240
* filepath-1.4.100 implements support for OSPath. It is bundled with
  ghc-9.6.1 and above. Will need to switch from filepath-bytestring to
  this, and to avoid a lot of ifdefs, probably only after git-annex no
  longers supports building with older ghc versions.
* Utility.FileIO is used for most withFile and openFile, but not yet for
  readFile, writeFile, and appendFile. Including versions of those from
  bytestring.
* readFileStrict should be replaced with Utility.FileIO.readFile'

----

The following patch can be useful to find points where conversions are
done. Especially useful to identify cases where a value is converted
`FilePath -> RawFilePath -> FilePath`.
