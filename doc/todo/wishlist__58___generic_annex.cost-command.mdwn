### Current setup

ATM git-annex has

remote.<name>.annex-cost
remote.<name>.annex-cost-command  # command is not provided cmdline options by annex

to set the cost for a given remote.  That requires setting up one of those variables per each host, and possibly hardcoding options for the annex-cost-command providing e.g. the remote name.

### Suggestion

wouldn't it be more general and thus more flexible to have a repository-wide

annex.cost-command

which could take options %remote, %file and assessed accordingly per each file upon '--get' request to allow maximal flexibility: e.g. some files might better be fetched from remotes supporting transfer compression, some from the web, etc.  Also it might be worth providing %remote_kind ("special" vs "git") to disambiguate %remote's?
