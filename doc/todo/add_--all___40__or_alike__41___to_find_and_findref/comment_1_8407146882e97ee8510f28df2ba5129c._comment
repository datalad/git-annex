Using --copies necessarily loads up the location tracking log for
each file, which does add overhead.

Any other matching option that matches everything will work just as well
for you. I think that `git-annex find --include='*'` is the best thing
currently available. Indeed, the git-annex-find man page suggests to use
that. The only overhead is an unncessary glob match, which
should be almost unmeasurable.

It does seem like it might be worth adding --anything that simply matches
anything. Preferred content expressions already support "anything". And
`git-annex find --anything` makes sense and is easier to type.

But, you'll probably be better off using `--include='*'` since it works
with older versions of git-annex.

(--all is the wrong name for such an option since it already has another
meaning, although I don't think it makes sense for `git-annex find` to
support --all, it has certianly been requested before by people who want to
generalize that existing meaning..)
