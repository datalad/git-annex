You have a bare git repository on your USB stick. The assistant uses bare repositories on USB sticks currently, although recent changes to support FAT make it possible to use non-bare repositories.

For this to really work the way you want it to, the assistant would need to start updating local non-bare repositories whenever it pushed changes to them. Currently the assistant only updates the repository it's running in, so a non-bare repository on USB would lag behind and show an old version of the directory until manually updated with `git annex sync`.
