@Joey:
As my use case is 1 person using multiple machines, I didn't think local/XMPP pairing was appropriate.

Local pairing because the netbook leaves the network the desktop machine is on, which is when transferring the files is wanted (otherwise, they would just use the desktop...).
XMPP pairing description implies that it is for 2 different people (thus 2 different addresses). Can it be used where both annexes are using the same address? Or does the address also allow you to include the location (i.e. name@host.com/netbook)?

It definitely sounds like I am misunderstanding how this is supposed to work so I apologise for that. Please keep up the excellent work. git-annex is one of those tools I wish I had learned about a long time ago!

@edheil: Interesting workaround, thanks.
