Xyem, if you use git to clone a repo, instead of letting the assistant do it for you, you can get a non-bare repo.  See the walkthrough for some examples.  You can keep its working tree up to date with \"git annex sync\" run in that directory.

Only helpful if you don't mind using git annex at the command line, I know.
