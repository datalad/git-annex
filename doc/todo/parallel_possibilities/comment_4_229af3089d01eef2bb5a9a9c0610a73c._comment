Now, many git-annex commands support -Jn, the output is not a jumbled mess
thanks to the concurrent-output library.

At this point all I see that needs doing is:

* Maybe support -Jn in more commands. Just needs changing a few lines of
  code and testing each.

* It would be nice to be able to run cleanup actions in the "background",
  after a command has otherwise succeeded, even when -Jn is not used.
  In particular, when getting files, their checksum is verified after
  download. That would nicely parellize with the next file being
  downloaded.

  This could be implemented also using concurrent-output, but it would then
  have to drive the display even when -J is not used. I'm not yet sure
  enough about it to use it by default.
