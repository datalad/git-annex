annex.stalldetection lets remotes be configured with a minimum throughput
to detect and retry stalls. But most users are not going to configure this. 
Could something be done to dynamically detect a stall, without configuration?

Eg, wait until data starts to flow, and then check if there's at least some
data being sent each half minute. If so, the progress display is being updated
at least every minute. So then if 1 minute goes by without more data
flowing, it's almost certainly stalled. And if the progress display is
updated less frequently, see if it's updated every 2 minutes, etc. Although
realistically, progress displays are updated every chunk, and there's
typically more than 1 chunk per minute. So longer durations than 1 minute
may be an unncessary complication. And a minute to detect a stall is fine.

> Implemented this, annex.stalldetection = true enables automatic.

It may still need a config to turn it on, because running
transfers in separate processes can lead to more resource use, or even
password prompting, which could be annoying to existing users. Also, if it
gets it wrong and the remote does not support resuming transfers,
defaulting to on could lead to bad waste of resources. It could
detect stalls even when not turned on, but only display a message
suggesting enabling the config. --[[Joey]]
