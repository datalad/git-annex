Of course, choosing a backend that does not include extension is something
worth considering. Unless something needs the object file to preserve the
extension. For a .mkv file, I'd guess most video players don't care about
the extension.

annex.maxextensionlength won't help here, but I think it makes sense to add
an analagous annex.maxextensioncount which would default to 2 (as it
currently does to handle .tar.gz) but you could set to 1.

It might also be a reasonable argument that filename extensions are not
just numbers, but then again, foo.1.pdf foo.2.pdf is a pretty common kind
of pattern, although the extent that the numbers in that are extensions
with any meaning to a program would depend. Some archivers do eg split
files into foo.1 foo.2 foo.3 and use the extensions to get them back.
Anyway, the same kind of problem could happen when not using only
numbers.
