I suppose one enhancement could be to ignore annex.diskreserve when content is obtained by reflink copy, but I can imagine this would be difficult to achieve, since we don't know in advance whether or not --reflink=auto will actually result in a reflink copy. I imagine you could try reflink=always first, ignoring annex.diskreserve, then if it fails, fallback to reflink=auto where annex.diskreserve is checked, but perhaps this is too much filesystem-specific logic to be appropriate in git-annex.
