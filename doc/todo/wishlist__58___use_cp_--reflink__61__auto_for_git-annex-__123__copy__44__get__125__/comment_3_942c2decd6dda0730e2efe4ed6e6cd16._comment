Yes, reflink is used instead of rsync when it's able to determine it's the
same filesystem.

Not checking diskreserve for reflink (and also for hard link when
annex.hardlink is set) would be nice. But, it's a layering problem
since currently the diskreserve check is done separately from the transfer.

The same layering problem also makes downloads from encrypted special
remotes not check if there's space for both the encrypted and de-encrypted
file content, in cases where both files are present on disk at the same
time.

So, there would be multiple benefits to improving the api somehow so more
smart diskreserve checks can be done. Although I'd then worry that if
remotes were responsible for doing diskreserve checks, they might be buggy
and forget to check.
