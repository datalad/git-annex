git's core.SharedRepository is supported by git-annex, but only
with the group/all/world/everybody settings. core.SharedRepository=0644
etc is not supported.

There's no insormountable reason why not, Joey just hates umask mode math
stuff and nobody has sent a patch. Note that Annex.Content.freezeContent
should remove the write bit from files, no matter what.
