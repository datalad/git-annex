I think perhaps the notify options should be revamped as I don't get what their purpose is.

Receiving one desktop notification for each and every transfer sounds like insanity to me. I'd get constant notifications doing anything at all.

To me, notifications are for things that require immediate attention. An email for example or an assistant fsck that found corrupted files or perhaps a failed git-annex transfer. That sort of thing.  
What's the use-case of constantly requiring immediate attention the entire time for every benign thing happening? In my mind, I might as well just watch the git-annex progress log at that point.

Before reading what the options actually did, I would have expected `--notify-finish` to produce exactly one notification when the git-annex command I set off is done. Perhaps with a summary in it what it had done (successes/errors).
