I'd consider a single 'persistent' notification for git-annex sufficient. When a transfer starts/finishes the notification is updated. Maybe show a configurable amount of last items (`git config annex.notification-max-items` with a default of 5 or so). `-J` Worker threads would just add to that notification, I don't see a need for one notification per worker thread (that can easily go up to another 16 with `--jobs=cpus` on modern CPUs, filling the screen again ðŸ™ƒ).
