If you only want a notification at the end of the command,
you can use: `git-annex whatever; notify-send done`

So there is more value in git-annex notifying after each transfer than at
the end of the command. Just because it would not be valuable in your
particular case doesn't mean it's a useless feature. It's not unusual to
have files large enough that transferring them takes some time.
