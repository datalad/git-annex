Whoops! You'd only told me O(N) twice before..

So this is not too high priority. I think I would like to get the per-remote storage sorted out anyway, since probably it will be the thing needed to convert the URL backend into a special remote, which would then allow ripping out the otherwise unused pluggable backend infrastructure.

Update: Per-remote storage is now sorted out, so this could be implemented
if it actually made sense to do so.
