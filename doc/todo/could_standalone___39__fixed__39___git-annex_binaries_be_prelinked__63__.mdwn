Since in datalad we are invoking git and git-annex quite frequently, and on debian systems atm relying on git-annex-standalone pkg, I wondered, if there is a possibility to get all 'shimmed' binaries prelinked against shipped core libs to avoid a current bunch of unsucesfull searches for libraries.... I thought it might provide a notable benefit.

just an idea
