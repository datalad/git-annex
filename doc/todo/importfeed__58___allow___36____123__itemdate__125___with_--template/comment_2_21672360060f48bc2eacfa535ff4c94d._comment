getItemPublishDate returns a String, which can contain any of several date formats. Deferred until the feed library has something more sane.
Upstream bug: <https://github.com/sof/feed/issues/6>

As for how to format the date in the feed, I would be ok with having itemdate (YYYYMMDD), itemyear (YYYY), itemmonth (MM) and itemday (DD). Full date formatting seems like overkill here.
