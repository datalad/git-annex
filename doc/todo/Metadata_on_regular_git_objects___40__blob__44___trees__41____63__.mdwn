Is it technically possible for the metadata interface to also support regular git objects, so that committed files or directories were also subject to tagging? For most metadata-related intents and purposes it seems I’d like to treat annexed and regular files alike; so I’d like to tag the LaTeX/ReST/etc. source for a presentation the same way I treat the output PDF, only that the former are likely not annexed. In the design docs it says metadata is attached to annex keys. Could it equally be attached to git blobs and trees, or would that break horribly somewhere?
