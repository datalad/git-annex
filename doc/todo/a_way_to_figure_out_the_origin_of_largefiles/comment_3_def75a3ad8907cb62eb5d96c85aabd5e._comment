Hmm, --show-origin only implements part of what was requested here. The
other part is to explain what part of a largefiles expression caused it to
match (or not match).

I think that nobodyinperson's suggestion of --explain got into my brain
and marinated a while, because I later opened [[todo/option_to_explain]].
