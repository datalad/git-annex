This is good spotting of a git configuration that git-annex does not support.

However, I doubt that even if I made it use `GIT_SSH`, it would be useful. git-annex uses several features that are probably unique to openssh, including connection caching. While you could disable annex.sshcaching and perhaps get a different ssh to work, it would be much slower.
