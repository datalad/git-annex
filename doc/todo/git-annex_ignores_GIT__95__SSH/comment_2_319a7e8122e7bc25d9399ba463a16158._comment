Hi Joey,

Thanks for your answer. In my opinion, this would be an important requirement for various reasons:

1.) It is very confusing and results in unpredictable errors. I spent days in finding out what caused all the weird stuff that happened. Even if it is not supported, an error message or at least warning should be issued.

2.) At least in Windows, plink.exe is the quasi-standard SSH client. All SW I am aware of supports at least plink.exe as alternative to openssh (SVN, git, unison, ...). Even within cygwin I often use plink for X11 forwarding etc. If features like SSH caching do not work with that it's totally fine.

3.) Even for a unix environment, it is critical to be able to use a wrapper (or at least to configure SSH parameters). In my opinion, this should and must work consistently (git, git-annex and rsync). For example what if I have a dedicated public key for a repository and to not want to use %HOME%\.ssh\id_rsa ?
For unison, I use a wrapper my_ssh.cmd which wraps specialized parameters (in particular SSH key, port) with plink.exe to ssh.exe's interface. Similarly, I might be interested in disabling agent functionality and use GSSAPI etc. etc.

A little bit OT now: I already wondered if and how inefficient git-annex is in this regard. For example, if I sync content, it seems that ssh opens a new connection for each file! (at least each file results in a signing request in my agent). This happens even if I use ssh.exe. Is there anything wrong?

Thanks
