The walkthrough has enough to get a user started in the right direction
in <https://git-annex.branchable.com/walkthrough/#index12h2>.

I don't know if <https://git-annex.branchable.com/special_remotes> is a
good entry point for a user to learn the basics of what they are. It's
mostly a list, and I doubt most readers make it past the list.

I have expanded it to mention the main commands.
