I've checked and the haskell aws library does not currently support this.
Since the library currently needs a maintainer, I have not filed an issue
to implement this.

It might be possible to work around it, by using s3SignQuery with a dummy
credentials, and then modifying the SignedQuery that it returns to remove
the authentication headers. Or by bypassing s3SignQuery and constructing
a SignedQuery that is not actually signed. Update: No, it's not possible,
because s3SignQuery is used internally in aws.

Do you have a sample bucket that does allow anonymous access, not only
to individual files, but to listing the content of the bucket?
