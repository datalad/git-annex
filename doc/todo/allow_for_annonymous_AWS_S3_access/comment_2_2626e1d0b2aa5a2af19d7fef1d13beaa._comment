> Do you have a sample bucket that does allow anonymous access, not only to individual files, but to listing the content of the bucket?

doesn't that `dandiarchive` allows for listing?  if not, also try `fcp-indi`. Also, if looking for a small one, checkout our test one `datalad-test0-versioned` - I think it is fully public.  At least for fcp-indi and datalad-test0-versioned query like `curl -v https://s3.amazonaws.com/fcp-indi/` works and seems to list it
