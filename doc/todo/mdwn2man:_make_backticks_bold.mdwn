The traditionnal way of marking commandline flags in a manpage is with a `.B` (for Bold, I guess). It doesn't seem to be used by mdwn2man, which makes the manpage look a little more dull than it could.

The following patch makes those options come out more obviously:

[[!format diff """
diff --git a/Build/mdwn2man b/Build/mdwn2man
index ba5919b..7f819ad 100755

        s/\`//g;
        s/^\s*\./\\&./g;
        if (/^#\s/) {

I tested it against the git-annex manpage and it seems to work well. --[[anarcat]]
