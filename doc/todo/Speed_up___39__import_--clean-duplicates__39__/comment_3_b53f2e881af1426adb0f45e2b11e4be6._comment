`git-annex import --from remote` has recently been sped up a lot,
and the plan is to [[todo/remove_legacy_import_directory_interface]]
in favor of it or reimplement the lecacy interface on top of it.

Using `git-annex import --from remote --fast`, when there's a huge file in
the directory remote, will hash it, but only once. On subsequent runs it
will recognise the file it has seen before.

So all that's needed to emulate --clean-duplicates is a way to do this:

	git-annex move --from remote --copies 2

Which doesn't work currently, but see [[drop_from_export_remote]].
