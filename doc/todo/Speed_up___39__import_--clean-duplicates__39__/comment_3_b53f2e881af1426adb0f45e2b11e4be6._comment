`git-annex import --from remote` has recently been sped up a lot,
and the plan is to [[todo/remove_legacy_import_directory_interface]]
in favor of it.

I think this would work as a faster alternative to --clean-duplicates,
using a directory special remote:

	git-annex import --from remote --fast
	git-annex move --from remote --copies 2

When there's a huge file in the directory remote, it will hash it, but only
once. On subsequent runs it will recognise the file it has seen before.
