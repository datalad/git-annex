Could be tested out with an additional flag `--with-size-bloom` on import?

It would then build a bloom (and use a cached one with --fast) and do the usual import.

So I could do this:

    # Bloom is created and the import is done using it
    git annex import --clean-duplicates --with-size-bloom $TARGET

    # Previously created bloom is used
    git annex import --clean-duplicates --with-size-bloom --fast $TARGET2
    git annex import --clean-duplicates --with-size-bloom --fast $TARGET3

I can implement this behaviour in Perl with Bloom::Filter and let you know how it performs if that would be useful to you..?
