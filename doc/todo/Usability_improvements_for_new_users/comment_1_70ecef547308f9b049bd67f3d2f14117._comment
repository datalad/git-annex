> `git annex info` has no equivalent `git info`

git-annex can't be limited to commands that happen to have equivilant git
commands. `git annex drop` also has no equivilant in git, but is
fundamental to git-annex.

If you're thinking of `git annex info` as equivilant to `git remote` in 
listing remotes, that does not consider everything the info command does.

> git annex remote should ideally return a list of remotes for parallelism

`git remote` lists all remotes including git-annex special remotes,
so `git annex remote` would be unnecessary duplication.

> git annex renameremote -> git annex remote rename

This would encourage drawing a false equivilance with `git remote rename`.

I'm also not convinced that stacking subcommands 3 levels deep is a good
idea. The user has to dig through every level to find something then.

There's also an intentional similarity in naming between `git annex init`
and `git annex initremote`, which I think makes sense and helps users
learn and remember the latter command after having first learned the former. 
And `enableremote` and `renameremote` then flow naturally from that.
This is, IMHO, a more natural learning flow than searching for strained
equivilances to `git remote` commands.

I do think that `git annex add` has a very good reason to parallel `git
add`, and if there are other git-annnex commands that could directly
parallel a git command like that and don't, that would be worth addressing.
