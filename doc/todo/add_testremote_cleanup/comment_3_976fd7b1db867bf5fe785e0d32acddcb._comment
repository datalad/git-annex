>Like the man page for this command says, it's best to make a new remote for testing purposes, not use a production one.

My fault for not re-reading the webpage.

There's some value, I think, in being able to test production remotes.  There's always a chance that a test remote got configured differently than a production one, so there's more confidence from having tested the production remote.

If [find/prefer keys by file extension in key](https://git-annex.branchable.com/todo/find__47__prefer_keys_by_file_extension_in_key/) could be implemented, one could delete keys matching `*.this-is-a-test-key`.
