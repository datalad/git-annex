Like the man page for this command says, it's best to make a new remote for
testing purposes, not use a production one.

I think that a simple improvement to it would be for it to generate the
same test keys every time. Then if it failed once or was interrupted or
the remote was buggy, once that got fixed the same command could be run
again, and would clean up the test keys that were earlier stored on the
remote.

It's generating random data and a key from that,
but a predictable random data would not impair the test really.
Although testExportTree currently starts with a test that might fail
if the key is already present in the remote.
