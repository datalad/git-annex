When fsck'ing a remote repo, files seem to be copied from the remote to a local dir (thus written to disk), read back again for checksumming and then deleted.

This is very time-inefficient and wastes precious SSD erase cycles which is especially problematic in the case of special remotes because they can only be fsck'd "remotely" (AFAIK).

Instead, remote files should be directly piped into an in-memory checksum function and never written to disk on the machine performing the fsck.
