`git annex status .` or otherwise running it with a directory has recently started walking all the location logs for all files in the directory in order to display variance from configured numcopies. It would be easy to add a redundancy counter to that.

It would slow down the global status when not passed a directory to add redundancy info there. Maybe local is enough?
