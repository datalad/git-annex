This happens on upgrade from a v5 repository, which calls 
configureSmudgeFilter. [[!commit 401a79675ba2f125545ec9ec77376cb4b965fa4a]]
explains why it needs to run status there.

So, it will indeed be ok to pass --ignore-submodules, since each submodule
that is a git-annex repository will get upgraded in its own time, 
and will run configureSmudgeFilter then.
