This is now implemented, use p2phttp --directory to serve all repositories
in that directory.

There is one known problem, which I'm leaving this todo open for. When a
repository is moved out of the directory, the server should stop serving
it. And it does, eg both git-annex get and git-annex drop will fail, since
the server is not able to access the directory any longer. But, a second
git-annex drop actually hangs at the "locking origin" stage. 
(When run with -J2.. with more jobs it takes more than 2) 

It seems that the server is leaking annex workers in this case. Probably
it fails to recover from a crash.

Luckily, it only affects serving the uuid of the removed repository, other
repositories in the directory will continue to be served without problems
when this happens.
