the [[git-annex]] manpage is still pretty long. i wonder if work shouldn't be done to shorten it further.

what i'm thinking of is that this entry, for example, takes up three lines where it could take two, reducing the size by 30% since most commands have only one line explaining it:

<pre>
 * undo `[filename|directory] ...`

   Undo last change to a file or directory.

   See [[git-annex-undo]](1) for details.
</pre>

the `git(1)` manpage resolves this by putting the reference in the first line:

<pre>
       git-init(1)
           Create an empty Git repository or reinitialize an existing one.
</pre>

So i would think there are two options here:

1. do like git, but preserving the usage:

<pre>
 * [[git-annex-undo]](1) `[filename|directory]`

   Undo last change to a file or directory.
</pre>

2. Put the reference on the same line:

<pre>
 * undo `[filename|directory] ...`

   Undo last change to a file or directory. See [[git-annex-undo]](1) for details.
</pre>

Opinions? --[[anarcat]]
