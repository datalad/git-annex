Most of this can be done with either `git-annex adjust --hide-missing` or views. 

The only thing that cannot is limiting files to those matching a glob,
though views can limit files to the contents of directories.

Unfortunately, adjusted branches and views don't compose. There is a todo
about that, [[todo/unify_adjust_with_view]]. I think that is what you're
looking for, or very close.
