It's now possible to `git-annex import --no-content --from
a-directory-special-remote`. So then you have the files sitting on the
external drive and not filling up the git repository.

And `git-annex copy --from foo --to bar` is also supported, so you can
use that to send the files over the S3 or wherever.

So, I think this todo can be closed.
