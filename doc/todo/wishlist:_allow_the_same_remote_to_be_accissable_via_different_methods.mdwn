This is a wishlist item:

Please allow the same remote to be available via different remotes. So in my LAN my remote is available using a ssh-connection, and when I travel with my laptop, the git-annex can also reach this remote using the Jabber transport.

> [[done]]; this has always been fully supported. --[[Joey]]
