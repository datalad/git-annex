Honestly, your message somewhat triggered my internal spam filters. In
particular, its linking to multiple proprietary services adjacent to
glowing language about them. Also the very
similar language and linking in your post at
<https://github.com/named-data-mobile/ndn-photo-app/issues/186>.

For this reason, I have removed some hyperlinks from your post.
While I think, on review, that you are acting in good faith,
I also think it's important you understand a post like this can
cause that kind of reaction these days. And removing the links
will thus help no matter what.

---

There is actually an open todo at [[todo/generic_p2p_socket_transport]]
which I think could probably be used to implement what you are envisioning.

So my suggestion is you review that proposed design and see if it would
support the use cases you are envisioning. And if not, what changes would
need to be made.
