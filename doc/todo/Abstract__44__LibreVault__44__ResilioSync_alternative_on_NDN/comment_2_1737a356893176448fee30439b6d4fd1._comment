I see, I tend to cite as much as possible, and only reference proprietary software because sadly there is plenty that has no similar libre option. I have removed the resiliosync link as well because its name is unique enough to look up, but left the Abstract reference as you put it since it is a generic name that may be hard to find otherwise.

Thanks for the link // deduplicationâ€”will use that ticket now
