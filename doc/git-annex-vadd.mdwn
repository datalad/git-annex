# NAME

git-annex vadd - add subdirs to current view

# SYNOPSIS

git annex vadd `[field=glob ...] [field=value ...] [tag ...]`

# DESCRIPTION

Changes the current view, adding an additional level of directories
to categorize the files.

For example, when the view is by author/tag, `vadd year=*` will
change it to year/author/tag.

So will `vadd year=2014 year=2013`, but limiting the years in view
to only those two.
