# NAME

git-annex numcopies - configure desired number of copies

# SYNOPSIS

git annex numcopies `N`

# DESCRIPTION

Tells git-annex how many copies it should preserve of files, over all
repositories. The default is 1. 

Run without a number to get the current value.

This configuration is stored in the git-annex branch, so it will be seen
by all clones of the repository. It can be overridden on a per-file basis
by the annex.numcopies setting in .gitattributes files, or can be
overridden temporarily with the --numcopies option.

When git-annex is asked to drop a file, it first verifies that the
number of copies can be satisfied among all the other
repositories that have a copy of the file.

In unusual situations, involving special remotes that do not support
locking, and concurrent drops of the same content from multiple
repositories, git-annex may violate the numcopies setting. It still
guarantees at least 1 copy is preserved. This can be configured by
using [[git-annex-mincopies]](1)

# OPTIONS
