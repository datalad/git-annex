Suppose I have two Samba fileservers in two different locations. Can I use git-annex in thin mode + git-annex assistant to automatically synchronize these two fileserver? Specifically, I am trying to understand if:

1) git-annex preserve owner/group ID and POSIX ACLs;
2) it can efficiently manage very large number of file/directory (500K+ files)
3) it can be used alongside inotify to efficiently transfer only changed files

One last thing: I which sense git-annex is not like Unison? It seems it can be configured to have very similar functionality. I am missing something?

Thank you all.
