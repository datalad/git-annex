or to make it more simple ;)

sparkleshare is for proejects and maybe backup your documents folder

annex is for managing big binary files that not get modified most of the time and only added/synced or deleted.

hope thats on the point, try to start using it also now, but am a bit blowen away what it all can do and what not... and how to get a good use case, and mixing media-management with backup of home and thinking on solving that all with annex without having it used ever ;)
