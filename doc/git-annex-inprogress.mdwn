# NAME

git-annex inprogress - access files while they're being downloaded

# SYNOPSIS

git annex inprogress `[path ...]`

# DESCRIPTION

This command allows accessing the content of an annexed file while
it is still being downloaded. It outputs to standard output the
name of the temporary file that is being used to download the specified
annexed file.

This can sometimes be used to stream a file before it's been fully
downloaded, for example:

	git annex get video.mpeg &
	vlc $(git annex inprogress video.mpeg)

Of course if the file is downloading too slowly, the media player will
reach the end too soon and not show the whole thing. And of course, only
some file formats can be usefully streamed in this way.

# OPTIONS

* file matching options
 
  The [[git-annex-matching-options]](1)
  can be used to specify files to access.

* `--all`

  Rather than specifying a filename or path, this option can be
  used to access all files that are currently being downloaded.

# EXIT STATUS

If any of the requested files are not currently being downloaded,
the exit status will be 1.
