Are there any limitations on which characters are allowed in an URL, and on how long an URL can be? I am working on a special remote which kind of abuses this feature by saving information about how to get the file in the URL with a specific scheme. For now it seems like I can use URLs of the form `scheme:<arbitrary json>`, but I am not sure if this might become an issue later. I could also encode the data with base64 or something similar, in which case size limitations would still be relevant; if there are any. Although, the json variant has the added benefit of being much more easily readable in whereis output.
