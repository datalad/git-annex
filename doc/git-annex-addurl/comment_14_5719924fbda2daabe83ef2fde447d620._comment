@matthias.risze length is not an issue. You should avoid characters that
are not usually in urls, particularly whitespace and newline.

It seems to me though that your special remote would perhaps
be better served by using the SETSTATE and GETSTATE commands
(see [[design/external_special_remote_protocol]])
