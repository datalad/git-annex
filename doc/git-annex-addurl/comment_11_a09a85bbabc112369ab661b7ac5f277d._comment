If you add a file to your repo first via `addurl --fast`, it writes the filename as a symlink to a file that incorporates the URL, rather than the file hash. This is expected, since git-annex can't know the file hash until it's actually downloaded the file.

If you then `git annex get` that file, it downloads the file to the path that uses the URL. Is the hash ever recorded for these files? If you were to drop and re-download the file, would git-annex accept a different file?
