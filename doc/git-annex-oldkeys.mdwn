# NAME

git-annex oldkeys - list keys used for old versions of files

# SYNOPSIS

git annex oldkeys `[path ...]`

# DESCRIPTION

Lists keys used for old versions of the specified files or directories.

The output from this command can be piped into a command like
`git-annex drop --batch-keys`

The keys are listed in order from newest to oldest.

When listing old keys for a directory, it will include keys used by deleted
files that were in that directory in past commits.

# OPTIONS

* --unchecked

  By default this command does not list a key that is also used by any
  file in the currently checked out branch. This option makes it also
  list such keys.

  The default behavior avoids surprises when dropping listed keys.
  This option can be useful when eg copying all old versions of a file to a
  remote.

* --revision-range=value

  Only list old keys used in the specified range of revisions.
  This works the same as the revision range option of `git log`.
  See gitrevisions(7) for documentation about the format of this option.

  For example, to list only keys used since the tag v1.0, use
  `--revision-range=v1.0..HEAD`

* Also the [[git-annex-common-options]](1) can be used.
