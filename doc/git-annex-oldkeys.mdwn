# NAME

git-annex oldkeys - list keys used for old versions of files

# SYNOPSIS

git annex oldkeys `[path ...]`

# DESCRIPTION

Lists keys used for old versions of the specified files or directories.

The output from this command can be piped into a command like
`git-annex drop --batch-keys`

The keys are listed in order from newest to oldest.

When listing old keys for a directory, it will include the most recent
key used by deleted files (but not by renamed files).

Note that the listed keys may still be used by other files in the
repository.

# OPTIONS

* --revision-range=value

  Only list old keys used in the specified range of revisions.
  This works the same as the revision range option of `git log`.
  See gitrevisions(7) for documentation about the format of this option.

  For example, to list only keys used since the tag v1.0, use
  `--revision-range=v1.0..HEAD`

* Also the [[git-annex-common-options]](1) can be used.
