Hey!

Is there any way to `git annex get` a file in a specific branch when I have a bare repository?

Since `git show <branch name>:<path in branch>` works I tried that notation in `get`, but that is not recognized.

It is also not possible to combine `--branch` with a path as far as I can tell.

My next idea was to figure out the key of the file first and then get that, but `git annex lookupkey` does not work in a bare repository either.

I could parse the key from the output of `git show`, but then I would need to deal with git-annex internals like if it is a symlink or a pointer file, which feels a bit wrong.
But since that would be possible I don't see a reason why e.g. lookupkey does not work. Is there any way to achieve this?
