> Note that, like git-annex unregisterurl, using this option unregisters an url from a special remote, but it does not mark the content as not present in that special remote.

But then how to mark \"not present\" in that remote?  After `git-annex-reregisterurl` I still have `[datalad]` remote listed although url now, correctly, associated with `web`. I have tried  `drop` but that didn't work

```shell
‚ùØ git annex drop --from datalad images/neurodesk/neurodesk-afni--21.2.00.simg
drop images/neurodesk/neurodesk-afni--21.2.00.simg (from datalad...) (locking smaug...) 
  Removal of content from urls is not possible
failed
drop: 1 failed
```

Could there may be option `--fully` or `--mark-not-present` option to make it 1 invocation operation?
