You can use `git-annex setpresentkey` to tell git-annex that content is not
present in your special remote.

Usually whether or not an url is currently registered with a special remote
does not affect whether content is actually stored in it, which is why
these are 2 different things. Except for the web special remote, which is a
special case. I guess yours special remote also may be a special case, but
git-annex doesn't know about it, and so why not use setpresentkey to handle
the special case, rather than further complicating reregisterurl with it?
