Thank you Joey!

or in the other words, \"not that special\" after all.  I see it just a common enough pattern for use of this new `reregisterurl` that in my case it would be easier to just add an option instead of chaining manually `reregisterurl`, figure out what key one way or another, call `setpresentkey` with `0`.  After all it is for a user to announce one way or another.

Anyways, I am ok for now, hopefully would not forget next time I use it to chase with that extra invocation.
