@Matthias, here is an example of git-annex merge updating the master branch from the synced/master branch that was pushed to it earlier:

<pre>
joey@darkstar:~/tmp/test/2>git annex merge
merge git-annex (merging synced/git-annex into git-annex...)
ok
merge synced/master 
Updating 7942eee..1f3422e
Fast-forward
 new_file | 1 +
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
 create mode 120000 new_file
ok
</pre>

If you are having trouble with it somehow, I'd suggest filing a bug report.
