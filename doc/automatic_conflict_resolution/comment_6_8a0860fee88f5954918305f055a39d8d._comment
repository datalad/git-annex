@joeyh: This must be a misunderstanding of what I want. I use version 5.20140320. I can't find a workflow where \"git annex merge\" changes my master branch, it only updates the git-annex branch.

Thinking again of it after some time, I am basically fine with \"git annex sync\". The only thing I am uncomfortable with is that the automatic merge is pushed without review.
