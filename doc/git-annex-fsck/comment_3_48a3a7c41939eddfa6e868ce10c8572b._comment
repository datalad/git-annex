importtree=yes remotes are always untrusted. The reason is that
something else is assumed to be writing to those remotes, which is what
populates them with files. And that could delete or change any file at any
time. So if git-annex didn't untrust the remote, and relied on it to hold
the only copy of a file, such a change would cause data loss.

There would need to be a new config setting to add the concept of
guaranteed readonly importtree=yes remotes.

git-annex does not allow --numcopies to be set to 0 as that can cause data
loss.
