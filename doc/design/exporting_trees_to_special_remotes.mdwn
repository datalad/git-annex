For publishing content from a git-annex repository, it would be useful to
be able to export a tree of files to a special remote, using the filenames
and content from the tree.

## configuring a special remote for tree export

If a special remote already has files stored in it, switching it to be a
tree export would result in a mix of files named by key and by filename.
That's not desirable. So, the user should set up a new special remote
when they want to export a tree. (It would also be possible to drop all content
from an existing special remote and reuse it, but there does not seem much
benefit in doing so.)

Add a new `initremote` configuration `exporttree=true`, that cannot be
changed by `enableremote`:

	git annex initremote myexport type=... exporttree=true

It does not make sense to encrypt an export, so exporttree=true requires
(and can even imply) encryption=false.

Note that the particular tree to export is not specified yet. This is
because the tree that is exported to a special remote may change.

## exporting a treeish

To export a treeish, the user can run:

	git annex export $treeish --to myexport

That does all necessary uploads etc to make the special remote contain
the tree of files. The treeish can be a tag, a branch, or a tree.

Users may sometimes want to export multiple treeishes to a single special 
remote. For example, exporting several tags. This interface could be
complicated to support that, putting the treeishes in subdirectories on the
special remote etc. But that's not necessary, because the user can use git
commands to graft trees together into a larger tree, and export that larger
tree.

If an export is interrupted, running it again should resume where it left
off.

It would also be nice to have a way to say, "I want to export the master branch", 
and have git-annex sync and the assistant automatically update the export.
This could be done by recording the treeish in eg, refs/remotes/myexport/HEAD.
git-annex export could do this by default (if the user doesn't want the export
to track the branch, they could instead export a tree or a tag).

## updating an export

The user can at any time re-run git-annex export with a new treeish
to change what's exported. While some use cases for git annex export
involve publishing datasets that are intended to remain immutable,
other use cases include eg, making a tree of files available to a computer
that can't run git-annex, and in such use cases, the tree needs to be able
to be updated.

To efficiently update an export, git-annex can diff the tree
that was exported with the new tree. The naive approach is to upload
new and modified files and remove deleted files.

Note that a file may have been partially uploaded to an export, and then
the export updated to a tree without that file. So, need to try to delete
all removed files, even if location tracking does not say that the special
remote contains them.

With rename detection, if the special remote supports moving files,
more efficient updates can be done. It gets complicated; consider two files
that swap names.

If the special remote supports copying files, that would also make some
updates more efficient.

## resuming exports

Resuming an interrupted export needs to work well.

There are two cases here:

1. Some of the files in the tree have been uploaded; others have not.
2. A file has been partially uploaded.

These two cases need to be disentangled somehow in order to handle
them. One way is to use the location log as follows:

* Before a file is uploaded, look up what key is currently exported
  using that filename. If there is one, update the location log,
  saying it's not present in the special remote.
* Upload the file.
* Update the location log for the newly exported key.

Note that this method does not allow resuming a partial upload by appending to
a file, because we don't know if the file actually started to be uploaded, or
if the file instead still has the old key's content. Instead, the whole
file needs to be re-uploaded.

Alternative: Keep an index file that's the current state of the export.
See comment #4 of [[todo/export]]. Not sure if that works? Perhaps it
would be overkill if it's only used to support resuming partial uploads.

## changes to special remote interface

This needs some additional methods added to special remotes, and to
the [[external_special_remote_protocol]].

* `TRANSFEREXPORT STORE|RETRIEVE Key File Name`  
  Requests the transfer of a File on local disk to or from a given
  Name on the special remote.  
  The Name will be in the form of a relative path, and may contain
  path separators, whitespace, and other special characters.  
  The Key is provided in case the special remote wants to use eg
  `SETURIPRESENT`.  
  The remote responds with either `TRANSFER-SUCCESS` or
  `TRANSFER-FAILURE`, and a remote where exports do not make sense
  may always fail.
* `CHECKPRESENTEXPORT Key Name`  
  Requests the remote to check if a Name is present in it.  
  The remote responds with `CHECKPRESENT-SUCCESS`, `CHECKPRESENT-FAILURE`,
  or `CHECKPRESENT-UNKNOWN`.
* `REMOVEEXPORT Key Name`  
  Requests the remote to remove content stored by `TRANSFEREXPORT`.  
  The Key is provided in case the remote wants to use eg
  `SETURIMISSING`.
  The remote responds with either `REMOVE-SUCCESS` or
  `REMOVE-FAILURE`.
* `RENAMEEXPORT Key OldName NewName`  
  Requests the remote rename a file stored on it from OldName to NewName.  
  The Key is provided in case the remote wants to use eg 
  `SETURIMISSING` and `SETURIPRESENT`.  
  The remote responds with `RENAMEEXPORT-SUCCESS`,
  `RENAMEEXPORT-FAILURE`, or with `RENAMEEXPORT-UNSUPPORTED` if an efficient
  rename cannot be done.

To support old external special remote programs that have not been updated
to support exports, git-annex will need to handle an `ERROR` response
when using any of the above.

## location tracking

Does a copy of a file exported to a special remote count as a copy
of a file as far as [[numcopies]] goes? Should git-annex get download
a file from an export? Or should exporting not update location tracking?

The problem is that special remotes with exports are not
key/value stores. The content of a file can change, and if multiple
repositories can export a special remote, they can be out of sync about
what files are exported to it. 

To avoid such problems, when updating an exported file on a special remote,
the key could be recorded there too. But, this would have to be done
atomically, and checked atomically when downloading the file. Special
remotes lack atomicity guarantees for file storage, let alone for file
retrieval.

Possible solution: Make exporttree=true cause the special remote to
be untrusted, and rely on annex.verify to catch cases where the content
of a file on a special remote has changed. This would work well enough
except for when the WORM or URL backend is used. So, prevent the user
from exporting such keys. Also, force verification on for such special
remotes, don't let it be turned off.

## recording exported filenames in git-annex branch

In order to download the content of a key from a file exported
to a special remote, the filename that was exported needs to somehow
be recorded in the git-annex branch. How to do this? The filename could
be included in the location tracking log or a related log file, or 
the exported tree could be grafted into the git-annex branch
(under eg, `exported/uuid/`). Which way uses less space in the git repository?

Grafting in the exported tree records the necessary data, but the
file-to-key map needs to be reversed to support downloading from an export.
It would be too expensive to traverse the tree each time to hunt for a key;
instead would need a database that gets populated once by traversing the
tree.

On the other hand, for updating what's exported, having access to the old
exported tree seems perfect, because it and the new tree can be diffed to
find what changes need to be made to the special remote. 

If the filenames are stored in the location tracking log, the exported tree
could be reconstructed, but it would take O(N) queries to git, where N is
the total number of keys git-annex knows about; updating exports of small
subsets of large repositories would be expensive. So grafting in the
exported tree seems the better approach.

## export conflicts

What if different repositories can access the same special remote,
and different trees get exported to it concurrently?

This would be very hard to untangle, because it's hard to know what
content was exported to a file last, and thus what content the file
actually has. The location log's timestamps might give a hint, 
but clocks vary too much to trust it.

Also, if the exported tree is grafted in to the git-annex branch, 
there would be a merge conflict. Union merging would *scramble* the exported 
tree, so even if a smart merge is added, old versions of git-annex would 
corrupt the exported tree.

To avoid that problem, add a log file  `exported/uuid.log` that lists
the sha1 of the exported tree and the uuid of the repository that exported it.
To avoid the exported tree being GCed, do graft it in to the git-annex
branch, but follow that with a commit that removes the tree again,
and only update `refs/heads/git-annex` after making both commits.

If `exported/uuid.log` contains multiple active exports, there was an
export conflict. Short of downloading the whole export to checksum it,
or deleting the whole export, what can be done to resolve it?

In this case, git-annex knows both exported trees. Have the user provide
a tree that resolves the conflict as they desire (it could be the same as
one of the exported trees, or some merge of them). Then diff each exported
tree in turn against the resolving tree. If a file differs, re-export that
file. In some cases this will do unncessary re-uploads, but it's reasonably
efficient.

The documentation should suggest strongly only exporting to a given special
remote from a single repository, or having some other rule that avoids
export conflicts.
