git-annex is in a mode of continual user-driven improvement, involving numerous
small issues and often easily implemented ideas.

Here are open todo items that have been confirmed as worth doing and

[[!inline pages="todo/* and !todo/*/* and !todo/done and !link(todo/done) 
and link(todo/confirmed) and !link(todo/needsthought) and !*/Discussion and
!todo/moreinfo and !todo/confirmed and !todo/needsthought and
!todo/unlikely" template=buglist]]
