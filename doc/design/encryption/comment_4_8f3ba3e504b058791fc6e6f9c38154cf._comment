@Richard the easy way to deal with that scenario is to set up a remote that work can access, and only put in it files work should be able to see. Needing to specify which key a file should be encrypted to when putting it in a remote that supported multiple keys would add another level of complexity which that avoids.

Of course, the right approach is probably to have a separate repository for work. If you don't trust it with seeing file contents, you probably also don't trust it with the contents of your git repository.
