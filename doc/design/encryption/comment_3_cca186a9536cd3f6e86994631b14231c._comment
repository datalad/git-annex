Assuming you're storing your encrypted annex with me and I with you, our regular cron jobs to verify all data will catch corruption in each other's annexes.

Checksums of the encrypted objects could be optional, mitigating any potential attack scenarios.

It's not only about the cost of setting up new remotes. It would also be a way to keep data in one annex while making it accessible only in a subset of them. For example, I might need some private letters at work, but I don't want my work machine to be able to access them all.
