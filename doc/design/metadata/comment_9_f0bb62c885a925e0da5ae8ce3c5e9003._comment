Sorry for the noise, I see that tags _can_ be used for preferred content, excellent!

But it seems metadata is tied to a key, not to a specific file/path. If I have 10 different files all with the same content (for some reason, say a simple txt file, Gemspec, or something), and I want to tag one of them as important, it doesn't mean they all are :o
