Hi,

apologies if I am missing something, but from what I understand, git-annex will automatically add the year and the month from a file's mtime to its metadata if instructed to do so.

So... What about the day (or the time, for that matter?)?  What is the reasoning behind the decision not to add those bits automatically?  And, is there a way to get git-annex to add those bits of information automatically as well (besides the obvious way of creating a pre-commit-hook script to that effect)?

THX & Cheers,
Toby.
