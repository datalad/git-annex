Would love to be able to \"tag\" something as archived instead of moving it into a special folder. Coupled with a FinderSync extension on OS X Yosemite for right-click menu. This would allow me to also \"view\" the archive and bring things out of there by \"untagging\" it, if I understand the feature correctly?
