Hi,

I love the idea behing storing metadata.

I suggest to exchange ideas (and maybe code) with projects already implementing metadata systems.

I have tried several implementations and particularly noticed tmsu (http://tmsu.org/). This tool stores tags into a sqlite database and uses also a SHA-256 fingerprint of the file to be aware of file moves. It provides a fuse view of the tags with the ability to change tags by moving files (like in the git annex metadata view).

Paul Ruane is particularly responsive on the mailing list and he already supports git annexed files (with SHAE-256 fingerprint) (see the end of the thread https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/tmsu/A5EGpnCcJ2w).

Even if you cannot reuse the project, they are interresting ideas that might be worth looking at like the implications of tags: a file tagged \"film\" being automatically tagged \"video\".

Tagsistant (http://www.tagsistant.net/) may also be a good source of inspirations. I just don't like the fact that it uses a backstore of tagged files.

Thanks for reading.
