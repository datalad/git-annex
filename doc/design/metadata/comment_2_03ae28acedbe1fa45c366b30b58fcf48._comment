Some additional ideas for metadata...

Instead of having a simplistic scheme like 'field=value' it might be advantageous to consider a scheme like 'attribute=XXX, value=YYY, unit=ZZZ' that way you could do intesting things with the metadata like adding counters to things, and allow for doing interesting queries like give me all 'things' tagged with a unit of \"audio_file\", this assumes one had trawled through an entire annex and then tagged all files based on type with the unix file tool or something like that.

The above idea is already in use in irods and its a really nice and powerful way to let users add meta-data and to build up more interesting use cases and tools.

btw, I plan on taking a look at seeing if I can map some of the meta that we have in work into this new git-annex feature to see how well/bad it works. Either way this feature looks cool! +1!!!
