I suppose you're talking about preferred content settings.

I think that it makes sense for hooks to use existing git-annex plumbing etc when it's available. So a hook could just run `git annex wanted` to manage its preferred content.

The only problem is that a hook does not currently have a way to discover the UUID of the repository! So I've added a GETUUID to cover this and other use cases.
