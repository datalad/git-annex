It says: \"Note that the File should not influence the filename used on the remote. The filename used should be derived from the Key.\"

Thus this interface might not be useful to implement [[todo/New special remote suggeston - clean directory]]? The clean directory special remote would just do that: save $key content on the remote under the filename $file.
