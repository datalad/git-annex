could you express your expert choice explicitly among those 3 choices how I should react to WHEREIS in my (archives) case

1. report the same url
2. \"spell it out\"
3. WHEREIS-FAILURE

or really not implement it at all? (we are still at VERSION 1, so I thought that not implementing it might lead to some undesired side-effects)
