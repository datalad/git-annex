DIRHASH-LOWER (and I assume the other DIRHASH commands as well) seem to respond with a path ending with a slash. So `VALUE abc/def/` instead of the `VALUE abc/def` example mentioned. `git-annex-remote-rclone` actually assumes the response ends with a slash. Is this indeed what git-annex guarantees? If so, it should probably be documented in this specification.
