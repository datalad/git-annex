I think the hook running anything in shell, to interact with git annex, is a mistake.

I see a lot more potential pitfalls and mistakes(especially crossplatform). 

It should be the existing git annex plumbing (preferred content) as you say. I just really think it should be configurable in the protocol, instead of a having to run a shell command. 

Since you have made this advanced protocol i really see it as a mistake to do anything between the hook and git-annex outside of the protocol, it makes much more sense to have all their interactions happen within the protocol.

IMO anyways.
