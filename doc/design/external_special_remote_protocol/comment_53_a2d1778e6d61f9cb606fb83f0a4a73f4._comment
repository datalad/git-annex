Is it possible to somehow make `git annex whereis` show the response of the special remote to `WHEREIS` over multiple lines? Just including newlines obviously results in an error, since that ends the WHEREIS-SUCCESS message.

I am implementing a special remote for which the data is fully described by what is essentially a json-encoded request to a third-party API, and I would like to show this json string pretty-printed over multiple lines in the whereis output, instead of as a single line.
