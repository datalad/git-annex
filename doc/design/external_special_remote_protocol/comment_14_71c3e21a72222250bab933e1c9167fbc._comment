Schnouki, fixed SETCONFIG docs. Note that this is a wiki. :)

I agree it's a little weird for SETCREDS to have a username and a password. This is just exposing git-annex's existing credential storage which has a tuple of values rather than using, say, a multivalue map. If you only need one it's fine to put in a dummy value for the other one.

Re PROGRESS, it seems I hooked up the progress stuff, so it was visible in the webapp, but forgot to put up a progress display at the command line. Fixed in git.

I look forward to seeing your special remote implementation!
