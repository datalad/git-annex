Joey, thanks for fixing that so quickly. Indeed it works in the webapp; I'll check the CLI version as soon as possible :)

I just released the new remote on <https://github.com/Schnouki/git-annex-remote-hubic>. It's for [hubiC](https://hubic.com/), a French personal cloud storage service made by OVH that has free 25GB accounts and only charges â‚¬10/month for 10TB (VAT included). It's really experimental (hacked it over the weekend), but it seems to work for me so far.
