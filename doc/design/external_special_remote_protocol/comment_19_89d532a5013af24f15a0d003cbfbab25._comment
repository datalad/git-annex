There's no point in implementing WHEREIS if it's going to reply with the
same values that are passed to SETURIPRESENT.

Some special remotes may not need to use SETURIPRESENT to work at
all, and yet storing data on the remote makes it available from some public
url. This is the kind of situation where it makes sense to implement
WHEREIS.
