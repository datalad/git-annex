@szrc, it's pretty expensive to pull encrypted creds out of the git 
repository and run gpg to decrypt them. Doing so also tends to result
in a gpg password prompt. 

Rather than do that every time git-annex needs the creds to access the
remote, it maintains a local cache file, which has its permissions set so
only the local user (and root, naturally) can read it.
