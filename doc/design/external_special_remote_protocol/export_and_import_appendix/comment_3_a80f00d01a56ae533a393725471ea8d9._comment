I have a use case for the importree protocol extensions:

I would like to ingest photos and documents from my familys iCloud share.

I am planning on using git-annex with the new [rclone special remote](https://git-annex.branchable.com/forum/New_external_special_remote_for_rclone/) to do so.
rclone is just in the process of [adding support for a new iCloud drive/photos remote](https://github.com/rclone/rclone/pull/7717) to make it feasible.

The missing piece is that we can not yet import/sync a tree of files from rclone into my annex.

@joeyh.name I would be quite interested to work with you on getting this supported.
