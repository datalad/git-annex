@stv0g I'm pretty busy with other features, on the other hand implementing
the git-annex side of this would not really be that hard. It's making sure
that git-annex doesn't encourage lots of unsafe things to be built with
the export/import interface that seems hard to me.

Would you need the full export/import interface though?
[[todo/importtree_only_remotes]] would be enough if you only want to
import, and it avoids the tricky question of how to avoid data loss
due to overwriting a modified file in your implementation of
STOREEXPORTEXPECTED.

On the other hand, if rclone provides something that can be used 
as a good ContentIdentifier, and has a way to avoid a store overwriting a
modified file, it would be great to have this interface.
