Is there a reason that DIRHASH in type=external uses a different format (mixed-case) from that used by type=directory (lower-case)? Or, could there be e.g. `DIRHASH LOWER` to select between the formats?

I'm writing an external remote for SMB filesystem access and I'd like its storage to be usable via type=directory in case of emergencies or other reasons, but  with different dirhash layouts that's not going to work, I assume...
