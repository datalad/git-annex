You can find out the size of a key by using 
`git-annex examinekey $key --format='${bytesize}\n'` 
(There's a --batch option to avoid needing to spin up
repeated such processes.)

I suppose I could add a PROGRESSPRECENT, but any version of git-annex that
didn't support it would fail with a protocol error if a special remote
tried to use that. So, the special remote would need to check git-annex
version to use it.

So, maybe better to get the size of the key yourself, and convert the
percentage to bytes for PROGRESS.
