First things first: in the documentation, I think `SETCONFIG Setting` should be `SETCONFIG Setting Value`.

Now a few questions:

- why have `SETCREDS` and `GETCREDS` have both a username and a password? I'd like to use them to store a OAuth token, but because of this I also have to store a dummy value, which seems weird to me. Is it possible to just do `SETCREDS oauth_token XXXYYY123456`?
- about `PROGRESS`: my remote is sending `PROGRESS xxx` every 64kb uploaded or downloaded, but no upload/download progress is displayed by git-annex. Is this normal? Should I do it myself, or will it be done by a future version of git-annex?

Joey, thanks a lot for all your work on git-annex :)
