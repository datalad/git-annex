> TODO: stream the file up/down the pipe, rather than using a temp file

You might want to use chunked transfer, i.e. a series of \"EXPECT 65536\" followed by that many bytes of binary data and an EOF marker (EXPECT-END or EXPECT 0), instead of escaping three characters (newline, NUL, and the escape prefix) and the additional unnecessary tedious per-character processing that would require.
