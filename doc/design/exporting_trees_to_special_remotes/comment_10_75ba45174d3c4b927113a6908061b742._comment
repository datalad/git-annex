In some cases, if remote supports versioning, might be cool to be able to export all versions (from previously exported point, assuming linear progression).
Having a chat with [https://quiltdata.com/](https://quiltdata.com/) folks, project which I just got to know about.
1. They claim/hope to provide infinite storage for public datasets
2. They do support \"File\" model, so dataset could simply contain files.  If we could (ab)use that -- sounds like a lovely free ride
3. They do support versioning. If we could export all the versions -- super lovely.  

Might also help to establish interoperability between the tools
