or it could be just a mode of operation for a special remote depending on \"exporttree=true\" being set, where in one (old) case it would operate based on keys associated with the files pointed on the cmdline (or just keys for --auto or pointed by metadata), whenever when \"exporttree=true\" -- it would operate on filenames pointed on command line (or files found to be associated with the keys as pointed by --auto or by metadata)? 
Then the same 'copy --to' could be used in both cases, streamlining user experience ;)
