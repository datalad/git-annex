In `TRANSFEREXPORT STORE|RETRIEVE Key File Name`, it should always
be possible for the File to not contain spaces in its name. But it could be
rather painful for git-annex to avoid spaces in some cases (would need to
link or copy the annexed file content). So well spotted. 

Hmm, it's actually possible for a Key to contain spaces as well,
at least with the WORM backend.

The protocol `VERSION` is picked by the special remote, it's not
negotiated.
