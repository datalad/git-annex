Since [[bugs/external_special_remote_protocol_broken_by_key_with_spaces]]
was fixed, the Key can't contain spaces any longer.

The File could still contain spaces, eg when exporting from a direct mode
repository where the worktree filename contains spaces.

In `RENAMEEXPORT`, both OldName and NewName could contain spaces.
