I've updated the proposed external special remote protocol to avoid the
whitespace concerns. Not wild about needing a separate EXPORT request,
which will probably get shoved into a global variable in most
implementations. But it does avoid needing to use some kind of encoding,
which would complicate implementations more, I feel.
