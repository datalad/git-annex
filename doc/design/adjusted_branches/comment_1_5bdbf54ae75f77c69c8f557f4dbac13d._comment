I am yet to grasp all the glorious plans here, but wondered to ask:  it seems like it then should be possible to establish a branch only with annexed archive? may be matching some preferred content expression?
Usecase:  a relatively large git/annex repository mixing in code, large data files, and some pre-built binaries.  If I could seamlessly and reproducibly (with the progress of their master) tease those apart (for separate Debian packaging ;)), that would be really handy
