I'm having hard time supporting the following use case with git-annex:

* using git annex so that \"git annex sync --content\" import in batch pictures from a camera SD card
* destination of the import is a \"pictures/INCOMING\" subdir of a larger \"multimedia archive\" annex
* I do not want to have all the other folders of the annex (parent and siblings of pictures/INCOMING) present on the SD card

I wonder if adjusted branches might be a solution to this.
Do I get it right that \"unlocked\" is currently the only supported kind of adjustment?

If so, I'm not sure what would be needed to make the above use case feasible.
At first sight though, commits int the adjusted branch that \"mounts\" pictures/INCOMING/ are conceptually easy to translate to the main branch: the changes would be the same, only they'll have to be applied in a specific subtree.
They won't merge cleanly though.

Is this an interesting/worthwhile use case for adjusted branches, or am I looking into the wrong part of git-annex design?

Thanks for this amazing tool!
