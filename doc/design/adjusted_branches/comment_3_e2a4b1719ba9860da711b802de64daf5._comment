Another good use case for this would be adjusting the target paths of symlinks for non-standard locations of the .git/annex/objects folder, such as when cloning into a repo where the GIT_DIR is outside the worktree folder, or when someone is using multiple worktrees and the links in other worktrees need to point to the GIT_COMMON_DIR.
