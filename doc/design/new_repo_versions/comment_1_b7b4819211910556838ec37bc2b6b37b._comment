My gut feeling for incompatible changes in v6 is to somehow make v5 and below error out on all merges with a v6 repo.

Conversely, v6 git-annex running in v6 repos would transition all data while merging in v5 repos.

As a migration path for existing repos, you could move `git-annex` and `master` to `git-annex_v5` and `master_v5`. Once you are certain all known repos within that repo group are transitioned, either kill the v5 branches automagically or print info on cli/web UI on what needs to be run to get rid of them.

Having several plain git 1+ GiB repos (i.e. without any annex objects), I would love to transition after v6 and the migration paths have been hung a month or three to dry.
