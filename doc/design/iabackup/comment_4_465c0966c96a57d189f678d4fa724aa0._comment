The good news is that web-archive (.ARC) items are not publicly browsable, and that's about half of the archive's content, so you're only looking at about 10PB to backup.

The bad news is that unless you can work something out with archive.org (which seems unlikely; web-archive items are restricted to protect them legally), or use the old waybackup interface (which I don't think works anymore), or use the wayback machine (which last I heard only supported a few hundred connections per second) you'll only be able to back up half their data.

Still, non-web items seem like a nice place to start.
