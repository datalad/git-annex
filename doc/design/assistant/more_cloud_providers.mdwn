Git-annex already supports storing large files in 
several cloud providers via [[special_remotes]].
More should be added, such as:

* Google drive (attractive because it's free, only 5 gb tho)
* Owncloud (has several [providers](http://owncloud.org/providers/);
  at least one provides 5 gb free; open DAV based API)
* OpenStack Swift (teh future)
* Box.com (it's free, and current method is hard to set up and a sorta
  shakey; a better method would be to use its API) **done**
* Dropbox? That would be ironic.. Via its API, presumably.
* [[Amazon Glacier|todo/special_remote_for_amazon_glacier]] **done**
* Internet Archive **done**
* Mediafire provides 50gb free and has a REST API.
* Flickr provides 1 tb (!!!!) to free accounts, and can store at least
  photos and videos. <https://github.com/ricardobeat/filr> is a hack
  to allow storing any type of file on Flickr.
* mega.co.nz. Already supported via [[tips/megaannex]], would just need
  webapp modifications to configure it. May want to use megaannex as-is to
  build a non-hook special remote in haskell.
