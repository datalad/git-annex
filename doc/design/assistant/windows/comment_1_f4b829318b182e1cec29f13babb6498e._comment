NTFS symbolic links should do exactly what you would expect them to do. They can point to files or directories. Junction points are legacy NTFS functionality and reparse points are more like the POSIX mount functionality.

NTFS symbolic links should work for you, junction point should be avoided, and reparse points would be like using a nuke to kill a fly. The only hang up you might have is that I think all three features require elevated privileges to manage.
