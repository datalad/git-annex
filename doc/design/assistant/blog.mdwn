This blog was updated on a semi-daily basis by Joey during the year of work
concentrating on the git-annex assistant that was funded by his kickstarter
campaign.

Post-kickstarter work will instead appear on the [[devblog]]. However,
this page's RSS feed will continue to work, so you don't have to migrate
your RSS reader.
