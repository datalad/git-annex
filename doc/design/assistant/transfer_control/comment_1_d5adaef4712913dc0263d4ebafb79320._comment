You could try to do it similar to [RT](http://bestpractical.com/rt/):

* Implement saved statements, i.e. offer common use cases
* Allow those statements (or aliases? stanzas?) to be loaded in a relatively simple editor with a basic wizard to support the building of new rules
* Offer a free-text input for advanced users. It should be able to parse that and load it into the simple editor.
* Users should be able to save, export, and import those statements.
* Optionally, allow users to dry run the rules by showing them what git-annex needs to do to fulfill the requirements set by the statements.
