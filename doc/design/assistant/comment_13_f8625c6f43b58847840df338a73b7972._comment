@JÃ¶rn, two days ago I added support in the webapp for multiple independent repositories. So you can create independent repos using it, and switch between them from a menu. Under the hood there are multiple git-annex assistant daemons running, but this is an implementation detail; it's not like these use any more memory or other resources than would a single daemon that managed multiple repositories.
