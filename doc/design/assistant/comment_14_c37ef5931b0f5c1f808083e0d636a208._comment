joey, you rock. I just want to push on that point - it doesn't seem like there's that many tools that do what git-annex is trying to do out there, and you seem to be doing an incredible job at doing it, so this is great, keep going!

i was wondering - i am glad to see the progress, but it is unclear to me where you actually are in the roadmap. are things going according to plan? are we at month 3? 4? or 1-4? :) just little updates on that roadmap section above would be quite useful!

thanks again!
