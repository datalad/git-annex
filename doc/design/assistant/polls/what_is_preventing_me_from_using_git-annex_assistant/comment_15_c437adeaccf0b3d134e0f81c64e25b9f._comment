BTW,

Does this still apply?

\"I'd like git annex direct to set the repository to untrusted, but I didn't do it. Partly because having git annex indirect set it back to semitrusted seems possibly wrong -- the user might not trust a repo even in indirect mode. Or might fully trust it. The docs will encourage users to set direct mode repos to untrusted -- in direct mode you're operating without large swathes of git-annex's carefully constructed safety net. (When the assistant later uses direct mode, it'll untrust the repository automatically.)\"
