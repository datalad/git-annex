@joey: My usecase is fairly simple. 
I have a working directory where I do work 
(not programing, but text editing with homecooked spreadsheet/texteditor).

I work/type on spot/on site. So I'm walking while typing.

Its easy to do stupid things while you work, 
so would be really handy to have a backup automagically on the same computer to prevent mistakes, user errors.
(The last mistake, I did is I copied all my daily files into a \"tmp\" directory, 
then I launched my homebrew program which also created a tmp dir then deleted the whole content of it. 
I fixed it, but my datas was lost. It is a simple user mistake which could be prevented if I would have a 
live backup all the time. Creating a git repo for daily typing is just too much overhead. 
It is like you create a git repo for your text messages...)

So my usecase is a live backup. Or the broken file deleting thing on unix/linux since forever.

Laszlo
