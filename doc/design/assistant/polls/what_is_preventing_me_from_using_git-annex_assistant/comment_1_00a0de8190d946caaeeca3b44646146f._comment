As of right now, the assistant has only secondary benefit over plain git-annex inasmuch there's a lot more code activity.

As soon as the assistant supports Android, I will use for syncing photos off of my phone and may start to use the assistant on my usual repos as a natural consequence.

Additionally, there's a subjective feeling of more bugs being reported. That may or may not be true, but as long as there's no Android port, I don't have an actual reason to \"risk\" it.

PS: This seems to be the first poll where you can place only one vote while it's the first where I really wanted to vote on two separate items.
