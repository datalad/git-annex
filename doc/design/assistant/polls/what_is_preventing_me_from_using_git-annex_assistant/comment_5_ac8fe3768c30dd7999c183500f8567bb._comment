Really looking forward to seeing this project go forward and impressed by what you have accomplished.

I have my own server which I want to use as a repository, so I'll choose \"Remote server\". I want to use direct mode.
Now I can only create an encrypted remote which is fine for me, but I don't know how to sync that with another client using this remote.

Also with the generated ssh keys I no longer can log into my server normally as it tries to use the generated keys.
The generated keys should also be restricted to only be able to change the repository and nothing else.

Maybe webdav could be used to create something with better access control and repositories for groups etc.
Also with a simple web upload/download page, similar to dropbox.

Sorry if my post is long and idiotic, just simple (hopefully constructive) feedback from a simple user :)
