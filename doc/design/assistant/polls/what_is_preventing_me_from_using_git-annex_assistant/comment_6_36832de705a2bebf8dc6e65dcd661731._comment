Laszlo's concern about \"you can only select a drive and not a directory\" relates to a problem I had.

I have two local directories, ~/annex indirect my main annex, and ~/directannex for playing with direct mode.

I had hoped to back each up to the same shared drive, but didn't realize there was no option to select a directory within a shared drive, so when I tried to do that through the assistant I inadvertently connected the two by backing them up to the same directory on the shared drive!

This is probably a \"power user problem\" which has a \"power user solution\" of setting up the separate repository manually.  But it did take me by surprise.
