Not sure where the correct place to ask this is...

My use case for git-annex is to back up important files (pictures, videos, etc.) on a hard disk at work and one at home. Is there an easy way to do that? I'd like to be able to get git-annex to fill up my phone/laptop with files that it thinks are backed up in <2 of the locations, and ferry them back and forth. They can be deleted to free up space after that, if necessary.

Thanks for all your work, by the way. I missed the kickstarter, but if there's a simple and direct way to donate (dwolla?, gittip?), I'd love to chip in.
