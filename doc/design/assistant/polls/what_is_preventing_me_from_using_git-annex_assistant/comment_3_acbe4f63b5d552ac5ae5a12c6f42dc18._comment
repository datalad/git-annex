I've got a few wishes for git-annexâ€¦  Referring to the poll options:

- I need an Android port

I think this is the biggest issue for getting a high WAF.  (I want to put our photos in an annex, and getting them auto-magically off her phone would get me massive brownie points.)

- Initially the lack of direct-mode. Now concerns about the safety of direct mode. Perhaps after the next release.

The \"potentially unsafe\" sort of comments in the blog make me worry about trusting my data to the direct mode.  Saying that I *really* appreciate the honesty of the comments.  That is why I want to keep using, and recommend to others, git-annex.

- I haven't always well understood the differences between commandline operation & the assistant, so the differences would confuse me, and I found the command line more understandable & less scary. Now trying to learn to like & trust the assistant.

I also have worried about the automatic adding by the assistant - prior to direct mode.

- throttling transfers, it upsets people when I saturate the connection

I think a bittorrent option would be ideal.  Not public torrents, but torrents between my annexes.
