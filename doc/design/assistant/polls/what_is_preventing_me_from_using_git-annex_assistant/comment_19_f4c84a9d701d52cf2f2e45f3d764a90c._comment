Hi,

my company would need this for some project.

But to adopt it I would need:
* windows support (I don't care if now symlink support for now)
* being able to define which files are automatically synced using a syntax similar to the gitignore one
* being able to disable auto-commit (just synching, user should be able to commit on their own)

thanks
