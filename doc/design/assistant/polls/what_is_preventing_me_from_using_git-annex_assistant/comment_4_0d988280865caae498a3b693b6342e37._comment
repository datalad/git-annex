Here is my usecase:
I want two local (direct mode) repositories. So basically a working directory and a backup directory to the working one.

The removable media repository *almost* fulfill this usecase, except you can only select drive and not a directory.
I think it would be relatively simple to implement. (A drive is a directory under linux after all).

Best, 
 Laszlo
