This is slightly off topic, but from my perspective this Kickstarter project has been a riotous success, and due to the credibility you have built up from 9 months of consistently high quality work produced in a very transparent and community-oriented fashion, I'd be surprised if you weren't able to raise more money to continue development after the 12 months is up.  Assuming you want to of course :)  Maybe you need a break or change of scene.  But if not, it would be a shame not to continue if the userbase wants it.
