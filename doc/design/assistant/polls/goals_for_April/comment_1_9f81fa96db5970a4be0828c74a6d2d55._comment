Having duplicate files is fairly easy. 
a) Just a backup of your files, to not have accidental deleting.

b) Some programs implements UNDO command (Ctrl-Z) as simply copying over the working text file
to a backup directory. 

c) If you tests precompiled programs, like git annex itself, it has identical files across releases.


For more info about duplicate files, read hear these two bugreports:
