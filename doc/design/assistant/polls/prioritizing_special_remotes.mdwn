Background: git-annex supports storing data in various [[special remotes]].
The git-annex assistant will make it easy to configure these, and easy
configurators have already been built for a few: removable drives, rsync.net,
locally paired systems, and remote servers with rsync.

Help me prioritize my work: What special remote would you most like
to use with the git-annex assistant?

[[!poll open=yes 18 "Amazon S3 (done)" 13 "Amazon Glacier (done)" 10 "Box.com (done)" 77 "My phone (or MP3 player)" 29 "Tahoe-LAFS" 17 "OpenStack SWIFT" 37 "Google Drive"]]

This poll is ordered with the options I consider easiest to build
listed first. Mostly because git-annex already supports them and they
only need an easy configurator. The ones at the bottom are likely to need
significant work. See [[cloud]] for detailed discussion.

Have another idea? Absolutely need two or more? Post comments..
