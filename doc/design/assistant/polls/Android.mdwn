Help me choose a goal for the month of December. The last poll showed 
a lot of interest in using the git-annex assistant with phones, etc.

Background: git-annex uses symbolic links in its repositories. This makes it
hard to use with filesystems, such as FAT, that do not support symbolic links.
FAT filesystems are the main storage available on some Android devices that
have a micro-SD card. Other, newer Android devices don't have a SD card and so
avoid this problem.

I can either work on the idea described in
[[design/assistant/desymlink]], which could solve the symlink problem and
also could lead to a nicer workflow to editing files that are stored in
git-annex.

Or, I can work on [[Android_porting|design/assistant/android]], and try to
get the assistant working on Android's built-in storage.

[[!poll open=no 81 "solve the symlink problem first" 17 "port to Android first" 1 "other"]]
