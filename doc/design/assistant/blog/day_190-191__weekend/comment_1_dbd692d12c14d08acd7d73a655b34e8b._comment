In your research to see how to bundle up a graphical android app, I suggest you read up on phonegap: http://phonegap.com/

Essentially they bundle webkit so you can turn a web app into an android app. Not sure if they help you ship native/binary stuff along side the html/javascript/css, but phonegap should at least be useful as a reference for how to do some of the bundling-related stuff.
