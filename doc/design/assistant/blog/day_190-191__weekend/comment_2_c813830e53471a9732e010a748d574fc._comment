Hi,

I just tried the newest git annex webapp (20130216), 
I am still not able to configure two direct mode repositories (one normal, one backup) on the same computer.

It does recognize my other partition (/mnt/the) as a removable drive, but when I add it 
it gives me internal server error:
\"\"\"
Internal Server Error

there is no available git remote named \"the\"
git-annex version 3.20130216
\"\"\"

Could you please (pretty please) add a possibility to specify the removable drive as a simple folder?
So I could choose arbitrary folder(/mnt/the/annex-backup) on my computer and 
it would treat it as a direct mode repository.

Best, 
 Laszlo
