Built a SRV lookup library that can use either `host` or ADNS.

Worked on DBUS reconnection some more; found a FD leak in the dbus library,
and wrote its long-suffering author, John Millikin (also the XMPP library
author, so I've been bothering him a lot lately), who once again came
through with a quick fix.

Built a XMPP configuration form, that tests the connection to the server.
Getting the wording right on this was hard, and it's probably still not
100% right.

Pairing over XMPP is something I'm still thinking about. It's
contingent on tunneling git over XMPP (actually not too hard),
and getting a really secure XMPP connection (needs library improvements,
as the library currently accepts any SSL certificate).
