Hi Joey,

while you wait for some actual Android device have you tried the emulator?

I've recently started playing with Android without any physical device, and the emulator is pretty responsive with hardware acceleration on (you need to run an x86 AVD).

Here are some instructions: http://git.ao2.it/android/android-app-development-getting-started.git/blob/HEAD:/android-app-development-getting-started.sh

Also, are you going to use a WebView connecting to the haskell web server for the WebApp?

Ciao,
   Antonio
