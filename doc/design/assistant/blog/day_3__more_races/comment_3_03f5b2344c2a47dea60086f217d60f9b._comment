For the unfamiliar, it's hard to tell if a command like that would persist.  I'd suggest being as clear as possible, e.g.:

    Increase the limit for now by running:
      sudo sysctl fs.inotify.max_user_watches=81920
    Increase the limit now and automatically at every boot by running:
      echo fs.inotify.max_user_watches=81920 | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf; sudo sysctl -p
