Fuzz tester has found several interesting bugs that I've now fixed. It's
even found a bug in my fixes. Most of the problems the fuzz testing has
found have had to do with direct mode merges, and automatic merge conflict
resoltion. Turns out the second level of automatic merge conflict
resolution (where the changes made to resolve a merge conflict themselves
turn out conflict in a later merge) was buggy, for example.

So, didn't really work a lot today -- was not intending to work at all
actually -- but have still accomplished a lot.

(Also, Tobias contributed [[tips/dropboxannex]] .. I'll be curious to see
what the use case for that is, if any!)
