When I wasn't dealing with the snowstorm today, I was fixing more bugs.
Rather serious bugs.

One actually involved corruption to git-annex's location tracking info, due
to a busted three-way merge. Takes an unusual set of circumstances for that
bug to be triggered, which is why it was not noticed before now. Also,
since git-annex is designed to not trust its location tracking info, and
recover from it becoming inconsistent, someone could have experienced the
bug and not really noticed it. Still it's a serious problem and I'm in debt
to user a-or-b for developing a good test case that let me reproduce it and
fix it. (Also added to the test suite.)

Another bug made `git add; git commit` cause data loss in direct mode.
I was able to make that not lose data, although it still does something
that's unlikely to be desired, unless the goal is to move a file from an
annexed direct mode file to having its entire contents stored in git.

Also found a bug with sync's automatic resolution of git conflicts. It
failed when two repositories both renamed a file to different names.
I had neglected to explicitly `git rm` the old file name, which is
necessary to resolve such a conflict.
