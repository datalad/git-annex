Worked on 3 interesting bugs today. One I noticed myself while doing tests
with adding many thousands of files yesterday. Assistant was delaying
making a last commit of the batch of files, and would only wake up and
commit them after a further change was made. Turns out this bug was
introduced in April while improving commit batching when making very large
commits. I seem to remember someone mentioning this problem at some point,
but I have not been able to find a bug report to close.

Also tried to reproduce [[this_bug|bugs/utf8]]. Frustrating, because I'm
quite sure I have made changes that will avoid it happening again,
but since I still don't know what the root cause was, I can't let it go.

The last bug is
[[non-repos_in_repositories_list___40__+_other_weird_output__41___from_git_annex_status]]
and is a most strange thing. Still trying to get a handle on multiple
aspects of it.

Also various other bug triage. Down to only 10 messages in my git-annex
folder.  That included merging about a dozen bugs about
local pairing, that all seem to involve git-annex-shell not being found in
path. Something is up with that..
