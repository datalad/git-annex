An Android autobuilder is now set up to run nightly. At this point
I don't see an immediate way to getting the webapp working on Android, so
it's best to wait a month or two and see how things develop in Haskell land.
So I'm moving on to other things.

Today:

* Fixed a nasty regression that made `*` not match files in subdirectories.
  That broke the preferred content handling, among other things. I will
  be pushing out a new release soon.
* As a last Android thing (for now), made the Android app automatically
  run `git annex assistant --autostart` , so you can manually set up
  an assistant-driven repository on Android, listing the repository in
  `.config/git-annex/autostart`
* Made the webapp display any error message from `git init` if it fails.
  This was the one remaining gap in the logging.
  One reason it could fail is if the system has a newer git in use, and
  `~/.gitconfig` is configured with some options the older git bundled
  with git-annex doesn't like.
* Bumped the major version to 4, and annex.version will be set to 4 in
  new direct mode repositories. (But version 3 is otherwise still used, to
  avoid any upgrade pain.) This is to prevent old versions that don't
  understand direct mode from getting confused. I hope direct mode is
  finally complete, too, after the work to make it work on crippled
  filesystems this month.
* Misc other bugfixes etc. Backlog down to 43.
