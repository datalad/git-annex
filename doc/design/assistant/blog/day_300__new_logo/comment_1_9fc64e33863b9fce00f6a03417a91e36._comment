Yeah, with the last name of \"Pfl端ger\" I also usually find bugs having to do with the letter \"端\". (-;
I guess it is simply one of the more frequent german umlauts, especially in names (the classic \"M端ller\", which is one of the most common last names in Germany). And apparently the German cabal strikes here again.
