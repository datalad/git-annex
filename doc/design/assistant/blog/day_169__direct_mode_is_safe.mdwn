I've finished making direct mode file transfers safe. The last piece of the
puzzle was making `git-annex-shell recv-key` check data it's received from
direct mode repositories. This is a bit expensive, but avoids adding
another round-trip to the protocol. I might revisit this later, this was
just a quick fix.

The [[poll|polls/what is preventing me from using git-annex assistant]] was 
quite useful. Some interesting points:

* 14% have been reading this blog, and rightly don't trust direct mode to
  be safe. Which is why I went ahead with a quick fix to make it safe.
* 6% want an Ubuntu PPA. I don't anticipate doing this myself, but
  if anyone who develops for Ubuntu wants to put together a PPA with a
  newer version, I can help you pick the newer haskell packages you'll
  need from Debian, etc.
* 9% just need me to update the amd64 build in Debian sid. I forgot to
  include it in the last release, and the Debian buildds cannot currently
  autobuild git-annex due to some breakage in the versions of haskell
  libraries in unstable. Hopefully I'll remember to include an amd64 build
  in my next release.

And lots of other interesting stuff, I have a nice new TODO list now. :)
