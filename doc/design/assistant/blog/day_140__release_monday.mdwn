New release today, the main improvements in this one being WebDAV,
Box.com, and Amazon glacier support. [[/assistant/release_notes]]

Collected together all the OSX problem reports into one place
at [[/assistant/OSX]], to make it easier to get an overview of them.

Did some testing of the OSX standalone app and found that it was missing
some libraries. It seems some new libraries it's using themselves depend on
other libraries, and `otool -L` doesn't recursively resolve this. 

So I converted the simplistic shell script it was using to install
libraries into a haskell progream that recursively adds libraries until
there are no more to add. It's pulling in quite a lot more libraries now.
This may fix some of the problems that have been reported with the
standalone app; I don't really know since I can only do very limited
testing on OSX.

Still working on getting the standalone builds for this release done,
should be done by the end of today.

Also found a real stinker of a bug in `dirContentsRecursive`, which was
just completely broken, apparently since day 1. Fixing that has certainly
fixed buggy behavior of `git annex import`. It seems that the other
user of it, the transfer log code, luckily avoided the deep directory
trees that triggered the bug.
