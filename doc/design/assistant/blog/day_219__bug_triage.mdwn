Triaged some of the older bugs and was able to close a lot of them.

Should mention that I will be in Boston this weekend, attending
[LibrePlanet 2013](http://libreplanet.org/wiki/LibrePlanet:Conference/2013).
Drop by and find me, I'll have git-annex stickers! ;)

Did some UI work on the webapp. Minor stuff, but stuff that needed to be
fixed up. Like inserting zero-width spaces into filenames displayed in it
so very long filenames always get reasonably wrapped by the browser.
(Perhaps there's a better way to do that with CSS?)
