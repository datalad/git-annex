Hi Joey,
Having installed this release (x86_64) on Debian wheezy I get the following error when I try to run git-annex:
    
    git-annex: /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6: version `GLIBC_2.14' not found (required by git-annex)
    git-annex: /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6: version `GLIBC_2.14' not found (required by $HOME/.local/share/git-annex//usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libidn.so.11)
    
etc. for at least a dozen libraries. Different libs try to find different glibc version (2.14, 2.15, 2.16, 2.17). Previous releases were linked with GLIBC_2.13.
