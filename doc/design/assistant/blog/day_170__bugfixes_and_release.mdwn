Fixed a goodly amount of bugs today.

The most interesting change was that in direct mode, files using the same
key are no longer hardlinked, as that could cause a surprising behavior if
modifying one, where the other would also change.

Made a release, which is almost entirely bug fixes. Debian amd64 build
included this time. :)
