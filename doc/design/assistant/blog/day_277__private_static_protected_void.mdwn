Yeah, Java hacking today. I have something that I think should deal with
the [[bugs/Android_app_permission_denial_on_startup]] problem. Added a "Open
WebApp" item to the terminal's menu, which should behave as advertised.
This is available in the Android daily build now, if your device has that
problem.

I was not able to get the escape sequence hack to work. I had no difficulty
modifying the terminal to send an intent to open an url when it received a
custom escape sequence. But sending the intent just seemed to lock up the
terminal for a minute without doing anything. No idea why. I had to propigate a
context object in to the terminal emulator through several layers of objects.
Perhaps that doesn't really work despite what I [read on stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9051849/opening-a-link-in-the-browser/9052208#9052208).

Anyway, that's all I have time to do. It would be nice if I, or some other
interested developer who is more comfortable with Java, could write a custom
Android frontend app, that embedded a web browser widget for the webapp,
rather than abusing the terminal this way. OTOH, this way does provide the
bonus of a pretty good terminal and git shell environment for Android to go
with git-annex.
