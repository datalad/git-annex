Using `annex` as default is fine, but even non-technical users will need a way to create different annexes for different usage. Or if two users share one thumb drive and each has their own annex. Long story short, I don't think this is an expert option, but something every user should be able to change immediately.

A pre-populated text area makes most sense, imo.
