Actually did do some work on the webapp today, just fixing a bug I noticed
in a spare moment. Also managed a bit in the plane earlier this week,
implementing resuming of paused transfers. (Still need to test that.)

But the big thing today was dinner with one of my major Kickstarter
backers, and as it turned out, "half the Haskell community of San
Francisco" (3 people). Enjoyed talking about git-annex and haskell with
them.

I'm looking forward to getting back home and back to work on Monday..
