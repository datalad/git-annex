There seem to be a steady state of enough bug reports coming in that I can
work on them whenever I'm not working on anything else. As I did all day
today.

This doesn't bother me if the bug reports are of real bugs that I can
reproduce and fix, but I'm spending a lot of time currently following up to
messages and asking simple questions like "what version number" and "can I
please see the whole log file". And just trying to guess what a vague
problem report means and read people's minds to get to a definite bug
with a test case that I can then fix.

I've noticed the overall quality of bug reports nosedive over the past
several months. My guess is this means that git-annex has found a less
technical audience. I need to find something to do about this.

With that whining out of the way ...
I fixed a pretty ugly bug on FAT/Android today, and
I am 100% caught up on messages right now!
