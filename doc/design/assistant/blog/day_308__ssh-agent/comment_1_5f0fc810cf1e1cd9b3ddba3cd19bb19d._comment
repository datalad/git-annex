This behaviour of ssh has bugged me for years now (I even think it is an information leak â€“ ssh offers basically all my public ssh keys to every server I try to connect to, even though that public key might be confidential). Although it had nothing to do with git-annex, you helped me a _lot_ by pointing me towards IdentitiesOnly. Really a nice setting!

Cheers,

Mika
