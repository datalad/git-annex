Spent a lot of time this weekend thinking about/stuck on the [[cloud]]
notification problem. Currently IRC is looking like the best way for
repositories to notify one-another when changes are made, but I'm not sure
about using that, and not ready to start on it.

Instead, laid some groundwork for [[transfer_control]] today. Added 
some simple commands to manage groups of repositories, and find files
that are present in repositories in a group. I'm not completely happy
with the syntax for that, and need to think up some good syntax to specify
files that are present in *all* repositories in a group.

The plan is to have the assistant automatically guess at groups to put new
repositories it makes in (it should be able to make good guesses),
as well as have an interface to change them, and an interface to configure
transfer control using these groups (and other ways of matching files).
And, probably, some canned transfer control recipes for common setups.

Collected up the past week's work and made a release today. I'm probably
back to making regular releases every week or two.
