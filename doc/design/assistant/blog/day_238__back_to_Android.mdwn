Back to really working toward an Android webapp now. I have been improving
the EvilSplicer, and the build machinery, and build environment all day.
Slow but steady progress.

First milestone of the day was when I got `yesod-form` to build with all
Template Haskell automatically expanded by the EvilSplicer. (With a few
manual fixups where it's buggy.)

At this point the Android build with the webapp enabled successfully
builds several files containing Yesod code.. And I suspect I am very close
to getting a first webapp build for Android.
