Pushed out a release today. Looking back over April, I'm happy with it as a
bug fix and stabilization month. Wish I'd finished the Android app in April,
but let's see what happens tomorrow.

Recorded part of a screencast on using Archive.org, but `recordmydesktop`
lost the second part. Grr. Will work on that later.
