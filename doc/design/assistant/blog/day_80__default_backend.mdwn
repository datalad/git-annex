I've changed the default backend used by git-annex from SHA256 to SHA256E.
Including the filename extension in the key is known to make repositories
more usable on things like MP3 players, and I've recently learned it also
avoids [[forum/Weird_behavior_with_OS_X_Finder_and_Preview.app]]. 

I thought about only changing the default in repositories set up by the
assistant, but it seemed simpler to change the main default. The old
backend is really only better if you might have multiple copies of files
with the same content that have different extensions.

Fixed the socket leak in pairing that eluded me earlier.

I've made a new [[polls]] page, and posted a poll:
[[polls/prioritizing_special_remotes]]
