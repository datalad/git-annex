More bugfixes today. The assistant now seems to have enough users that
they're turning up interesting bugs, which is good. But does keep me too
busy to add many more bugs\^Wcode.

The fun one today made it bloat to eat all memory when logging out of a
Linux desktop. I tracked that back to a bug in the Haskell DBUS library
when a session connection is open and the session goes away. Developed a
test case, and even profiled it, and sent it all of to the library's
author. Hopefully there will be a quick fix, in the meantime today's
release has DBUS turned off. Which is ok, it just makes it a little bit
slower to notice some events.
