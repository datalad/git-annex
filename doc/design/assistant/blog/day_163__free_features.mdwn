There was a typo in cabal file that broke building the assistant on OSX.
This didn't affect the autobuilds of the app, but several users building by
hand reported problems. I made a new minor release fixing that typo, and
also a resouce leak bug.

Got a restart UI working after all. It's a hack though. It
opens a new tab for the new assistant instance, and as most web browsers
don't allow javascript to close tabs, the old tab is left open. At some
point I need to add a proper thread manager to the assistant, which the
restart code could use to kill the watcher and committer threads, and then
I could do a clean restart, bringing up the new daemon and redirecting the
browser to it.

Found a bug in the assistant in direct mode -- the expensive transfer scan
didn't queue uploads needed to sync to other repos in direct mode, although
it did queue downloads. Fixing this laid some very useful groundwork for
making more commands support direct mode, too. Got stuck for a long time
dealing with some very strange `git-cat-file` behavior while making this
work. Ended up putting in a workaround.

After that, I found that these commands work in direct mode, without
needing any futher changes!

* `git annex find`
* `git annex whereis`
* `git annex copy`
* `git annex move`
* `git annex drop`
* `git annex log`

Enjoy! The only commands I'd like to add to this are `fsck`, `add`,
and `addurl`...
