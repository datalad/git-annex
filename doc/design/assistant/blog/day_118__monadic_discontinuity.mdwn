Spent most of the past day moving the assistant into a monad of its own
that encapsulates all the communications channels for its threads. This
involved modifiying nearly every line of code in the whole assistant.

Typical change:

[[!format haskell """
handleConnection threadname st dstatus scanremotes pushnotifier = do
        reconnectRemotes threadname st dstatus scanremotes (Just pushnotifier)
                =<< networkRemotes st

handleConnection = reconnectRemotes True =<< networkRemotes
"""]]

So, it's getting more readable..
