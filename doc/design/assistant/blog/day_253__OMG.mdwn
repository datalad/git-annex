[[!img /android/webapp.png alt="git-annex webapp on Android"]]

I fixed what I thought was keeping the webapp from working on Android, but
then it started segfaulting every time it was started. Eventually I
determined this segfault happened whenever haskell code called
`getaddrinfo`. I don't know why. This is particularly weird since I had
a demo web server that used `getaddrinfo` working way back in
[[day_201__real_Android_wrapup]]. Anyway, I worked around it by not using
`getaddrinfo` on Android.

Then I spent 3 hours stuck, because the webapp seemed to run, but
nothing could connect to the port it was on. Was it a firewall? Was
the Haskell threaded runtime's use of `accept()` broken? I went all the way
down to the raw system calls, and back, only to finally notice I had `netstat`
available on my Android. Which showed it was not listening to the port I
thought it was!

Seems that `ntohs` and `htons` are broken somehow. To get the
screenshot, I fixed up the port manually. Have a build running that
should work around the issue.

Anyway, the webapp works on Android!
