Worked on several important bug fixes today. One affects automatic merge
confict resolution, and can case data loss in direct mode, so I will be
making a release with the fix tomorrow.

Practiced TDD today, and good thing too. The new improved test suite
turned up a really subtle bug involving the git-annex branch vector
clocks-ish code, which I also fixed.

Also, fixes to the OSX autobuilds. One of them had a broken gpg, which is
now fixed. The other one is successfully building again. And, I'm switching
the Linux autobuilds to build against Debian stable, since testing has a
new version of libc now, which would make the autobuilds not work on older
systems. Getting an amd64 chroot into shape is needing rather a lot
of backporting of build dependencies, which I already did for i386.
