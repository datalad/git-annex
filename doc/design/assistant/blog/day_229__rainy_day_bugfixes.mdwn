Got caught up on bug reports and made some bug fixes.

The one bug I was really worried about, a strange file corruption problem
on Android, turned out not to be a bug in git-annex. (Nor is it a bug that
will affect regular users.)

The only interesting bug fixed was a mixed case hash directory name
collision when a repository is put on a VFAT filesystem (or other
filesystem with similar semantics). I was able to fix that nicely; since
such a repository will be in crippled filesystem mode due to other
limitations of the filesystem, and so won't be using symlinks,
it doesn't need to use the mixed case hash directory names.

Last night, finished up the repository removal code, and associated UI
tweaks. It works very well.

Will probably make a release tomorrow.
