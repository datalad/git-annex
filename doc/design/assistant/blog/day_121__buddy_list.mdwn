Got the XMPP client maintaining a list of buddies, including tracking which
clients are present and away, and which clients are recognised as other
git-annex assistant clients. This was fun, it is almost all pure
functional code, which always makes me happy.

Started building UI for XMPP pairing. So far, I have it showing a list of
buddies who are also running git-annex (or not). The list even refreshes
in real time as new buddies come online.
