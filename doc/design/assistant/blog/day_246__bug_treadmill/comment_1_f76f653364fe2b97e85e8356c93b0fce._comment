Perhaps if you made a bug report form that asked for the version number (with helpful command to get it printed below), and had a checkbox for \"full log attached\", etc. you might be able to weed out low-value bugs...  Not that adding UI to force good bugs really works, but there might be a couple of low-hanging fruit before the diminishing returns kick in.
