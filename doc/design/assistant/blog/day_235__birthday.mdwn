Felt like spending my birthday working on git-annex. Thanks again to
everyone who makes it possible for me to work on something I care about
every day.

Did some work on `git annex addurl` today. It had gotten broken in direct
mode (I think by an otherwise good and important bugfix). After fixing
that, I made it interoperate with the webapp. So if you have the webapp
open, it will display progress bars for downloads being run by `git annex
addurl`.

This enhancement meshes nicely with a FlashGot script Andy
contributed, which lets you queue up downloads into your annex from a web
browser. Andy described how to set it up in
[[this_tip|tips/Using_Git-annex_as_a_web_browsing_assistant]].

(I also looked briefly into ways to intercept a drag and drop of a link
into the webapp and make it lauch a download for you. It doesn't seem that
browsers allow javascript to override their standard behavior of loading
links that are dropped into them. Probably good to prevent misuse, but it
would be nice here...)

Also, I think I have fixed the progress bars displayed when downloading
a file from an encrypted remote. I did this by hooking up existing
download progress metering (that was only being used to display
a download percentage in the console) into the location log, so the
webapp can use it. So that was a *lot* easier than it could have been,
but still a pretty large patch (500+ lines). Haven't tested this; should work.
