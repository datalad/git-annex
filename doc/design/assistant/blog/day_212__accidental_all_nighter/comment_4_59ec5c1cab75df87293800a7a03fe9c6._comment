Build from source is too hard for a non-haskell developer, I run into various errors I can not resolve. The daily build gives me \"git-annex: error while loading shared libraries: libyaml-0.so.2: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory\". For Ubuntu a PPA with daily build would be handy.
