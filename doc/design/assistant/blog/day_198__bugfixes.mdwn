Wrote a C shim to get the Android app started. This avoids it relying on
the Android /system/bin/sh to run its shell script, or indeed relying on
any unix utilities from Android at all, which may help on some
systems. Pushed a new build of the Android app.

Tracked down a failure a lot of people are reporting with WebDAV support
to a backported security fix in the TLS library, and filed an upstream bug
about it.

Various other misc fixing and stuff.
My queue of bug reports and stuff only has 47 items in it now. Urk..
