See <http://kevinboone.net/android_nonroot.html> for info on where in the android filesystem you have write, exec ability.

Basically you have these abilities in `/data/local` from `adb shell` (and in debuggable app's folders using run-as with `adb shell`), and in `/data/data/<app_id>/` for each app (for example the terminal emulator's data dir when using the terminal emulator).

It might be possible to just have temporary root using an old exploit and writing up a bit of code to just setuid on the process and exec sh (source for nachoroot exploit <https://github.com/CunningLogic/NachoRoot>).

It *is* possible to install a distro without root using a chroot faker.

I am working here <https://sites.google.com/site/taldewandroid/> on a way to install the OpenWrt distro on Android. This is working on my phone already for quite a while! So far only sketchy notes are up, but more to come, G-d willing.
