I've tried with rsync and directory(real, mountpoint, and fuse mount), no S3. Same result on all of them.

Here is an strace -f http://pastebin.com/YqCbi7Ue

Funny thing is that now i hitting the failure on smaller files(<500kbyte).

I even did a restart because of that. To see if a clean boot would increate it back to the ~700kbyte, but it made no difference.

The annex hasn't been idle since last time, but i haven't done anything major in it. In total the annex is 204mb(up from 185mb at the time of my first post about this)
