Updated to the latest trunk, and did some more testing.

I'll retract the \"gpg being stupid\" comment. it just gives the normal \"(gpg)\".

There really isn't anything interesting in the stdout(but a lot of defunct git's in ps auxw), but i still can't get any files larger than ~710kbyte to transfer. They just stall.
