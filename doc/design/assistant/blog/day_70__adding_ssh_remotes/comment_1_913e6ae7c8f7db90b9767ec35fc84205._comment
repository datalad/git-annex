I've been playing around with the Assistant in the last few days.

And besides for gpg encryption it works great.

But whenever i set up a special remote(done it manually since you hadn't made this yet) it will break, bad.

Some files will transfer fine, but at some point it will still(the stdout from git-annex webapp shows gpg being stupid).

I get a huge amount of [git] <defunct> in my ps auxw. And two git-annex transferkey <key> --to host --file <some file>

It seems to consistently fall on a 9mb file i have. I have found no way to recover from this(killing and restarting git-annex will say 'transfer already in progress'. Deleting the file was to no avail, it still tries to transfer).

I have done a lot of testing and i've only seen this on special remotes when gpg encryption is enabled(i haven't tried encryption=shared)

Besides for this issue, the Assistant is looking great.
