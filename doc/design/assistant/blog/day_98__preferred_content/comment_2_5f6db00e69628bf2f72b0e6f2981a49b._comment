Yes, I think checking the future only for drops is both stable and equivilant to the other choices. 

Disregarding the target solves the problem for the current set of expressions. There may be future expressions or operations where that does not hold. For example, if move supported --auto (which it does not), you'd need to disregard both sides.

That method would make it impossible to do some possibly useful things. \"in=here or (not copies=3)\"

The real problem with it is that existing options like --copies and --in already take all repos into account, so this would potentally lead to two divergent DSLs being used by git-annex, which would probably be confusing.
