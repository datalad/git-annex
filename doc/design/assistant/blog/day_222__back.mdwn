Back from my trip. Spent today getting caught up.

Didn't do much while I was away. Pushed out a new release on Saturday.
Made `git annex` usage display nicer.

Fixed some minor webapp bugs today. The interesting bug was a
race that sometimes caused alerts or other notifications to be
missed and not be immediately displayed if they occurred while
a page was loading. You sometimes had to hit reload to see them,
but not anymore!

Checked if the `push.default=simple` change in upcoming git release will
affect git-annex. It shouldn't affect the assistant, or `git annex sync`,
since they always list all branches to push explicitly. But if you `git push`
manually, when the default changes that won't include the git-annex branch
in the push any longer.
