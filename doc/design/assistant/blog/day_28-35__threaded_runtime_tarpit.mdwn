I didn't plan to work on git-annex much while at DebConf, because the conference
always prevents the kind of concentration I need. But I unexpectedly also had to deal
with [three dead drives](http://joeyh.name/blog/entry/I_am_become_Joey_destroyer_of_drives/)
and illness this week. 

That said, I have been trying to debug a problem with git-annex and Haskell's threaded
runtime all week. It just hangs, randomly. No luck so far isolating why, although I now
have a branch that hangs fairly reliably, and in which I am trying to whittle the entire
git-annex code base (all 18 thousand lines!) into a nice test case.

This threaded runtime problem doesn't affect the assistant yet, but if I want to use
Yesod in developing the webapp, I'll need the threaded runtime, and using the threaded
runtime in the assistant generally would make it more responsive and less hacky.

Since this is a task I can work on without much concentration, I'll probably keep beating
on it until I return home. Then I need to spend some quality thinking time on where
to go next in the assistant.
