I got _a lot_ further with the latest upgrade.

* installation worked
* `git init` worked
* first `git annex init` asked to set user.{email,name}
* `git config --global ...` worked
* second `git annex init` segfaulted, but not immediately:

      init
        Detected a crippled filesystem.
      error: git-annex died of signal 11
