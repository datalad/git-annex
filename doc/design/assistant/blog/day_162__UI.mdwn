[Installed a generator](http://joeyh.name/blog/entry/overcast/),
so I'll have more power and less hibernation.

Added UI in the webapp to shut down the daemon. Would like to also have
restart UI, but that's rather harder to do, seems it'd need to start
another copy of the webapp (and so, of the assistant), and redirect the
browser to its new url. ... But running two assistants in the same repo at
the same time isn't good. Anyway, users can now use the UI to shut it down,
and then use their native desktop UI to start it back up.

Spiffed up the control menu. Had to stop listing other local repositories
in the menu, because there was no way to notice when a new one was added
(without checking a file on every page load, which is way overkill for this
minor feature). Instead added a new page that lists local repositories it
can switch to.
