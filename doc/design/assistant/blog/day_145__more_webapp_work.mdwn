One problem with the current configurators for remotes is they have a lot
of notes and text to read at the top. I've worked on cut that down somewhat,
mostly by adding links and help buttons next to fields in the form.

I also made each form have a check box controlling whether encryption is
enabled. Mostly as a way to declutter the text at the top, which always had
to say encryption is enabled.

I have a fairly well worked out design for [[desymlink]]. Will wait a few
days to work on it to let it jell.
