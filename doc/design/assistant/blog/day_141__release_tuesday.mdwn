I had planned to do nothing today; I can't remember the last time I did
that. Twas not to be; instead I had to make a new release to fix
a utterly stupid typo in the rsync special remote. I'm also seeing
some slightly encouraging signs of the OSX app being closer to working
and this release has a further fix toward that end; unsetting all the
environment variables before running the system's web browser.
