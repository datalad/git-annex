I, too, am running a dbus but like to hand mount my filesystems.  However, I'd imagine that I am both a minority and that my minority could like the extra control, so perhaps even a \"re-read the mtab /now/\" command that can be manually run after something is  manually mounted would suffice

Is it not possible to use inotify on the mtab?
