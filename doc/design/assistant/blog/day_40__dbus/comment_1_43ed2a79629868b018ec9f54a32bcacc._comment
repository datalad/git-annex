I am running KDE, dbus, and I like to mount drives by hand; all that without bothering to set up /etc/fstab... Often from CLI so I don't even see the notifications for new drives.

Especially while on the road, I will use no KDE, but just a tty or three. Still, dbus will be running.

Long story short, I would need polling for the assistant to work flawlessly in all use cases.
