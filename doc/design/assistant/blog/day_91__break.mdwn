Mostly took a break from working on the assistant today. Instead worked
on adding incremental fsck to git-annex. Well, that will be something
that assistant will use, eventually, probably.

Jimmy and I have been working on a self-contained OSX app for using the
assistant, that doesn't depend on installing git, etc. More on that
once we have something that works.
