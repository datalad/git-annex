Today was not a work day for me, but I did get a chance to install
git-annex in real life while visiting. Was happy to download the standalone
Linux tarball and see that it could be unpacked, and git-annex webapp
started just by clicking around in the GUI. And in very short order got it
set up.

I was especially pleased to see my laptop noticed this new repository
had appeared on the network via XMPP push, and started immediately
uploading files to my rsync.net transfer repository so the new
repository could get them.

Did notice that the standalone tarball neglected to install a
FDO menu file. Fixed that, and some other minor issues I noticed.


I also got a brief chance to try the Android webapp. It fails to start;
apparently `getaddrinfo` doesn't like the flags passed to it and is
failing. As failure modes go, this isn't at all bad. I can certainly work
around it with some hardcoded port numbers, but I want to fix it the right
way. Have ordered a replacement battery for my dead phone so I can use it
for Android testing.
