Just released git-annex 3.20120924, which includes beta versions of
the assistant and webapp. Read the [[/assistant/errata]], then give it a
try!

I've uploaded it to Haskell's cabal, and to Debian unstable, and hope my
helpers for other distributions will update them soon. (Although the
additional dependencies to build the webapp may take a while on some.)
I also hope something can be done to make a prebuilt version available on
OSX soonish.

I've decided to license the webapp under the
[AGPL](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.html). This should not impact
normal users of it, and git-annex can be built without the webapp as a pure
GPL licensed program. This is just insurance to prevent someone turning the
webapp into a propritary web-only service, by requiring that anyone who
does so provide the source of the webapp.
