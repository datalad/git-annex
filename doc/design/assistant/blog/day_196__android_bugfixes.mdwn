So it seems the Android app works pretty well on a variety of systems.
Only report of 100% failure so far is on Cyanogenmod 7.2 (Android 2.3.7).

Worked today on some of the obvious bugs.

* Turns out that getEnvironment is broken on Android, returning no
  environment, which explains the weird git behavior where it complains
  that it cannot determine the username and email (because it sees no USER
  or HOST), and suggests setting them in the global git config (which it
  ignores, because it sees no HOME). Put in a work around for this
  that makes `git annex init` more pleasant, and opened a bug report on
  ghc-android.
* Made the Android app detect when it's been upgraded, and re-link all
  the commands, etc.
* Fixed the bug that made `git-annex assistant` on Android re-add all
  existing files on startup.
* Enabled a few useful things in busybox. Including vi.
* Replaced the service notification icon with one with the git-annex logo.
* Made the terminal not close immediately when the shell exits, which
  should aid in debugging of certain types of crashes.

I want to set up an autobuilder for Android, but to do that I need to
install all the haskell libraries on my server. Since getting them built
for Android involved several days of hacking the first time, this will
be an opportunity to make sure I can replicate that. Hopefully in less time.
