Released the first git-annex with direct mode today. Notably, the assistant
enables direct mode in repositories it creates. All builds are updated to
3.20130102 now.

My plan for this month is to fix whatever things currently might be
preventing you from using the git-annex assistant. So bugfixes and
whatever other important gaps need to be filled, but no major new
feature developments.
