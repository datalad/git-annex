Created a backport of the latest git-annex release for Debian 7.0 wheezy.
Needed to backport a dozen haskell dependencies, but not too bad.
This will be available in the backports repository once Debian
starts accepting new packages again. I plan to keep the backport up-to-date
as I make new releases.

The cheap Android tablet I bought to do this last Android push with came
pre-rooted from the factory. This may be why I have not seen this bug:
[[bugs/Android_app_permission_denial_on_startup]]. If you have Android
4.2.2 or a similar version, your testing would be helpful for me to know if
this is a widespread problem. I have an idea about a way to work around the
problem, but it involves writing Java code, and probably polling a file,
ugh.

Got S3 support to build for Android. Probably fails to work 
due to the same network stack problems affecting WebDAV and Jabber.

Got removable media mount detection working on Android. Bionic has an
amusing stub for `getmntent` that prints out "FIX ME! implement
getmntent()". But, `/proc/mounts` is there, so I just parse it.
Also enabled the app's `WRITE_MEDIA_STORAGE` permission to allow
access to removable media. However, this didn't seem to do anything. :(

Several fixes to make the Android webapp be able to set up repositories on
remote ssh servers. However, it fails at the last hurdle with what
looks like a `git-annex-shell` communication problem. Almost there..
