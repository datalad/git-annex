Got the release out, with rather a lot of fiddling to fix broken builds on
various platforms.

Also released a backport to Debian stable. This backport has the assistant,
although without WebDAV support. Unfortunately it's an old version from
May, since ghc transitions and issues have kept newer versions out of
testing so far. Hope that will clear up soon (probably by dropping haskell
support for s390x), and I can update it to a newer version. 
If nothing else it allows using direct mode with Debian stable.

Pleased that the git-cat-files bug was quickly fixed by Peff and has
already been pulled into Junio's release tree!

----

This evening, I've added an interface around the new improved 
`git check-ignore` in git 1.8.4. The assistant can finally honor `.gitignore`
files!
