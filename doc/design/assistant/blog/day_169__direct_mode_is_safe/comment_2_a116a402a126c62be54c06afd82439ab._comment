Maybe Ubuntu users would be satisfied with tweaks to their sources.list and preferences?

/etc/apt/sources.list.d/git-annex.sources.list
deb http://ftp.us.debian.org/debian unstable main

/etc/apt/preferences.d/git-annex.preferences
Package: *
Pin: release a=unstable,o=Debian
Pin-Priority: 400


Not sure how that will work out in Ubuntu package manager.  In aptitude you'll get warning about untrusted repos (maybe install Debian's gpg keys) and will probably have to manually select dependencies from Debian repos.
