Yesterday, I woke up and realized I didn't know what I needed to work on in
git-annex. Added a poll, [[polls/Android]] to help me decide what major
thing to work on next.

More flailing at the OSX monster. (A species of gelatinous cube?)
Current fun seems to involve git processes spinning if git-annex
was started without a controlling TTY. I'm befuddled by this.

Made the S3 and Glacier configurators have a list of regions, rather than
requiring a the region's code be entered correctly. I could not find a list of
regions, or better, an API to get a list, so I'll have to keep updating as
Amazon adds services in new regions.

Spent some time trying to get WebDAV to work with livedrive.com.
It doesn't like empty PROPPATCH. I've developed a change to the haskell DAV
library that will let me avoid this problem.
