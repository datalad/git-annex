This seems a very auspicious day to have finally gotten the Android app
doing something useful! I've fixed the last bugs with using it to set up a
remote ssh server, which is all I need to make my Android tablet
sync photos I take with a repository on my laptop.

I set this up entirely in the GUI, except for needing to switch to the
terminal twice to enter my laptop's password.

How fast is it? Even several minute long videos transfer before I can
switch from the camera app to the webapp. To get this screenshot with it in
the process of syncing, I had to take a dozen pictures in a minute. Nice
problem to have. ;)

Have fun trying this out for yourself after tonight's autobuilds. But a
warning: One of the bugs I fixed today had to be fixed in `git-annex-shell`,
as run on the ssh server that the Android connects to. So the Android app
will only work with ssh servers running a new enough version of git-annex.

Worked on geting git-annex into Debian testing, which is needed before
the wheezy backport can go in. Think I've worked around most of the issues
that were keeping it from building on various architectures.

Caught up on some bug reports and fixed some of them.
