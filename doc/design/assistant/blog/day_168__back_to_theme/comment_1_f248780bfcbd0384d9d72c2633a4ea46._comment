I suggest using the term \"repository\" not \"remote\". Two reasons: 1: it's a noun in *English. 2: it works for both local and remote repositories.

Both get +1 because they match git terminology. (I have a secret dream that the assistant might bring people to git, maybe that's silly.)

\* OK, so \"remote\" is also a noun in English, but it means the widget with buttons that controls the tv/whatever.
