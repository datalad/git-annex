It's great that you are addressing the management of older versions. I am new to git-annex but couldn't find much information about this topic. Is it also possible to make git-annex show you the history of files (with date, size, ...) and where (which repositories) they are stored? Or to retrieve a specific version from a remote repository?

Thanks for this amazing peace of software!
