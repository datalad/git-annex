Excellent stuff!  Another thing I'd like to see is that I find myself doing the following all the time:

    git annex copy --to titan --not --in titan

Meaning: copy everything to titan that it doesn't already have.  This operation is very quick.  But I write just:

    git annex copy --to titan

This operation is extremely slow, since it appears to scan through every file in the repository.  Is there a way to have the latter imply the former?  I wouldn't ever want to copy a file that it already has anyway...
