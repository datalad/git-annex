It's done! The assistant branch is merged into master.

Updated the [[assistant]] page with some screenshots and instructions for
using it.

Made some cosmetic fixes to the webapp.

Fixed the transferrer to use `~/.config/git-annex/program`
to find the path to git-annex when running it. (There are ways to find the
path of the currently running program in unux, but they all suck, so I'm
avoiding them this way.)

Read some OSX launchd documentation, and it seems it'd be pretty easy to
get the assistant to autostart on login on OSX. If someone would like to
test launchd files for me, get in touch.
