No release today after all. Unexpected bandwidth failure. Maybe in a few
days..

Got unannex and uninit working in direct mode. This is one of the more
subtle parts of git-annex, and took some doing to get it right.
Surprisingly, unannex in direct mode actually turns out to be faster than
in indirect mode. In direct mode it doesn't have to immediately commit the
unannexing, it can just stage it to be committed later.

Also worked on the ssh connection caching code. The perrennial problem with
that code is that the fifo used to communicate with ssh has a small limit
on its path, somewhere around 100 characters. This had caused problems when
the hostname was rather long. I found a way to avoid needing to be able to
reverse back from the fifo name to the hostname, and this let me take the
md5sum of long hostnames, and use that shorter string for the fifo.

Also various other bug followups.
