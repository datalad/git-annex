Hey, thanks for working on this.

I tried the Feb 21 apk on my Samsung galaxy Tab 10.1 with Android 4.0.4. It installed and launched fine, bringing up a terminal window, keyboard, etc, but only the return key works. It's not possible to type znything. The menus, new window button etc all seem to be functional.
