Seems to run fine. I managed to create a repository, git-annex init it (had to set email and name per repository). 

The first time I tried git-annex init it said \"Detected a crippled file system.\" \"Enabling direct mode.\" The final try that actually worked only mentioned the crippled filesystem and not direct mode.
