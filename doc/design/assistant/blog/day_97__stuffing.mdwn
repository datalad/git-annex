Not a lot of programming today; I spent most of the day stuffing hundreds
of envelopes for this Kickstarter thing you may have heard of. Some post
office is going to be very surprised with all the international mail soon.

That said, I did write 184 lines of code. (Actually rather a lot, but it
was mostly pure functional code, so easy to write.) That
pops up your text editor on a file with the the trust and group
configurations of repositories, that's stored in the git-annex branch.
Handy for both viewing that stuff all in one place, and changing it.

The real reason for doing that is to provide a nice interface for editing
transfer control expressions, which I'll be adding next.
