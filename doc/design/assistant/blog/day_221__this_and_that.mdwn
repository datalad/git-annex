Was unsure yesterday if my transferrer pools code would just work, or
would be horribly broken and need a lot of work to get going. It was a
complex change involving both high-level STM code and low-level pipes and
fds. Well, it almost worked 100% first time, I just had a minor issue in
my fd setup to fix. Everything else seems to work perfectly.
Very happy how that went!

----

Improved support and documentation for using the OSX app and Linux
standalone tarball at the command line. Now it's sufficient to just put
their directory into `PATH`, rather than using `runshell`.

----

The webapp's form for adding a removable drive now allows specifying the
directory to use within the drive (default "annex").

When the drive's repository already exists, and it's not a repository
that git-annex knows about, it confirms that the user wants
to combine its contents into their repository.


(Should probably implement this same check when adding a ssh remote.)

Off to Boston!
