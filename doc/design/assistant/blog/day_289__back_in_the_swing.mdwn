Came up with a fix for the gnucash hard linked file problem that makes the
assistant notice the files gnucash writes. This is not full hard link support;
hard linked files still don't cleanly sync around. But new hard links to
files are noticed and added, which is enough to support gnucash.

Spent around 4 hours on reproducing and trying to debug
[[bugs/Hanging_on_install_on_Mountain_lion]]. It seems that recent upgrades
of the OSX build machine led to this problem. And indeed, building with an
older version of Yesod and Warp seems to have worked around the problem. So
I updated the OSX build for the last release. I will have to re-install the
new Yesod on my laptop and investigate further -- is this an OSX specific
problem, or does it affect Linux? Urgh, this is the second hang I've
encountered involving Warp..

Got several nice [[success stories|day_288__success_stories]], but I don't
think I've seen *yours* yet. ;) Please post!
