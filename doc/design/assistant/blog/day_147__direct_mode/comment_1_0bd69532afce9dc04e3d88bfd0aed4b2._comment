I don't understand the difference behind:

> Removing objects also works (and puts back a broken symlink)

and

> \"drop\" won't work because they rely on the symlink to map back to the key.

If a file is removed (its content, which is replaced by a symlink), then it's not present there, so effectively it should be counted as \"dropped\" at this place. So, removing a file without counting it as dropped is something inconsistent, isn't it? Do I misunderstand something?
