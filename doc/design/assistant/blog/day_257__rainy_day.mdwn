Put in a fix for `getprotobyname` apparently not returning anything for
"tcp" on Android. This might fix all the special remotes there, but I don't
know yet, because I have to rebuild a lot of Haskell libraries to try it.

So, I spent most of today writing a script to build all the Haskell
libraries for Android from scratch, with all my patches.
