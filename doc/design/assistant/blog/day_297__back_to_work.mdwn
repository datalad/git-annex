It looks like I'm funded for at least the next 9 months! It would still be
nice to get to a year. ;) <https://campaign.joeyh.name/>

Working to get caught up on recent bug reports..

Made `git annex uninit` not nuke anything that's left over in
`.git/annex/objects` after unannexing all the files. After all, that could
be important old versions of files or deleted file, and just because the
user wants to stop using git-annex, doesn't mean git-annex shouldn't try to
protect that data with its dying breath. So it prints out some suggestions
in this case, and leaves it up to the user to decide what to do with the
data.

Fixed the Android autobuilder, which had stopped including the webapp.

Looks like another autobuilder will be needed for OSX 10.9.
