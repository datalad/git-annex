Short day today, but I again worked only on progress bars.

* Added upload progress tracking for the directory special remote.
* Some optimisations.
* Added a `git annex-shell transferkey` command. This isn't used yet,
  but the plan is to use it to feed back information about how much
  of a file has been sent when downloading it. So that the uploader
  can display a progress bar. This method avoids needing to parse the rsync
  protocol, which is approximately impossible without copying half of rsync.
  Happily, git-annex's automatic ssh connection caching will make the small
  amount of data this needs to send be efficiently pipelined over the same
  ssh connection that rsync is using.

I probably have less than 10 lines of code to write to finish up
[[progressbars]] for now. Looking forward to getting that behind me, and on
to something more interesting. Even doing mail merge to print labels to
mail out Kickstarter rewards is more interesting than progress bars at this
point. :)
