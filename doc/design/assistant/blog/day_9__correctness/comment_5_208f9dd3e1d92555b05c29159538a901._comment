@wichert All this inotify stuff is entirely linux specific AFAIK anyway, so it's find for workarounds to limitations in inotify functionality to also be linux specific.

@dieter I think you're thinking of hard links, filesystems don't track number of open file handles afaik.

@Jimmy, I'm planning to get watch going on freebsd (and hopefully that will also cover OSX), after merging it :)

@Richard, the file is set RO while it's being annexed, so any lsof would come after that point.
