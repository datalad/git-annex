I hadn't tried it, but it looks like a very good idea. I will have to change my protocol a little bit as I currently sometimes send chat messages not directed to a specific client, in order to reach any clients using an account. To reach clients with a negative priority, chat messages have to be directed at the client.

Ok, done; priority is set to -1 and all the XMPP messaging in git-annex still seems to work!

I don't know though, that this entirely solves the problem. In particular, a regular xmpp client may decide to direct a chat message at a git-annex client, due to that being the only client connected. If this does become a problem, I suppose git-annex could buffer and re-send such messages when it sees a regular client connect. Or it could show them in the webapp, but that seems feature creep.
