I've reworked the UI of the webapp's dashboard. Now the repository list is
included, above the transfers. I found I was spending a lot of time
switching between the dashboard and repository list, so might as well
combine them into a single screen. Yesod's type safe urls and widgets
made this quite easy to do, despite it being a thousand line commit.
Liking the result ... Even though it does make all my screencasts dated.

Rest of my time was spent on XMPP pairing UI. Using the same pages for both
pairing with a friend and for self-pairing was confusing, so now the two
options are split.

Now every time an XMPP git push is received or sent, it checks if there's
a cloud repository configured, which is needed to send the contents of
files. If not, it'll display this alert. Hopefully this
will be enough to get users fully set up.

At this point I'm finally happy enough with the XMPP pairing + cloud
repository setup process to film a screencast of it. As soon as I have
some time & bandwidth someplace quiet. Expect one by the end of the month.
