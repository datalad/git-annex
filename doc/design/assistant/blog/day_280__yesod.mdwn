Today marks 1 year since I started working on the git-annex assistant. 280
solid days of work!

As a background task here at the beach I've been porting git-annex to yesod
1.2. Finished it today, earlier than expected, and also managed to keep it
building with older versions. Some tricks kept the number of
ifdefs reasonably low.
