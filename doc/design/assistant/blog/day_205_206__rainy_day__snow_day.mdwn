Yesterday was all bug fixes, nothing to write about really.

Today I've been working on getting XMPP remotes to sync more reliably.
I left some big holes when I stopped work on it in November:

1. The assistant did not sync with XMPP remotes when it started up.
2. .. Or when it detected a network reconnection.
3. There was no way to trigger a full scan for transfers
   after receiving a push from an XMPP remote.

The asynchronous nature of git push over XMPP complicated doing this, but
I've solved all 3 issues today.
