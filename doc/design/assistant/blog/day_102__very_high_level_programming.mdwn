## today

Came up with four groups of repositories that it makes sense to
define standard preferred content expressions for.

[[!format haskell """
	preferredContent :: StandardGroup -> String
	preferredContent ClientGroup = "exclude=*/archive/*"
	preferredContent TransferGroup = "not inallgroup=client and " ++ preferredContent ClientGroup
	preferredContent ArchiveGroup = "not copies=archive:1"
	preferredContent BackupGroup = "" -- all content is preferred
"""]]

[[preferred_content]] has the details about these groups, but
as I was writing those three preferred content expressions,
I realized they are some of the highest level programming I've ever done,
in a way.

Anyway, these make for a very simple repository configuration UI:

## yesterday (forgot to post this)

Got the assistant honoring preferred content settings. Although so far that
only determines what it transfers. Additional work will be needed to make
content be dropped when it stops being preferred.

----

Added a "configure" link next to each repository on the repository config
page. This will go to a form to allow setting things like repository
descriptions, groups, and preferred content settings.

----

Cut a release.
