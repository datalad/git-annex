Two releases of the Haskell DAV library today. First release had my changes
from yesterday. Then I realized I'd also need support for making WebDAV
"collections" (subdirectories), and sent Clint a patch for that too, as
well as a patch for querying DAV properties, and that was 0.2.
Got it into Debian unstable as well. Should have everything I'll need now.

The webdav special remote is now working! Still todo:
Encryption support, progress bars, large file chunking, and webapp
configurators. But already, it's a lot nicer than the old approach of using
davfs2, which was really flakey and slow with large data volumes.

I did notice, though, that uploading a 100 mb file made the process use 100
mb of memory. This is a problem I've struggled with earlier with S3, the
Haskell http libraries are prevented from streaming data by several parts
of the protocol that cause the data to be accessed more than once. I guess
this won't be a problem for DAV though, since it'll probably be chunking
files anyway.

Mailed out all my Kickstarter USB key rewards, and ordered
the T-shirts too.
