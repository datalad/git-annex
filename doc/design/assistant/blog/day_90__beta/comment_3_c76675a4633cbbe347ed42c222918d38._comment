Cabal update

Cabal install git-annex 
Seemed to install correctly on OS X 10.7

After the installation, an application for git-annex showed up on my desktop.  This is the wrong place to put applications in OS X.  It should belong in the /Applications Folder.  
Launching the git-annex app, the web-browser is opened, and it tells me to make a repository.  I entered /Users/[my home folder]/Annex and continued.  I then got an internal server error and nothing else happened.  The Error:

uuid [\"-m\"] exited 127

Annex was created, and there is a .git folder in it.

Checking the annex status:
Bret-Air:Annex bret$ git annex status
git-annex: First run: git-annex init

I'll try it on 10.6 here in just a moment.  Let me know if I can provide any more useful information.
