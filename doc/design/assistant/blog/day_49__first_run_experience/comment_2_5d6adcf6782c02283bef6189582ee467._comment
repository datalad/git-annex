Hmm, my thought on putting it under Desktop is that'll let me install git-annex and tell my mom (really!) that files dragged to there are shared. Don't the other xdg directories get used as default save/open locations for things like word processors, so not need to be on the desktop?

Although that may not be necessary. I've realized I can, at least on linux, easily make a button on the webapp that pops open the directory in the desktop's file manager.

I guess another way of looking at the question is: Where does dropbox put its folder?
