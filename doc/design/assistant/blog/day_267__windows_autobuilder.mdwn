git-annex is now autobuilt for Windows on the same Jenkins farm that
builds msysgit. Thanks for Yury V. Zaytsev for providing that! Spent about
half of today setting up the build.

Got the test suite to pass in direct mode, and indeed in direct mode
on a FAT file system. Had to fix one corner case in direct mode `git annex
add`. Unfortunately it still doesn't work on Android; somehow `git clone` 
of a local repository is broken there. Also got the test suite to build,
and run on Windows, though it fails pretty miserably.
