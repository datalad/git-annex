I *think* I've managed to fully track down the [[webapp_hang]]. It is,
apparently, a bug in the Warp web server's code intended to protect against
the [Slowloris](http://ha.ckers.org/slowloris/) attack. It assumes,
incorrectly, that a web browser won't reuse a connection it's left idle for
30 seconds. Some bad error handling keeps a connection open with no thread
to service it, leading to the hang.
<https://github.com/yesodweb/wai/issues/146>

Have put a 30 minute timeout into place as a workaround, and, unless
a web browser sits on an idle connection for a full 30 minutes and then
tries to reuse it, this should be sufficient.

I was chasing that bug, quietly, for 6 months. Would see it now and
then, but not be able to reproduce it or get anywhere with analysis.
I had nearly given up. If you enjoy stories like that, read Ellen
Ullman's excellent book The Bug.
