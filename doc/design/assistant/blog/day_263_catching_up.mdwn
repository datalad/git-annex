Spent some time today to get caught up on bug reports and website traffic.
Fixed a few things.

Did end up working on Windows for a while too. I got `git annex drop`
working. But nothing that moves content quite works yet..

I've run into a stumbling block with `rsync`. It thinks that
`C:\repo` is a path on a ssh server named "C". Seems I will need to translate
native windows paths to unix-style paths when running rsync.
