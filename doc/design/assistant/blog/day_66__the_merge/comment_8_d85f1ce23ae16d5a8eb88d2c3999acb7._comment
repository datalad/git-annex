That got rid of that error. However now I get the following at the last step:

Linking dist/build/git-annex/git-annex ...
Installing executable(s) in /home/kev/bin
setup: git-annex.1: does not exist
cabal: Error: some packages failed to install:
git-annex-3.20120826 failed during the final install step. The exception was:
ExitFailure 1

There doesn't seem to be any failures further up the output just some warnings. All the other steps complete fine
Thanks for any advice/pointers here
-Kevin
