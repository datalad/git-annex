It's hard to tell from that error message what's going on. I'd hope that there was actually a real error message printed earlier than that that.

For now, I can only guess.. In order to install the haskell libxml-sax library, you need to have the GNOME XML2 library installed, including development headers. On Debian and derivatives, that is `apt-get install libxml2-dev`. 

Alternatively, you can disable use of dbus by passing this to your cabal install: `--flags=-Dbus`
