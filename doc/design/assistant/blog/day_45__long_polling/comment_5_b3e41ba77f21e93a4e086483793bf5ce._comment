After poking through git-annex, I had the same realization. I hadn't realized that Yesod (or perhaps more accurately, Warp) is asynchronous above the Application level. I had feared I'd need to write some WAI middleware to accommodate the blocking nature of long polling requests. In retrospect it seems kind of silly: what kind of high-performance webserver doesn't handle requests concurrently?

I do still think there's a pattern worth encapsulating, even if it won't be long until WebSockets and SSE are widespread enough to be developed against without fallbacks.
