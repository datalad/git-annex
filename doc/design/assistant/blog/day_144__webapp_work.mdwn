Made the webapp show runtime errors on a prettified page that includes version
info, a bug reporting link, etc.

Dealt with a bad interaction between required fields and the bootstrap modals
displayed when submitting some configuration forms. This was long, complex,
and had lots of blind alleys. In the end, I had to derive new password and
text fields in yesod that don't set the required attribute in the generated
html.
