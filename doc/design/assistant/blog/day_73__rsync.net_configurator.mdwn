Now finished building a special configurator for rsync.net. While
this is just a rsync remote to git-annex, there are some tricky bits to
setting up the ssh key using rsync.net's restricted shell. The configurator
automates that nicely. It took about 3 hours of work, and 49 lines of
rsync.net specific code to build this.

Thanks to rsync.net who heard of my Kickstarter and gave me a really
nice free lifetime account. BTW guys, I wish your restricted shell
supported '&&' in between commands, and returned a nonzero exit status when
the command fails. This would make my error handling work better.

I've also reworked the repository management page. Nice to see those
configurators start to fill in!
