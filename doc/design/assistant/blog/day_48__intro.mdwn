Lots of WebApp UI improvements, mostly around the behavior when
displaying alert messages. Trying to make the alerts informative
without being intrusively annoying, think I've mostly succeeded now.

Also, added an intro display. Shown is the display with only one repo;
if there are more repos it also lists them all.
