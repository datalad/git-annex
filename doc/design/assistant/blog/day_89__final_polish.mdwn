Finally wrapped up progress bars; upload progress is now reported in all
situations. 

After all that, I was pleased to find a use for the progress info, beyond
displaying it to the user. Now the assistant uses it to decide whether it
makes sense to immediately retry a failed transfer. This should make it
work nicely, or at least better, with flaky network or drives.

The webapp crashed on startup when there was no `~/.gitconfig`.
Guess all of us who have tried it so far are actual git users,
but I'm glad I caught this before releasing the beta.

Jimmy Tang kindly took on making a OS X .app directory for git-annex.
So it now has an icon that will launch the webapp.

I'm getting lots of contributors to git-annex all of a sudden. I've had 3
patches this weekend, and 2 of them have been to Haskell code.
Justin Azoff is working on [[todo/incremental_fsck]], and Robie Basak
has [gotten Amazon Glacier working](https://github.com/basak/glacier-cli)
using the hook special remote.

Started doing some design for [[transfer_control]]. I will start
work on this after releasing the first beta.
