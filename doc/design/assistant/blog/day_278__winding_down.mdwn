Winding down work for now, as I prepare for a week at the beach starting in
2 days. That will be followed by a talk about git-annex at
[SELF2013](http://www.southeastlinuxfest.org/) in Charlotte NC on June 9th.

Bits & pieces today.

Want to get a release out RSN, but I'm waiting for the previous release
to finally reach Debian testing, which should happen on Saturday. Luckily I
hear the beach house has wifi, so I will probably end up cutting the
release from there. Only other thing I might work on next week is updating
to yesod 1.2.
