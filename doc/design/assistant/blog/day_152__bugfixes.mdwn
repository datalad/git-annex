Fixed a bug in the kqueue code that made the assistant not notice when a
file was renamed into a subdirectory. This turned out to be because the
symlink got broken, and it was using `stat` on the file. Switching to
`lstat` fixed that.

Improved installation of programs into standalone bundles. Now it uses
the programs detected by configure, rather than a separate hardcoded list.
Also improved handling of lsof, which is not always in PATH.

Made a OSX 10.8.2 build of the app, which is nearly my last gasp attempt
at finding a way around this crazy `git init` spinning problem with Jimmy's
daily builds are used with newer OSX versions. Try it here:

Mailed out the Kickstarter T-shirt rewards today, to people in the US.
Have to fill out a bunch of forms before I can mail the non-US ones.
