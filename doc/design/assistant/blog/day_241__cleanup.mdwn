Finished the last EvilSplicer tweak and other fixes to make the 
Android webapp build without any hand-holding.

Currently setting up the Android autobuilder to include the webapp in its
builds. To make this work I had to set up a new chroot with all the right
stuff installed.

Investigated how to make the Android webapp open a web browser when run.
As far as I can tell (without access to an Android device right now), 
`am start -a android.intent.action.VIEW -d http://localhost/etc` should do
it.

Seems that git 1.8.2 broke the assistant. I've put in a fix but have not
yet tested it.
