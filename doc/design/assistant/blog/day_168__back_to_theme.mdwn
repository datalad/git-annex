This month's theme is supposed to be fixing up whatever might prevent users
from using the assistant. To that end, I've posted an open-ended poll,
[[polls/what is preventing me from using git-annex assistant]]. Please go
fill it out so I can get an idea of how many people are using the
assistant, and what needs to be done to get the rest of you, and your
friends and family able to use it.

In the meantime, today I fixed several bugs that were recently reported in
the webapp and assistant. Getting it working as widely as possible, even on
strange IPv6 only systems, and with browsers that didn't like my generated
javascript code is important, and fits right into this month's theme. I'm
happy to see lots of bugs being filed, since it means more users are trying
the assistant out.

Also continued work on making direct mode transfers safe. All transfers to
local git remotes (wish I had a better phrase!) are now safe in direct mode.
Only uploading from a direct mode repository over ssh to another git
repository is still potentially unsafe.
