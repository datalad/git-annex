Got the webapp's progress bars updating for downloads. Updated
[[progressbars]] with all the options for ways to get progress info. For
downloads, it currently uses the easy, and not very expensive, approach of
periodically polling the sizes of files that are being downloaded.

For uploads, something more sophisticated will be called for..

The webapp really feels alive now that it has progress bars!
