You can do this in css:

    word-wrap: break-word;

That should make the text not leave the box. Not sure if this makes it break \"reasonably\" though, eg a two letter word followed by an 200 letter \"word\" would probably leave the two letter word on a line by itself.

Worth a try though.

Seems to be well supported on browsers: [http://caniuse.com/#search=wrap](http://caniuse.com/#search=wrap)
