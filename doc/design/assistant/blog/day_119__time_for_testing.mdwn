Finished working the new assistant monad into all the assistant's code.
I've changed 1870 lines of code in the past two days. It feels like more.
While the total number of lines of code has gone up by around 100, the
actual code size has gone *down*; the monad allowed dropping 3.4 kilobytes
of manual variable threading complications. Or around 1% of a novel edited
away, in other words.

I don't seem to have broken anything, but I'm started an extensive test
of all the assistant and webapp. So far, the bugs I've found were not
introduced by my monadic changes. Fixed several bugs around adding
removable drives, and a few other minor bugs. Plan to continue testing
tomorrow.
