Short day today.

* Worked on fixing a number of build failures people reported.
* Solved the problem that was making transfer pause/resume not always work.
  Although there is another bug where pausing a transfer sometimes lets
  another queued transfer start running. 
* Worked on getting the assistant to start on login on OSX.
