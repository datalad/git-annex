Yes, setting that, or just clicking to pause syncing to a remote in the webapp will still work.

Although I don't think you need to.. If the remote is on a filesystem mount point, the assistant will just ignore it when it's not mounted. And will automatically detect when it gets mounted and sync with it, too. Same as USB drives are handled.
