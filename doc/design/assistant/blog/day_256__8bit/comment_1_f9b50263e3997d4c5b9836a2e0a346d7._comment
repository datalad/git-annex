that's amazing.  I saw in one of the conference videos that you said you didn't use dropbox, and I wanted to let you know (in case you were curious) that this is one of the features that they have on their android app, that pictures and videos are uploaded to one's dropbox.  Two questions, is there a toggle or option somewhere to upload over wifi only? and did you set up the tablet's camera folder as a source directory?
