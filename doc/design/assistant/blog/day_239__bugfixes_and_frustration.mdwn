Several bug fixes today, and got mostly caught up on recent messages.
Still have a backlog of two known bugs that I cannot reproduce well enough
to have worked on, but I am thinking I will make a release tomorrow. There
have been a lot of changes in the 10 days since the last release.

I am, frustratingly, stuck building the webapp on Android with no forward
progress today (and last night) after such a productive day yesterday.

The expanded Template Haskell code of the webapp fails to compile,
whereever type safe urls are used.

<pre>
Assistant/WebApp/Types.hs:95:63:
    Couldn't match expected type `Route WebApp -> t2'
                with actual type `Text'
    The function `urender_a1qcK' is applied to three arguments,
    but its type `Route WebApp -> [(Text, Text)] -> Text' has only two
    In the expression: urender_a1qcK u_a1qcL [] LogR
    In the first argument of `toHtml', namely
      `(\ u_a1qcL -> urender_a1qcK u_a1qcL [] LogR)'
</pre>

My best guess is this is a mismatch between the versions of yesod (or other
libraries) used for the native and cross compiled ghc's. So I've been
slowly trying to get a fully matched set of versions in between working on
bugs.
