How do you prefer bugs to be reported?

I'm having a problem where git-annex (from git, 1e41c0d85ecc24e8656bff79b2fba46c3663a054) is taking over 20GB of RAM after adding a single file.

To reproduce:

1. Create a new annex (I used the web app, created an annex at ~/annex)
2. Add box.com as a remote, using encryption (followed <http://git-annex.branchable.com/tips/using_box.com_as_a_special_remote/>, basically `cd ~/annex; git annex initremote box.com type=directory directory=/media/box.com encryption=$GPGID`)
3. copied a file into the annex (ok, I admit, the file was a bit large, 350MB, but still)
4. refreshed the web app, nothing happened
5. closed the web app
6. started git annex assistant inside ~/annex
7. git annex webapp
8. noted that git annex noticed the file, and started transferring
9. wait
10. memory usage for the git-annex process goes beyond 21GB RAM
11. oomkiller kills git-annex
