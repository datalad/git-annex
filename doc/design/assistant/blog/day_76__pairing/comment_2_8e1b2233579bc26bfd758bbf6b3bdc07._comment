The [[bugs]] page is the place to put bug reports like this so I won't forget them.

This should certainly not be happening. There are actually two git-annex processes running in the situation you describe; I'd be most curious to know whether the `git annex transfer` process was the one that blew up, or if the `git annex assistant` blew up. Also, it's not clear to me if you enabled the chunksize parameter when setting up the special remote, which could well be a significant detail.
