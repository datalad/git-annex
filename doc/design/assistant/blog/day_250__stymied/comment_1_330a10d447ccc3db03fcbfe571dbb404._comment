I was not looking forward to figuring out how to come up with all of those haskell build deps on Precise, so thanks to Fran√ßois Marier for putting this together.  (Does Ubuntu/launchpad autobuild all of the architectures, or do they need to be contributed? I see that `armhf` isn't there at the moment...)
