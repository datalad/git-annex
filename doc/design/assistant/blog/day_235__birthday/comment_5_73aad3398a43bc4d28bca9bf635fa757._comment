For whatever reason, dragging links onto the page text in the \"Using drag and drop for selecting\" section of <http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/file/dndfiles/#toc-selecting-files-dnd> does not trigger the usual page change. I don't really know why--I couldn't get it to work on my own with Firebug. And thanks for git-annex--love it!
