Wow, 11 days off! I was busy with first dentistry and then DebConf.

Yesterday I [visited CERN](http://joeyh.name/blog/entry/words_fail_me/) and
got to talk with some of their IT guys about how they manage their tens of
petabytes of data. Interested to hear they also have the equivilant of a
per-subdirectory annex.numcopies setting. OTOH, they have half a billion
more files than git's index file is likely to be able to scale to support. ;)

Pushed a release out today despite not having many queued changes. 
Also, I got git-annex migrated to Debian testing, and so was also
able to update the wheezy backport to a just 2 week old version.

Today is also the last day of the [campaign](https://campaign.joeyh.name/)!

----

There has been a ton of discussion about git-annex here at DebConf,
including 3 BoF sessions that mostly focused on it, among other git stuff.
Also, RichiH will be presenting his
"[Gitify Your Life](http://penta.debconf.org/dc13_schedule/events/1025.en.html)"
talk on Friday; you can catch it on the [live stream](http://blog.debconf.org/blog/2013/08/14#hl_dc13_recordings).

I've also had a continual stream of in-person bug and feature requests.
(Mostly features.)
These have been added to the wiki and I look forward to working on that
backlog when I get home.

As for coding, I am doing little here, but I do have a branch cooking that
adds some options to `git annex import` to control handling of duplicate
files.
