On Friday, worked on several bugs in direct mode mapping code. Fixed it
to not crash on invalid unicode in filenames. Dealt with some bugs when
mappings were updated in subdirectories of the repository.

Those bugs could result in inconsistent mapping files, so today I
made `fsck` check mapping files for consistency.

Leaving for Australia tomorrow, but I also hope to get another bugfix
release out before my flight leaves. Then will be on vacation for several
days, more or less. Then at Linux Conf Australia, where there will
be a git-annex presentation on February 1st.

BTW, I've lined up my Android development hardware for next month. I will
be using an [Asus Transformer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASUS_Eee_Pad_Transformer),
kindly lent to me by Mark H. This has the advantage
of having a real keyboard, and running the (currently) second most widely used
version of Android, 4.0.x. I have already experienced frustration getting photos
off the thing and into my photo annex; the file manager is the worst I've
seen since the 80's. I understand why so many want an Android port!

Interestingly, its main user filesystem is a FUSE mount point on `/sdcard`
backed by an ext4 filesystem on `/data` that a regular user is not allowed
to access. Whatever craziness this entails does not support symlinks.
