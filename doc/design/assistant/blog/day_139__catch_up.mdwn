Got progress bars working for glacier. This needed some glacier-cli
changes, which Robie helpfully made earlier.

Spent some hours getting caught up and responding to bug reports, etc.

Spent a while trying to make git-annex commands that fail to find
any matching files to act on print a useful warning message,
rather than the current nothing. Concluded this will be surprisingly
hard to do, due to the multiple seek passes some commands perform. Update:
Thought of a non-invasive and not too ugly way to do this while on my
evening walk, and this wart is gone.
