Today I added a "Files" link in the navbar of the WebApp. It looks like a
regular hyperlink, but clicking on it opens up your desktop's native file
manager, to manage the files in the repository!

Quite fun to be able to do this kind of thing from a web page. :)

Made `git annex init` (and the WebApp) automatically generate a description
of the repo when none is provided.

Also worked on the configuration pages some. I don't want to get ahead
of myself by diving into the full configuration stage yet, but I am at
least going to add a configuration screen to clone the repo to a removable
drive.

After that, the list of transfers on the dashboard needs some love.
I'll probably start by adding UI to cancel running transfers, and then
try to get drag and drop reordering of transfers working.
