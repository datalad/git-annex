Two suggestion:
1. Possibility to restrict CPU usage (a 10-20% would be nice, or a slider)
2. Pager on Dashboard

I have a directory, it is 741MB, and contains 23381 files. 
This directory is pretty much everything needed for my daily job.

I added a copy of this directory to annex, then I created a backup dir of annex, 
and my laptop is using almost 100%CPU al the time, it is running since 1 hour already, and 
only 140MB was copied over to the backup directory.

Don't get me wrong, this application just blows my mind, and it seems to *work* for the first time for real.

The suggestion is simply a slider in resource manager (preferably inside dashboard):
Restrict CPU usage [0---X---100]34%
Restrict upload bandwith [0-X----800]9kB/s
Restrict download bandwith [0-X----800]80kB/s

Also the pager is musthave in dashboard, because it renders firefox unusable with that many entries (21000).

Nice work, thank you for the release!
