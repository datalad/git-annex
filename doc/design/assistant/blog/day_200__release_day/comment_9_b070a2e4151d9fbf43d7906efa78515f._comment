@joey Both .so files were present and I was able to run the ln and busybox commands. And after that 'git annex' displayed the help screen. Thanks!

Then I ran 'ps | grep ga.androidterm' to find the pid and then 'ls -l /proc/&lt;pid&gt;/exe' and it showed the symlink points at '/system/bin/app_process'.

So the 'int n=readlink(\"/proc/self/exe\", buf, 1023);' in start.c isn't very useful in this case.
