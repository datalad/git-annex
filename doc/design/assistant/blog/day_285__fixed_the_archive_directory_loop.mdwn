Yay, I fixed the
[[bugs/Handling_of_files_inside_and_outside_archive_directory_at_the_same_time]]
bug!
At least in direct mode, which thanks to its associated files tracking
knows when a given file has another file in the repository with the same
content. Had not realized the behavior in direct mode was so bad, or the
fix so relatively easy. Pity I can't do the same for indirect mode, but
the problem is much less serious there.

That was this weekend. Today, I nearly put out a new release (been 2 weeks
since the last one..), but ran out of time in the end, and need to get the
OSX autobuilder fixed first, so have deferred it until Friday.

However, I did make some improvements today.
Added an `annex.debug` git config setting, so debugging can
be turned on persistently. People seem to expect that to happen when
checking the checkbox in the webapp, so now it does.

Fixed 3 or 4 bugs in the Windows port. Which actually, has users now, or
at least one user. It's very handy to actually get real world testing of
that port.
