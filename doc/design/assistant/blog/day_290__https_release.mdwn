Spent too many hours last night tracking down a bug that caused the webapp
to hang when it got built with the new yesod 1.2 release. Much of that time
was spent figuring out that yesod 1.2 was causing the problem. It turned out to
be a stupid typo in my yesod compatability layer. `liftH = liftH` in
Haskell is an infinite loop, not the stack overflow you get in most
languages. ;)

Even though it's only been a week since the last release,
that was worth pushing a release out for, which I've just done.
This release is essentially all bug fixes (aside from the automatic 
ionice and nicing of the daemon).

This website is now available over https. Perhaps more importantly, all the
links to download git-annex builds are https by default.

The [[success_stories|day_288__success_stories]] list is getting really
nice. Only way it could possibly be nicer is if you added your story! Hint. ;)
