Joey, How does pairing on the local network work btw?
Now that you have experience intercepting and relaying the git pack output maybe you can use UDP broadcast on the local network for a truly fast sync.
With dropbox, I'm often syncing working copies of software projects between several VMs so I can test the code on all platforms before committing. I've found that to be faster (for builds) then using a VM shared folders, network shares, etc.
