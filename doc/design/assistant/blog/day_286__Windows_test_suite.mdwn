One of my Windows fixes yesterday got the test suite close to sort of
working on Windows, and I spent all day today pounding on it. Fixed
numerous bugs, and worked around some weird Windows behaviors -- like
recursively deleting a directory sometimes fails with a permission denied
error about a file in it, and leaves behind an empty directory. (What!?)
The most important bug I fixed caused CR to leak into files in the
git-annex branch from Windows, during a union merge, which was not a good
thing at all.

At the end of the day, I only have 6 remaining failing test cases on
Windows. Half of them are some problem where running `git annex sync`
from the test suite stomps on PATH somehow and prevents xargs from working.
The rest are probably real bugs in the directory (again something to do
with recursive directory deletion, hmmm..), hook, and rsync
special remotes on Windows. I'm punting on those 6 for now, they'll be
skipped on Windows.

Should be worth today's pain to know in the future when I break
something that I've oh-so-painfully gotten working on Windows.
