Just filling in a few remaining bits and pieces from this month's work.

* Made the assistant periodically check glacier-cli for archives that are
  ready, and queue downloads of them.
* The box.com configurator defaults to embedding the account info, allowing
  one-click enabling of the repository. There's a check box to control this.
* Fix some bugs with how the standalone images run git-annex.
* Included ssh in the standalone images.
* Various other bug fies.
