Spent a while tracking down a bug that causes a crash on OSX when setting
up an XMPP account. I managed to find a small test case that reliably
crashes, and sent it off to the author of the haskell-gnutls bindings,
which had one similar segfault bug fixed before with a similar test case.
Fingers crossed..

Just finished tracking down a bug in the Android app that caused its
terminal to spin and consume most CPU (and presumably a lot of battery).
I introduced this bug when adding the code to open urls written to a fifo,
due to misunderstanding how java objects are created, basically. This bug
is bad enough to do a semi-immediate release for; luckily it's just about
time for a release anyway with other improvements, so in the next few
days..

Have not managed to get a recent ghc-android to build so far.

Guilhem fixed some bugs in `git annex unused`.
