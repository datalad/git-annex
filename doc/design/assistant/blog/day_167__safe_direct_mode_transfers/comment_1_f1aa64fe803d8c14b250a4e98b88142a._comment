hmm, wouldn't it make sense to do the downloads into the annex object space, just like with indirect annexes? Then when the download is complete, with indirect annexes you create a soft link and with direct annexes you move the file (or create a hardlink and remove the directory entry in the annex object space)? Actually when you started to talk about direct I first envisioned it to be exactly like indirect, only with hard links instead of soft links.
