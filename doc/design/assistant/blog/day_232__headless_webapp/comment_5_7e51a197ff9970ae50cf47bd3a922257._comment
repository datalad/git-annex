Note that --listen=address:port had to be removed.

OTOH, the webapp can be run with a https certificate now, which makes remote access much more secure.

The webapp will use HTTPS if it finds
a .git/annex/privkey.pem and .git/annex/certificate.pem. Here's
one way to generate those files, using a self-signed certificate:

    openssl genrsa -out .git/annex/privkey.pem 4096
    openssl req -new -x509 -key .git/annex/privkey.pem > .git/annex/certificate.pem
