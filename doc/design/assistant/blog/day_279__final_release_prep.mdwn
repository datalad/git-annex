Landed two final changes before the release..

First, made git-annex detect if any of the several long-running git process
it talks to have died, and, if yes, restart them. My stress test is reliably
able to get at least `git cat-file` to crash, and while I don't know why (and
obviously should follow up by getting a core dump and stack trace of it),
the assistant needs to deal with this to be robust.

Secondly, wrote rather a lot of Java code to better open the web browser
when the Android app is started. A thread listens for URLs to be written to
a FIFO. Creating a FIFO from fortran&#94;Wjava code is .. interesting. Glad to
see the back of the `am` command; it did me no favors.

AFK
