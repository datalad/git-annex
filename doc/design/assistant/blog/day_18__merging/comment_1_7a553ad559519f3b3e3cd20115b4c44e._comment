Nice!
However I didnt find any documentation yet on how to actually resolve the situation as a user (sorry if I'm being blind).
To be more specific: Say a conflict occurs on foo.txt and i now have two files foo.variant-dead.txt and foo.variant-beef.txt.
Now what? Say I used my favorite merge diffmerge tool to create a merged version foo-merged.txt, should I rename that to foo.txt?
Should I delete the variant files? Or drop them? Or would that lead to another merge for systems that still have the old foo.txt?
(You see I'm kind of confused of what happens here ;))

TIA for any helpers
