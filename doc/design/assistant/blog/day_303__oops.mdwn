Seems I forgot why I was using debian stable chroots to make the
autobuilds: Lots of people still using old glibc version. Had to rebuild
the stable chroots that I had upgraded to unstable. Wasted several hours..
I was able to catch up on recent traffic in between.

Was able to reproduce a bug where `git annex initremote` hung with some
encrypted special remotes. Turns out to be a deadlock when it's not built
with the threaded GHC runtime. So I've forced that runtime to be used.
