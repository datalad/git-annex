Same Android device and same behavior as the above comment. While the connection attempt was being made, I switched to the terminal window and saw a connection to 173.194.46.86:5222 in the SYN_SENT state (and that connection wasn't there prior to the jabber configuration attempt).

Even from my desktop, manual connection attempts to 173.194.46.86:5222 timed out.

Then I ran the same jabber configuration from my desktop and it worked fin. Using netstat, I could see it connected to 74.125.133.125:5222.

So is the Android version using the wrong address?
