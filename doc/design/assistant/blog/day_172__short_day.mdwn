Only one bug fix today, but it was a doozie. It seems that gpg2 has an
incompatibility with the gpg 1.x that git-annex was written for, that
causes large numbers of excess passphrase prompts, when it's supposed to be
using a remote's symmetric encryption key. Adding the --batch parameter
fixed this.

I also put together a page listing [[related_software]] to git-annex.

I've also updated [[direct_mode]]'s documentation, about when it's safe to
use direct mode. The intuition I've developed about direct mode is that if
you don't need full versioning of files (with the ability to get back old
versions), direct mode is fine and safe to use. If you want full
versioning, it's best to not use direct mode. Or a reasonable compromise is
to `git annex untrust` the direct mode repository and set up a backup remote.
With this compromise, only if you edit a file twice in a row might the old
version get lost before it can be backed up.

Of course, it would be possible to make direct mode fully version
preserving, but it'd have to back up every file in the repository locally
to do so. Going back to two local copies of every file, which is part of
git that git-annex happily avoids. Hmm, it might be possible to only back
up a file locally until it reaches the backup remote..
