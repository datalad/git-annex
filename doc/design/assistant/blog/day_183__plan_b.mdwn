Have not tried to run my static binary on Android yet, but I'm already
working on a plan B in case that doesn't work. Yesterday I stumbled upon
<https://github.com/neurocyte/ghc-android>, a ghc cross-compiler for
Android that uses the Android native development kit. 
It first appeared on February 4th. Good timing!

I've gotten it to build and it emits arm executables, that seem to use the
Android linker. So that's very promising indeed. 

I've also gotten cabal working with it, and have it chewing through
installing git-annex's build dependencies.

----

Also made a release today, this is another release that's mostly bugfixes,
and a few minor features. Including one bug fixed at 6 am this morning, urk.

I think I will probably split my days between working on Android porting
and other git-annex development.
