Succeeded fixing a few bugs today, and followed up on a lot of other ones..

Fixed checking when content is present in a non-bare repository accessed via
http.

My changes a few days ago turned out to make uninit leave hard links behind
in .git/annex. Luckily the test suite caught this bug, and it was easily
fixed by making uninit delete objects with 2 or more hard links at the end.
