I was mostly working on other things today, but I did do some bug fixing.
The worst of these is a bug introduced in 3.20121009 that breaks
`git-annex-shell configlist`. That's pretty bad for using git-annex
on servers, although you mostly won't notice unless you're just getting
started using a ssh remote, since that's when it calls configlist.
I will be releasing a new version as soon as I have bandwidth (tomorrow).

Also made the standalone Linux and OSX binaries build with ssh connection
caching disabled, since they don't bundle their own ssh and need to work
with whatever ssh is installed.
