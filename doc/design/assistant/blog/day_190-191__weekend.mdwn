Pushed out a release yesterday mostly for a bug fix. I have to build
git-annex 5 times now when releasing. Am wondering if I could get rid of
the Linux 64 bit standalone build. The 32 bit build should run ok on 64 bit
Linux systems, since it has all its own 32 bit libraries. What I really
need to do is set up autobuilders for Linux and Android, like we have for OSX.

Today, dealt with all code that creates or looks at symlinks. Audited every
bit of it, and converted all relevant parts to use a new abstraction layer
that handles the pseudolink files git uses when core.symlinks=false.
This is untested, but I'm quite happy with how it turned out.

Where next for Android? I want to spend a while testing command-line
git-annex. After I'm sure it's really solid, I should try to get the webapp
working, if possible.

I've heard rumors that Ubuntu's version of ghc somehow supports template
haskell on arm, so I need to investigate that. If I am unable to get
template haskell on arm, I would need to either wait for further
developments, or try to expand yesod's template haskell to regular haskell
and then build it on arm, or I could of course switch away from hamlet
(using blaze-html instead is appealing in some ways) and
use yesod in non-template-haskell mode entirely. One of these will work,
for sure, only question is how much pain.

After getting the webapp working, there's still the issue of bundling it
all up in an Android app that regular users can install.
