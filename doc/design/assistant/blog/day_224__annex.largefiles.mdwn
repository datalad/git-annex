Built a feature for power users today. `annex.largefiles` can be
configured to specify what files `git annex add` and the assistant should
put into the annex. It uses the same syntax as [[/preferred_content]],
so arbitrarily complex expressions can be built.

For example, a game written in C with some large data files could
include only 100kb or larger files, that are not C code:

	annex.largefiles = largerthan=100kb and not (include=*.c or include=*.h) 

The assistant will commit small files to git directly!
`git annex add`, being a lower level tool, skips small files
and leaves it up to you to `git add` them as desired.

It's even possible to tell the assistant that no file is too large to be
committed directly to git. `git config annex.largefiles 'exclude=*'`
The result should be much like using SparkleShare or dvcs-autosync.

Also today, made the remote ssh server checking code in the webapp
deal with servers where the default shell is csh or some other non-POSIX
shell.
