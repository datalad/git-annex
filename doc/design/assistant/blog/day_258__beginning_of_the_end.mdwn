Fixed a nasty bug that affects at least some FreeBSD systems. It misparsed
the output of `sha256`, and thought every file had a SHA256 of "SHA256".
Added multiple layers of protection against checksum programs not having
the expected output format.

Lots more building and rebuilding today of Android libs than I wanted to do.
Finally have a completly clean build, which might be able to open TCP
connections. Will test tomorrow.

In the meantime,Â I fired up the evil twin of my development laptop.
It's identical, except it runs Windows.

I installed the Haskell Platform for Windows on it, and removed
some of the bloatware to free up disk space and memory for development.
While a rather disgusting experience, I certainly have a usable Haskell
development environment on this OS a lot faster than I did on Android!
Cabal is happily installing some stuff, and other stuff wants me to install
Cygwin.

So, the clock on my month of working on a Windows port starts now. Since
I've already done rather a lot of ground work that was necessary for a
Windows port (direct mode, crippled filesystem support), and for general
sanity and to keep everything else from screeching to a halt, I plan to
only spend half my time messing with Windows over the next 30 days.
