Pushed out a release today. While I've somewhat ramped down activity this
month with the Kickstarter period over and summer trips and events ongoing,
looking over the changelog I still see a ton of improvements in the 20 days
since the last release.

Been doing some work to make the assistant daemon be more `nice`. I don't
want to nice the whole program, because that could make the web interface
unresponsive. What I am able to do, thanks to Linux violating POSIX, is to
`nice` certain expensive operations, including the startup scan and the daily
sanity check. Also, I put in a call to `ionice` (when it's available) 
when `git annex assistant --autostart` is run, so the daemon's
disk IO will be prioritized below other IO. Hope this keeps it out of your
way while it does its job.
