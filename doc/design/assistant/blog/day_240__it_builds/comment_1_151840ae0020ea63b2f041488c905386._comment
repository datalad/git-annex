Hi,

Seems like the duplicated file issue finally resolved in this release, 
also the logging is not so detailed, so it does not explode the disk space either.

I think a new bug introduced in this release, 
namely if you create a repository and a backup repository of it (pendrive), then this repository is not in direct mode by default.
(and there is a missing direct = True variable in that repository (/mnt/dat/annex_backup/.git/annex/config)).

Also I run into resource exhausted bug, and every thread is crashed.
Can git-annex only watch a directory, and not every file in it?

I will create a bugreport for resource exhausted.

Best, 
 Laszlo
