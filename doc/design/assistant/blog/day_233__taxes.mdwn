Did my taxes today. Not very pretty. Planning to run them by a professional.

Reproduced a bug that prevents git-annex from authenticating to the ejabberd
server, and passed the buck upstream with a test case to the author of the
haskell XMPP library.

Added some animations to the webapp to show when it's busy doing things.

Made `git annex webapp --listen=address:port` work.

Added a `annex.web-download-command` setting.
