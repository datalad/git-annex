Biding my time while [[desymlink]] gells in my head..

Fixed a bug in the assistant's local pairing that rejected ssh keys with a
period in the comment.

Fixed a bug in the assistant that made it try to drop content from remotes
that didn't have it, and avoided a drop failure crashing a whole assistant
thread.

Made --auto behave better when preferred content is set.

Looked into making the transfer queue allow running multiple transfers at
the same time, ie, one per remote. This seems to essentially mean splitting
the queue into per remote queues. There are some complexities, and I
decided not to dive into working through it right now, since it'd be
a distraction from thinking about [[desymlink]]. Will revisit it later.

Allow specifying a port when setting up a ssh remote.

While doing that, noticed that the assistant fails to transfer files to
sync to a ssh remote that was just added. That got broken while optimising
reconnecting with a remote; fixed it.
