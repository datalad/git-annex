From a mail I received: --[[Joey]]

Git-annex makes it possible for me to have lots of data.  Before I
started using it I had a music library and a few massive tar files,
none of it properly backed up, and occasionally there would be random
corruption (I still have broken mp3s which jump and stutter in places)
because I would carelessly cp them from HDD to HDD.  So I'd avoid
actually letting data accumulate; this was inconvenient in itself.
Now git-annex does everything for me.

Following your development blog, as a novice programmer, has been
really enjoyable and interesting.  My only experience of professional
IT has put me of but it's good to see you working through things
methodically and properly.
