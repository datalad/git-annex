Hi Joey,

More than ten years ago, I was looking for a software to index the content of all my
CD-ROMs in order to create a kind of \"table of content\". Today there is
git-annex!

I discovered git-annex few months ago and it really helps me to keep my file
well organized. I missed the first crowd funding campaign but would be happy
to contribute to the next one :D

I mainly use four different annexes for:

* my private photos and videos,
* my music collection,
* my other multimedia files (movies...),
* my other files that are too large to be commited into git directly (pdf, binaries...).

I use git-annex manually via the command line. I started to play with the
assistant on my Android tablet and I plan to install it on my wife's
Macbook to synchronize her data with the NAS.

A standalone build for arm to run git-annex on my NAS (QNAP 219 PII) would be perfect :-P

Thank you very much for all your great softwares (yes I also use etckeeper,
some moreutils tools and more recently ikiwiki).

-Julien
