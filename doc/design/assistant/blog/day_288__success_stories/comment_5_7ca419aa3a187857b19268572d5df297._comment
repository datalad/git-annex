Excerpt from an email I received: --[[Joey]]

Another story, but without the assistant this time: I've \"designed\" a
small f2f file sharing network with it, I'm using it with a friend to
share accross several computer. This is basically a workflow
with git annex and gitoline, the flexibility of git and the capacities
of git annex just gave us this out of the box. Some specs are here if
you are curious
