We use rsync and tar to backup to a server on the local network, and since we discoverd git-annex, we use this mechanism to automatically put all this data in both a local bup repo and a remote one. This gives us a daily full backup, with history available, both locally and off-site. Thanks to bup our 4T of data gets deduplicated to about 270G, only a couple of megs get transferred every night, and thanks to git-annex everything just works, like it should!
