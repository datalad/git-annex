Hi,

I have moved all my photographs to an annex running on a Ubuntu file server while doing photo editing, presenting etc. on my MacBook. The annex is great in selectively moving files between these machines for editing and presentation purposes. I started using it around christmas season last year and added a glacier \"backup\" recently. My statistics: 6 repositories in total, more than 300GB (dedup'd from 380GB), 60.000 local keys.

What is missing from my point of view (and I would happily join crowd funding): stable windows and android versions, managing selective transfers from the assistant (select folders to be transferred from/to a specific repository), options for running the annex as a server daemon with web GUI (authentication to GUI + fixed URLs, status reports on GUI, etc.). All these would dramatically increase the WAF.
