Looks like I started using git-annex in November 2010.

I'd already been tracking lots of small files in my home directory (settings, scripts, notes, todo list, timesheets, invoices, etc) with git.

So awesome to get backups, syncing and manual merge conflict resolution.

git-annex extended that to handle my larger files. git-annex's ability to be selective about what is stored where, allowed my to still be able to git clone my home directory onto small devices (I've got a debian chroot with only 6GB or so, and I installed debian on my new chromebook, that's only got 16GB of disk space (for the whole system.))

I love having the full catalog visible on my filesystem with symlinks, and I can just request a file, and git-annex will figure out where to get it from, even if I'm away from home on my laptop.

I just got a 2nd external hard drive, and I'm delighted with how easy it was to get a backup of everything on there.

I was able to quickly and safely clear up space on my desktop computer! I'm confident that my data is safe because I've got git-annex configured to make sure there's at least two copies of my videos, and 3 copies of everything else.

I've finally gone from either keeping hard drives from my past computers or keeping a full copy of the data, to having a proper archiving and backup system for all files I care about.

I've got over 12,000 files stored on my main annex, and it's perfectly responsive.

Joey does a great job, and has been very responsive on the rare occasions where I needed help.

Three cheers!
