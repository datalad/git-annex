I needed an easy day, and I got one. Configurator in the webapp for Box.com
came together really quickly and easily, and worked on the first try.

Also filed a [bug](https://github.com/vincenthz/hs-cryptocipher/issues/21)
on the Haskell library that is failing on portknox.com's SSL certificate.
That site is the only OwnCloud provider currently offering free WebDAV
storage. Will hold off on adding OwnCloud to the webapp's cloud provider lists
until that's fixed.
