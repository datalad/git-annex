Quiet day. Only did minor things, like adding webapp UI for changing the
directory used by Internet Archive remotes, and splitting out an
`enableremote` command from `initremote`.

My Android development environment is set up and ready to go on my Motorola
Droid. The current Android build of git-annex fails to link at run time, so
my work is cut out for me. Probably broke something while enabling XMPP?
