Been keeping several non-coding balls in the air recently, two of which
landed today.

First, Rsync.net is [offering a discount to all git-annex users](http://www.rsync.net/products/git-annex-pricing.html),
at one third their normal price.
"People using git-annex are clueful and won't be a big support burden for us,
so it's a win-win."
The web app will be updated offer the discount when setting up a rsync.net
repository.

Secondly, I've recorded an interview today for the Git Minutes podcast,
about git-annex. Went well, looking forward to it going up, probably on
Monday.
