Got `git annex add` (and `addurl`) working in direct mode. This allowed me
to make `git annex sync` in direct mode no longer automatically add new
files.

It's also now safe to mix direct mode annexed files with regular files in
git, in the same repository. Might have been safe all along, but I've
tested it, and it certainly works now. You just have to be careful to not
use `git commit -a` to commit changes to such files, since that'll also 
stage the entire content of direct mode files.

Made a minor release for these recent changes and bugfixes. Recommended if
you're using direct mode. Had to chase down a stupid typo I made yesterday
that caused fsck to infinite loop if it found a corrupted file. Thank
goodness for test suites.
