Today I got to deal with bugs on Android (busted use of `cp` among other
problems), Windows (fixed a strange hang when adding several files), and
Linux (`.desktop` files suck and Wine ships a particularly nasty one).
Pretty diverse!

Did quite a lot of research and thinking on XMPP encryption yesterday, but
have not run any code yet (except for trying out a D-H exchange in `ghci`).
I have listed several options on the [[XMPP]] page.

Planning to take a look at
[[bugs/Handling_of_files_inside_and_outside_archive_directory_at_the_same_time]]
tomorrow; maybe I can come up with a workaround to avoid it behaving so
badly in that case.
