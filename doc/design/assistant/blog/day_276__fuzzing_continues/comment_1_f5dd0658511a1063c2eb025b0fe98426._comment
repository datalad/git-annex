Does the Android application use a [WakeLock](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/PowerManager.WakeLock.html) to ensure syncing happens even if the device screen goes off?

I'm under the impression that it doesn't since it took a very long time to sync the first time (before I used the terminal's options to prevent the phone from sleeping).

I think that option shouldn't be left on since it would waste the battery and I think the application should block sleep mode only when syncing.

I might be wrong. I never had to use a WakeLock on Android yet.
