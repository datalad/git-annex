1. Im not able to set direct mode (linux build, Version: 3.20130102 in about page).
Is there something specific needed? I started fresh. I added a new directory (empty), once 
git annex assistant started, I copied files to that directory, and the assistant 
replaced all files with symlinks, just as before.
What am I missing here?

2. It is just minor usability remark:
 I would like to see in the gui somewhere shown where the actual config is stored (~/.config/git-annex), 
and an option to wipe it out and start fresh. Also a restart button.

Best, Laszlo
