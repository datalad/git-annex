Usecase:
Keep two directories in sync on the same computer.

\"Removable drive\" almost covers this, except you need an usb thumbdrive 
permanently plugged into the computer.

Would be nice, if I could select a \"sync to this local folder\" option 
alongside the \"Select drive:\" option.

So it is my choice if I want to sync to a partition or to a folder.

Bug(?):
I created two repositories:
/mnt/dxd/annex 
/mnt/dxd/annex2

And I added a \"Removable drive\" syncing option to /mnt/dxd/annex2, and I selected the \"/mnt/dxd\" drive as removable drive.
The two repositories got mixed together 
(ie. broken symlinks pointing to nonexistent .git/annex/objects/.. file)

Best, 
 Laszlo
