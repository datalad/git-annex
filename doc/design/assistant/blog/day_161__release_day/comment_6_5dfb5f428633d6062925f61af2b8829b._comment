another problem:
1. If you add a removable drive via the gui, you can not remove it anymore (from the gui)
2. If you delete the directory on the removable drive, git-annex assistant silently fails
to recreate the directory and start fresh.
2/a. on the gui, there is no indication something is wrong with the removable drive repository
2/b on the terminal it shows only this: 
fatal: Not a git repository: '/mnt/dxd/annex/.git'

On the main page it shows the two repositories, but on the upper right corner, the dropdown menu
contains only the original repository and not the removeable drive repository.

I stop spaming now...
