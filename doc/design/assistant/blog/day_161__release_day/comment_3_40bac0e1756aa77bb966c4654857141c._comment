I added like this:
0. no git-annex or git-annex-assistant is running
1. create directory (/mnt/dxd/annex)
2. launch git-annex-assistant
3. add repository via the webbrowser
4. copy a file over this(/mnt/dxd/annex) directory (via command line or nautilus)

The file is replaced with symlink.

This fix the issue:
0. stop git-annex-assistant
1. Go in the shell to that directory (cd /mnt/dxd/annex)
2. switch to direct mode (/home/looser/Desktop/download/git-annex.linux/git-annex direct)
3. start git-annex-assistant
4. create a new repository(/mnt/dxd/annex2) via the webbrowser (add repository in top right corner)
5. Now:
/mnt/dxd/annex - NOT in direct mode (symlinks created instantly)
/mnt/dxd/annex2 - in direct mode

Im really happy I have finally direct mode running. 
I will surely stress-test git-annex in the coming weeks.

Awesome.

Thank you for the answer.
