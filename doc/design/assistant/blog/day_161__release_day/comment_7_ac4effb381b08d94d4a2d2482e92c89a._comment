Can not withstand myself.

1. If you add a Removable drive repository, only the *new* files are copied over to the removable drive.
2. Removable drive repository is not in direct mode. 
Would be nice if it could be kept the same mode as the original repository.
It is some kind of special repsoitory, I do not see any seemlinks either.
