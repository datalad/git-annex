\"I added a new directory (empty)\"

Sounds like you set up the repository yourself, rather than letting the assistant do it. If so, it won't be in direct mode. You can `git annex assistant--stop`, and then `git annex direct` to enable direct mode.

Restart/shutdown in the UI coming soon, I think.

The entire git-annex configuration, include that of the assistant, is stored in the `.git/config` of your reposository, and on its `git-annex` branch. Deleting the repository is thus all that's needed to start over.
