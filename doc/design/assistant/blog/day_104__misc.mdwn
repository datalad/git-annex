Switched the OSX standalone app to use `DYLD_ROOT_PATH`.
This is the third `DYLD_*` variable I've tried; neither
of the other two worked in all situations. This one may do better.
If not, I may be stuck modifying the library names in each executable
using `install_name_tool`
([good reference for doing that](http://www.mikeash.com/pyblog/friday-qa-2009-11-06-linking-and-install-names.html)).
As far as I know, every existing dynamic library lookup system is broken
in some way other other; nothing I've seen about OSX's so far
disproves that rule.

Fixed a nasty utf-8 encoding crash that could occur when merging the
git-annex branch. I hope I'm almost done with those.

Made git-annex auto-detect when a git remote is on a sever like github
that doesn't support git-annex, and automatically set annex-ignore.

Finished the UI for pausing syncing of a remote. Making the syncing
actually stop still has some glitches to resolve.
