It all came together for Android today. Went from a sort of working app
to a fully working app!

* rsync.net works.
* Box.com appears to work -- at least it's failing with the same
  timeout I get on my linux box here behind the firewall of dialup doom.
* XMPP is working too!

These all needed various little fixes. Like loading TLS certificates from
where they're stored on Android, and ensuring that totally crazy file
permissions from Android (----rwxr-x for files?!) don't leak out into rsync
repositories. Mostly though, it all just fell into place today.
Wonderful..

The Android autobuild is updated with all of today's work, so try it out.
