Today is a planning day. I have only a few days left before I'm off to
Nicaragua for [DebConf](http://debconf12.debconf.org/), where I'll only
have smaller chunks of time without interruptions. So it's important to get
some well-defined smallish chunks designed that I can work on later. See
bulleted action items below (now moved to [[syncing]]. Each
should be around 1-2 hours unless it turns out to be 8 hours... :)

First, worked on writing down a design, and some data types, for data transfer
tracking (see [[syncing]] page). Found that writing down these simple data
types before I started slinging code has clarified things a lot for me.

Most importantly, I realized that I will need to modify `git-annex-shell`
to record on disk what transfers it's doing, so the assistant can get that
information and use it to both avoid redundant transfers (potentially a big
problem!), and later to allow the user to control them using the web app.

While eventually the user will be able to use the web app to prioritize
transfers, stop and start, throttle, etc, it's important to get the default
behavior right. So I'm thinking about things like how to prioritize uploads
vs downloads, when it's appropriate to have multiple downloads running at
once, etc.
