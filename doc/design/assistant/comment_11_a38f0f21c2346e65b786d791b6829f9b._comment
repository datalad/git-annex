Yeah definately go with homebrew rather than macports if possible. macports and fink, whilst great systems, have a tendency to sort of create their own alternative-dimension of files within the system that just dont always feel particularly well integrated. As a result \"brew\" has become increasingly more popular to the point its almost ubuquitous now.

Plus its brew-doctor thing is awesome. 

The best approach though thats agnostic to distro systems is to simply go for a generic installer.
