It's not much for now... but see <http://www.sgenomics.org/~jtang/gitbuilder-git-annex-x00-x86_64-apple-darwin10.8.0/> I'm ignoring the debian-stable and pristine-tar branches for now, as I am just building and testing on osx 10.7.

Hope the autobuilder will help you develop the OSX side of things without having direct access to an osx machine! I will try and get gitbuilder to spit out appropriately named tarballs of the compiled binaries in a few days when I have more time.
