The Android port is just about usable. Still, we have some fun todo items
to improve it.

## high-priority TODO

* [[bugs/Android_app_permission_denial_on_startup]]
* S3 doesn't work (at least to Internet Archive: 
  "connect: does not exist (connection refused)")
* Get app into Google Play and/or FDroid

## TODO

* Don't make app initially open terminal + webapp, but go to a page that
  allows opening the webapp or terminal.  
  Possibly, switch from running inside terminal app to real standalone app.
  See <https://github.com/neurocyte/android-haskell-activity>
  and <https://github.com/neurocyte/foreign-jni>.

* I have seen an assistant thread crash with an interrupted system call
  when the device went to sleep while it was running. Auto-detect and deal with
  that somehow.
* Make git stop complaining that "warning: no threads uspport, ignoring --threads"
* git does not support http remotes. To fix, need to port libcurl and
  allow git to link to it.
* getEnvironment is broken on Android <https://github.com/neurocyte/ghc-android/issues/7>
  and a few places use it. I have some horrible workarounds in place.
* Get local pairing to work. network-multicast and network-info don't
  currently install.
* Get test suite to pass. `git clone` of a local repo fails on android
  for some reason.
* Make app autostart on boot, optionally. <http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1056570/how-to-autostart-an-android-application>
* The app should be aware of power status, and avoid expensive background
  jobs when low on battery or run flat out when plugged in.
* The app should be aware of network status, and avoid expensive data
  transfers when not on wifi. This may need to be configurable.
* glacier and local pairing are not yet enabled for Android.
* The "Files" link doesn't start a file browser. Should be possible to do
  on Android via intents, I suppose?
* Adding removable drives would work, but the android app is not in the 
  appropriate group to write to them. `WRITE_MEDIA_STORAGE` permission
  needed. Added to AndroidManifest, but did not seem to be used.
  Googleing for it will find a workaround that needs a rooted device.
