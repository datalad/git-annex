I think this feature is really important.  For my use cases, if I can't modify files that are in the folder that is kept in sync, then I would just use rsync or manually keep copies on multiple systems..

I might be missing something, but tried a git annex unlock on the file, but if the assistant is running, it seems to revert this back.
