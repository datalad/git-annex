> One approach for this would be to hide the git repo away somewhere, and have the git-annex assistant watch a regular directory, with regular files.

I think this would be the single most important feature added to git-annex.
1. It could be used to backup regularly a smb share over the network.
2. For those who dont trust a program who modifies their files directly. 
(I had a 3GB permanent data loss, when trying to push a 10GB directory into git annex.)
3. Android 

I do hope the above method will be implemented for Android too, so its like two birds with one stone. 
(Im really for option 2 here. I dont like the very idea of modifying my files directly. 
Git does not do it either, I have disk space (if not I buy more disks), rather then risquing losing important datas)

Best, 
 Laszlo
