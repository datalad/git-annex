[OTR](http://www.cypherpunks.ca/otr/) seems a natural fit for end-to-end encryption over xmpp. I can't find Haskell bindings for libotr at this moment, but creating those instead of inventing new protocols might be worth considering. There are also several [native implementations](http://www.cypherpunks.ca/otr/software.php) (Python, Go, Scheme), but I'm not sure if that's worth the effort.
