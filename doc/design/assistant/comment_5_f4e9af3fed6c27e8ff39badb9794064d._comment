In relation to macports, I often found that haskell in macports are often behind other distros, and I'm not willing to put much effort into maintaining or updating those ports. I found that to build git-annex, installing macports manually and then installing haskell-platform from the upstream to be the best way to get the most up to date dependancies for git-annex.

fyi in macports ghc is at version 6.10.4 and haskell platform is at version 2009.2, so there are a significant number of ports to update.

I was thinking about this a bit more and I reckon it might be easier to try and build a self contained .pkg package and have all the needed binaries in a .app styled package, that would work well when the webapp comes along. I will take a look at it in a week or two (currently moving house so I dont have much time)
