Thanks Bernard, that's really massively useful. It makes sense -- statically building with libc should work, the Android kernel is still Linux after all. 

To get past the iconv problem, I think all you need is part of the `locales` package from your linux system installed on the Android. Probably just a few of the data files from /usr/share/i18n/charmaps/
