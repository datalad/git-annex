`/usr/share/i18n/` does not exists on my Debian ARM system :/

however, `strace ./arm` in the debian chroot reveals that some files from `/usr/lib/gconv/` are loaded:

    [...]
    open(\"/usr/lib/gconv/UTF-32.so\", O_RDONLY) = 3
    read(3, \"\177ELF\1\1\1\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\3\0(\0\1\0\0\0\4\4\0\0004\0\0\0\"..., 512) = 512
    [...]

full log: <http://wien.tomnetworks.com/strace_arm>.  Unfortunately, I don't have `strace` in the android userland for comparison.

Just copying the related `gconv` files didn't work. I don't have so much time at the moment, I'll investigate further in some days or so.

At least, output using `error :: String -> a` does work :-)
