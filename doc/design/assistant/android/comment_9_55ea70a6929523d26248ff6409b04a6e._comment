I'd like to have my phone sync a bunch of files when I'm at home and when I get to work, have them synced to my work machine, deleted off my phone and when I get home, also deleted off my home machine.

This will allow incremental backups to a local folder at home and I can then \"mule\" my files, sneaker-net style, to work with zero user intervention. It only works if events can be triggered or I can combine a triggering app with a special android intent for both ends of my trip.
