I tried to install the version for android 5 on my nexus 5 with the most recent firmware. The initial sync (git clone) succeeds, the git annex stuff fails with \"remote origin does not have git-annex installed; setting annex-ignore\".

I have the android 4 version working on my tablet for the same ssh remote, so I think the remote is OK.

I can provide full logs of the terminal session if needed (I didn't use the assistant front end).

BTW: this is great software, thanks you so very much! I hope to have it up and running on all my devices soon as a replacement for Google Drive. I happen to care about privacy.
