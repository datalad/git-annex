Just so this does not get lost: For better or for worse, the vanilla Android devices stopped shipping with micro-SD support in 2011 (or 2010 if the Nexus S does not support them either; on sketchy GPRS so not googling around). Most higher-end Android devices ship with at least 8 GiB of on-board Flash storage, some even go up to 64 GiB.

IMHO, this would make it viable to first get git-annex working on Android without regard for FAT.

The obvious advantage is that porting should be easier and quicker.

The obvious downside is that this may mean revisiting some parts of the code later.
