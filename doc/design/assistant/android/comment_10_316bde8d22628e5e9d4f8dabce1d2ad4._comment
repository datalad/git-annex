One of the points is:

* The app should be aware of power status, and avoid expensive background jobs when low on battery or run flat out when plugged in.

This isn't good for situations where the device is plugged in and charging, but will only be so for a limited time (such as charging during a car journey) as the device would charge slower.

Could this behaviour be configurable too?
