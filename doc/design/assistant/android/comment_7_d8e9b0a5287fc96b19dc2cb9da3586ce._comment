Actually, this is something that would be ideal for a poll:

Should FAT-based Android repos be implemented:

* Immediately
* After the initial release of the Android app is working
* Before the kickstarter ends
* Not at all

Also, as another data point, the FAT-based SD card can be mounted as USB storage by any computer an Android device is connected to whereas the EXT4-based root FS can only be accessed via MTP.
