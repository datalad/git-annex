A minor point, but is saving a couple of bytes per message worth using a [deprecated feature](http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml-names/#iri-use) of the namespaces specification? This is not technically *breaking* the current specification, since \"git-annex\" is of course still a (relative) URI reference; and anyway chances of problems are, I guess, slim. But is it the lesser of two bugs?

The shortest moderately sane absolute URI containing \"git-annex\" would probably be \"data:,git-annex\".
