So, Yesod's scaffolded site actually does use bootstrap, but I didn't use the scaffolded site so don't have it. I am not quite to the point of doing any theming of the webapp, but I do have this nice example of how to put in bootstrap right here..

By the way, if anyone would like to play with the html templates for the webapp, the main html template is `templates/default-layout.hamlet`. Uses a slightly weird template markup, but plain html will also work. And there's also the `static/` directory; every file in there will be compiled directly into the git-annex binary, and is available at `http://localhost:port/static/$file` in the webapp. See the favicon link in `default-layout.hamlet` of how to construct a type-safe link to a static file: `href=@{StaticR favicon_ico}`. That's all you really need to theme the webapp, without doing any real programming!
