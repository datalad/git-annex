The closure of [this](http://hackage.haskell.org/trac/ghc/ticket/5839) ticket hopefully marks the end of TH issues on ARM. As of 7.4.2, GHC's linker has enough ARM support to allow a selection of common packages compile on my PandaBoard. That being said, it hasn't had a whole lot of testing so it's possible I still need to implement a few relocation types.
