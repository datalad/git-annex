> Instruct the user's web browser to open an url that contains a secret token. This guards against other users on the same system.

How will you implement that? Running \"sensible-browser URL\" would be the obvious way, but the secret URL would show up in a well timed ps listing. (And depending on the browser, ps may show the URL the entire time it's running.)
