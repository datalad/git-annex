We're on month 4 of work, and most of months 1-3 is done well enough for a first pass. Very little of what's listed in month 4 has happened yet, due to my being maybe 2 weeks behind schedule, but bits of [[cloud]] are being planned.

I've made a small adjustment, I think it'll make sense to spend a month on user-driven features before getting into Android.
