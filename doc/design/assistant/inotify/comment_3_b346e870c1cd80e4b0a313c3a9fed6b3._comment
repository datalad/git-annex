In relation to OSX support, hfsevents (or supporting hfs is probably a bad idea), its very osx specific and users who are moving usb keys and disks between systems will probably end up using fat32/exfat/vfat disks around. Also if you want I can lower the turn around time for the OSX auto-builder that I have setup to every 1 or 2mins? would that help?
