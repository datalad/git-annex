“Google drive (attractive because it's free, only 5 gb tho)”

Just in case somebody also wants their 5GB of disk space in the cloud, consider using some of the [owncloud providers](http://owncloud.org/providers/). They also offer that amount, but they use free software for everything, using standard protocols (WebDav mostly, because is well supported in all OS).

Git Annex works with them through davfs2, but it would be great if it could support this other program/protocol (OwnCloud/WebDAV) in a more integrated way.
