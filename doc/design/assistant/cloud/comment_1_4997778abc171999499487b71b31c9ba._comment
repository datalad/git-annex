Hey Joey!

I'm not very tech savvy, but here is my question. 
I think for all cloud service providers, there is an upload limitation on how big one file may be.
For example, I can't upload a file bigger than 100 MB on box.net. 
Does this affect git-annex at all? Will git-annex automatically split the file depending on the cloud provider or will I have to create small RAR archives of one large file to upload them?

Thanks!
James
