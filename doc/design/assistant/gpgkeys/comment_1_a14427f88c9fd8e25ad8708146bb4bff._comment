Regarding backups, have you considered using [paperkey](http://www.jabberwocky.com/software/paperkey/) (also [in Debian](http://packages.debian.org/search?keywords=paperkey))?
It only stores a minimal amount of key data and formats it in a human-readable way.

The result is mainly meant to be printed but `paperkey` would probably also be a good way to keep the size of QR codes down.

I've actually recovered a key from a such a printed backup (using OCR) and it worked great thanks to line-wise checksums.
Maybe you could create paperkey PDF files with a proper OCR font through the web app?
