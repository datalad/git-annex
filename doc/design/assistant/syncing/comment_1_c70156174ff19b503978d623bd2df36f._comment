How will the assistant know which files' data to distribute between the repos?

I'm using git-annex and it's numcopies attribute to maintain a redundant archive spread over different computers and usb drives. Not all drives should get a copy of everything, e.g. the usb drive I take to work should not automatically get a copy of family pictures.

How about .gitattributes?

* \* annex.auto-sync-data = false # don't automatically sync the data
* archive/ annex.auto-push-repos = NAS # everything added to archive/ in any repo goes automatically to the NAS remote.
* work/ annex.auto-synced-repos = LAPTOP WORKUSB # everything added to work/ in LAPTOP or WORKUSB gets synced to WORKUSB and LAPTOP
* work/ annex.auto-push-repos = LAPTOP WORKUSB # stuff added to work/ anywhere gets synced to LAPTOP and WORKUSB
* important/ annex.auto-sync-data = true # push data to all repos
* webserver_logs/ annex.remote.WEBSERVER.auto-push-repos = S3 # only the assistant running in WEBSERVER pushes webserver_logs/ to S3 remote
