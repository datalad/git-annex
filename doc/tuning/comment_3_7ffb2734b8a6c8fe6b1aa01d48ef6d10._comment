> Also, it's not safe to merge two separate git repositories that have been tuned differently (or one tuned and the other one not). git-annex will prevent merging their git-annex branches together, but it cannot prevent git merge remote/master merging two branches, and the result will be ugly at best (git annex fix can fix up the mess somewhat).

I'm highly interested in the lowercase option since current behavior has lead to a number of file duplications that are still not solved.  My main use repo is 1.7TB large and holds 172.000+ annexed files and I'm definitely not the only one with a big repo.

Does migrating to a tuned repository mean unannexing everything and reimporting into a newly created annex, replica by replica then sync again? That's a high price in some setup.  Or is there a way to somehow `git annex sync` between a newly created repo and an old, untuned one?
