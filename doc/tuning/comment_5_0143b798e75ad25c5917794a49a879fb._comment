`annex.tune.objecthash1=true` and `annex.tune.branchhash1=true` seem like they could be helpful in reducing git annex's inode usage, but the disclaimer about this feature being experimental is a little worrying.

Since this it is over 10 years old though, is it still considered experimental or has it graduated to being a stable feature? I.e. will using this meaningfully increase the chance of losing data?


Also, what is the (potential) benefit of using lowercase for the hashes?
