I'm looking for a way to express that remotes may be of differing reliability. E.g. some remotes are on RAIDs that are robust to disk failures, but others are on single, possibly external disks. I would like copies of a file on a reliable remote to count for more than those on an unreliable one, so that e.g. git-annex requires two copies on single disks but allows one on a RAID.

Is there a way to do this via the copies logic? Or some other method?
