# NAME

git-annex reinject - inject content of file back into annex

# SYNOPSIS

git annex reinject `[src dest]`

git annex reinject --known `[src]`

# DESCRIPTION

Moves the content of the src file or files into the annex.
Only known file contents will be reinjected. Any unknown src files will
be left unchanged.

This can be useful if you have obtained the content of a file from
elsewhere and want to put it in the local annex. For example, if a file's
content has been lost and you have a backup, you can restore the backup and
reinject it into your local repository.

There are two ways to use this command. Specifying a src file and the name
of a dest file (located inside the repository's working tree)
injects the src file as the content of the dest file.

	git annex reinject /tmp/foo.iso foo.iso

Or the `--known` option can be used to reinject all known src files, without
needing to specify the dest file.

	git annex reinject --known /tmp/*.iso

# OPTIONS

* `--known`

  With this option, each specified src file is hashed using the default
  key-value backend (or the one specified with `--backend`), and if git-annex
  has a record of the resulting key having been in the annex before, the
  content is reinjected.

  Note that, when using a key-value backend that includes the filename
  extension in the key, this will only work if the src files have the same
  extensions as the files with the same content that was originally added
  to git-annex.

  Note that this will reinject old versions of files that have been
  modified or deleted from the current git branch.
  Use [[git-annex-unused]](1) to detect when such old and potentially
  unused files have been reinjected.

* `--backend`

  Specify the key-value backend to use when checking if a file is known
  with the `--known` option.

* `--json`

  Enable JSON output. This is intended to be parsed by programs that use
  git-annex. Each line of output is a JSON object.

* `--json-error-messages`

  Messages that would normally be output to standard error are included in
  the JSON instead.

* Also the [[git-annex-common-options]](1) can be used.
