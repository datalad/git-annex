That --list turns out to come from the criterion library, and you can
actually use it but only if you provide the mandatory "-- command"
parameters too. For example:

	git-annex benchmark --list -- version
	version

That's not useful at all, since all if can list is the same benchmark you
provide on input. But this is a consequence of supporting other criterion
options like --iters and --csv that can be useful.

`git-annex benchmark` does not use a canned set of benchmarks; it
benchmarks a git-annex subcommand or subcommands that you specify.
