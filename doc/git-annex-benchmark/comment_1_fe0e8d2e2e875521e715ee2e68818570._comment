I see there is a `--list` command to list benchmarks but it just \"errored out\" with 

```
‚ùØ git annex benchmark --list
Missing: COMMAND

Usage: git-annex COMMAND
  git-annex - benchmarking
... here comes long list of all commands ...
```

of which that short `Usage:` help seems to be wrong (I did give the command) but I wonder what would be the invocation of `annex benchmark` if I were to run a collection of benchmarks to compare different filesystems, like I did in the past in [https://www.datalad.org/test_fs_analysis.html](https://www.datalad.org/test_fs_analysis.html)?

FWIW git-annex version 10.20220724 (same with 10.20221003)
