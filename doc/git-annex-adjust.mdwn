# NAME

git-annex adjust - enter an adjusted branch

# SYNOPSIS

git annex adjust --unlock`

# DESCRIPTION

Enters an adjusted form of the current branch. The annexed files will
be treated differently. For example with --unlock all annexed files will
be unlocked.

The adjusted branch will have a name like "adjusted/master(unlocked)".
Since it's a regular git branch, you can use `git checkout` to switch
back to the original branch at any time.

While in the adjusted branch, you can use git-annex and git commands as
usual. Any commits that you make will initially only be made to the
adjusted branch. 

To propigate changes from the adjusted branch back to the original branch,
and to other repositories, as well as to merge in changes from other
repositories, use `git annex sync`.

This command can only be used in a v6 git-annex repository.

# OPTIONS

* `--unlock`

  Unlock all annexed files in the adjusted branch. This allows
  annexed files to be modified.
