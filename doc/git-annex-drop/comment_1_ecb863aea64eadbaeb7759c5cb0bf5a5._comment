I might have a unique situation but i have a git annex repo that has multiple remotes for the same actual location.  I have a server at home and when i'm \"out in the world\" i use it's external IP and when i'm at home i use it's internal IP.  It appears that when i do an git annex drop on my laptop to compares and locks whichever remote is alphabetically first.  

What i'm wondering is is there a way to tell git annex which remote i want to compare against?  For example when i'm remote i want to do something like \"git annex drop . --compare remoteServer\"

Thank you!
