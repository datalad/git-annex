@zpeters, the order that remotes are accessed are ordered by cost.

You can configure the costs of remotes by setting remote.$name.annex-cost
to eg 100 to make it be checked first or 300 to make it be checked later.

There's also a remote.$name.annex-cost-command that runs a command to get
the cost. You could perhaps use that to detect which network you're on and
alter the costs appropriately.
