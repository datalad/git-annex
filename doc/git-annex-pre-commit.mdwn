# NAME

git-annex pre-commit - run by git pre-commit hook

# SYNOPSIS

git annex pre-commit `[path ...]`

# DESCRIPTION

This is meant to be called from git's pre-commit hook. `git annex init`
automatically creates a pre-commit hook using this.

Fixes up symlinks that are staged as part of a commit, to ensure they
point to annexed content.

When in a view, updates metadata to reflect changes
made to files in the view.

When in a repository that has not been upgraded to annex.version 6, 
also handles injecting changes to unlocked files into the annex.
