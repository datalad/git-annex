# NAME

git-annex calckey - calculates the key that would be used to refer to a file

# SYNOPSIS

git annex calckey `[file ...]`

# DESCRIPTION

This plumbing-level command calculates the key that would be used
to refer to a file. The file is not added to the annex by this command.
The key is output to stdout.

The backend used is the first listed in the annex.backends configuration
setting, which can be overridden by the --backend option.
For example, to force use of the SHA1 backend:

	git annex calckey --backend=SHA1 file

# OPTIONS

* `--batch`

  Enable batch mode, in which a line containing the filename is read from
  stdin, the key is output to stdout (with a trailing newline), and repeat.

* `--backend=name`

  Specifies which key-value backend to use.
