# NAME

git-annex examinekey - prints information from a key

# SYNOPSIS

git annex examinekey `[key ...]`

# DESCRIPTION

This plumbing-level command is given a key, and prints information
that can be determined purely by looking at the key.

# OPTIONS

* `--format=value`

  Use custom output formatting.

  The value is a format string, in which '${var}' is expanded to the
  value of a variable. To right-justify a variable with whitespace,
  use '${var;width}' ; to left-justify a variable, use '${var;-width}';
  to escape unusual characters in a variable, use '${escaped_var}'

  These variables are available for use in formats: key, backend,
  bytesize, humansize, keyname, hashdirlower, hashdirmixed, mtime (for
  the mtime field of a WORM key).

  Also, '\\n' is a newline, '\\000' is a NULL, etc.

* `--json`

  Enable JSON output. This is intended to be parsed by programs that use
  git-annex. Each line of output is a JSON object.

# EXAMPLES

The location a key's value is stored (in indirect mode)
can be looked up by running:

	git annex examinekey $KEY --format='.git/annex/objects/${hashdirmixed}${key}/${key}'
