# NAME

git-annex satisfy - transfer and drop content as configured

# SYNOPSIS

git annex satisffy `[path ...]`

# DESCRIPTION

This transfers and drops content to satisfy the numcopies and preferred
content settings of the local repository and remotes.

It does the same thing as `git-annex sync --content` without the pulling
and pushing of git repositories.

By default it operates on all annexed files in the current directory and
its subdirectories. Paths of files or directories can also be specified.

# OPTIONS

* `--jobs=N` `-JN`

  Enables parallel processing with up to the specified number of jobs
  running at once. For example: `-J10`

  Setting this to "cpus" will run one job per CPU core.

* `--all` `-A`

  Operate on all objects stored in the git annex, not only objects used by
  currently existing files. 
  
  However, this bypasses checking the .gitattributes annex.numcopies
  setting when dropping files.

  This is the default behavior when running git-annex in a bare repository.

* `--branch=ref`

  Operate on files in the specified branch or treeish.

  Like --all, this bypasses checking the .gitattributes annex.numcopies
  setting when dropping files.

* `--unused`

  Operate on files found by last run of git-annex unused.

* `--failed`

  Operate on files that have recently failed to be transferred.

* matching options

  The [[git-annex-matching-options]](1)
  can be used to control what files to operate on.

* `--json`

  Enable JSON output. This is intended to be parsed by programs that use
  git-annex. Each line of output is a JSON object.

* `--json-progress`

  Include progress objects in JSON output.

* `--json-error-messages`

  Messages that would normally be output to standard error are included in
  the JSON instead.

* Also the [[git-annex-common-options]](1) can be used.
