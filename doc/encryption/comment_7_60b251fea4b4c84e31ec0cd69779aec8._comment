Hi folks!

We are considering introducing git-annex with gcrypt in hybrid mode as secure storage for common data in our company and I'd rather not delete and reinit the repo everytime when somebody new is granted access.
A little testing with current git-annex showed, that GCRYPT_FULL_REPACK with a forced git-push of all branches makes the git-repo accessible (I get the files) to the newcomer but not the annexed data (gpg error \"No secret key\" in git annex get, git annex info secretRepo just lists my first key).

Has anybody sucessfully tested adding keyids in hybrid-encryption later on? Which further steps where needed to make it work? 

Thanks for any input! :)

Cheers 

Jörn
