@Yurt, git-annex will let you specify the gpg key id using anything that gpg
accepts, including a keyid with a appended '!'. However, when I tried that,
gpg seemed to still pick the master key instead of the subkey. That
happens because git-annex runs the input through `gpg --list-public-keys`
(in order to convert eg, email addresses to key ids)
which always lists the master key even when given a subkey.

I made a small change to git-annex to special case this '!' suffix
behavior. Seems to work in my very limited testing.

Please file bug reports about this kind of thing!
