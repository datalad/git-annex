@Giovanni, git is complaining that there is already a remote named
"myremote" enabled in the current repository. Perhaps you have reused this
name for a different remote.

(This seems to have nothing to do with the page the comment was posted to, which 
is a bit annoying. Please post questions in the forum and not attached to
random other pages.)
