Is it possible to encrypt with subkeys. I have a few subkeys distributed to different computers and I'd like to be able to sync to a special remote with all of them. Right now, if the master key is stripped, I get an error from gpg.

I do this exact thing with password-store. Appending \"!\" to the subkey id should force gpg to use that specific key: [https://lists.zx2c4.com/pipermail/password-store/2014-September/001131.html](https://lists.zx2c4.com/pipermail/password-store/2014-September/001131.html).
