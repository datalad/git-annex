@gavinwahl, it's a single shared key that any clone of the repository
provides access to.

If you use the [[tahoe]] special remote, storing files in tahoe-lafs does result
in a new capability (a kind of key) being stored in the git repo.
So someone with an old clone can't access the files from tahoe-lafs.
Tahoe is unique in providing that ability.
