 subject="Why is the default HMACSHA1 for shared encryption?"

I see that the shared encryption seems to use HMACSHA1 as the default.
The https://git-annex.branchable.com/backends/ page indicates that SHA256E is the default backend used for the unencrypted key value store.

Is there a reason why the default for shared encryption is not HMACSHA256 to match the default used by unencrypted repos?

Does using HMACSHA1 present any caveats?
I imagine something like collisions more likely with the older hashing algorithm.
However, I don't know enough about how it works to make a good judgement on that.

Any insight is appreciated.

Thanks
