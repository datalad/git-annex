# My TODO items

- implement p2p for annex with iroh: https://git-annex.branchable.com/todo/generic_p2p_socket_transport/#comment-de273c852db02cb46a6bab4987429a3a
- write a tip on using git worktree to inspect the git-annex branch
  - Is there a way to filter out the directories?
- write a tip on how to deal with permission issues on ext formatted USB drives
  - works of course only on Debian and derivatives
  - use a common group defined in /usr/share/base-passwd/group.master, e.g. "floppy"
  - use setgid bit: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Setuid#SGID
  - make sure all users on all machines are part of the common group
- Collect problems with NTFS tree exports, e.g.
  - Spaces at the end in filenames
  - single quotes in filenames
  - dots?
- more experiences with ext4 encryption feature:

# Bugs that affect me

- [[todo/sharedRepository_mode_not_supported_by_git-annex]] - some pain
- [[tips/shared_git_annex_directory_between_multiple_users]]
- [[todo/support_concurrency_for_export]] (maybe nice?)
- [[todo/more_efficient_resolution_of_trivial_export_conflicts]] - endless pain!
