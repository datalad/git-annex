Hey Joey,

Just wanted to leave you a message to say I think you're cool. I'm Gen Z and just recently I am diving into the world of Open Source and its culture. I just have a lot of fascination for people like you who do great, but really magnificent thing and stay so cool about it, not in the spotlights or whatever. Believe it or not, but I found out about `git annex` from ChatGPT when I asked how I can organize multiple hard drives that I have gather over the years with a lot of duplicate files on them. I want to go to film school you see and I want to organize all the footage I have so I can do cool things with it.

Anyway it is always a breeze to come from something like ChatGPT to a corner of the internet that is so real. In a way it feels quite intimate to leave a message here on your user page of some thing that you created to explain something else you created! It gives me nostalgia to a time I never experienced.

Looking forward to learn more about you and the things you do and to figure whether git annex is a fit for me. If it is then I will make sure to tell everybody I know about it because it all looks so cool to me already.


Warm regards,
Yannick
