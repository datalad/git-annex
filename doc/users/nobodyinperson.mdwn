I use git-annex to:

- manage my research data, partly also with [DataLad](https://datalad.org)
- sync and backup personal documents
- sync media files to and from my SailfishOS phone
- sync, organise and backup a huge media collection
- experiment doing inventory management

I made a [Thunar plugin](https://gitlab.com/nobodyinperson/thunar-plugins) for git-annex, here's a [ðŸ“¹ screencast](https://fosstodon.org/@nobodyinperson/109836827575976439).

In an attempt to [#gitAnnexAllTheThings](https://fosstodon.org/tags/gitAnnexAllTheThings), I used git annex as a backend for a cli time tracker [annextimelog](https://pypi.org/project/annextimelog/). It has similarities with timewarrior but adresses many of its inconveniences.

At the [TÃ¼bix 2023](https://www.tuebix.org/) I gave a (German) git annex workshop, of which you can find a recording of the initial talk [ðŸ“¹ here in the fediverse](https://tube.tchncs.de/w/db1ec5ca-94ad-4f49-a507-2124fd699ff1) and [ðŸ“¹ here on Odysee](https://odysee.com/@nobodyinperson:6/T%C3%BCbix2023-Yann-B%C3%BCchau-git-annex:6).
