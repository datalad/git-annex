I use git-annex to:

- manage my research data
- sync and backup personal documents
- sync media files to and from my SailfishOS phone
- sync, organise and backup a huge media collection
- experiment doing inventory management

I made a [Thunar plugin](https://gitlab.com/nobodyinperson/thunar-plugins) for git-annex, here's a [ðŸ“¹ screencast](https://fosstodon.org/@nobodyinperson/109836827575976439).
