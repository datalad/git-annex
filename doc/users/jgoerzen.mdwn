Hi.  I'm John Goerzen.  I have a [homepage](https://www.complete.org/jgoerzen).  I [write a lot](https://www.complete.org/interesting-topics/) about [asynchronous networks](https://www.complete.org/asynchronous-communication/) and [offline communication](https://www.complete.org/tools-for-communicating-offline-and-in-difficult-circumstances/), especially with [NNCP](https://www.complete.org/nncp/).  I'm particularly interested in git-annex's NNCP special remote.
