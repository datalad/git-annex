# NAME

git-annex uninit - de-initialize git-annex and clean out repository

# SYNOPSIS

git annex uninit

# DESCRIPTION

Use this to stop using git annex. It will unannex every file in the
repository, and remove all of git-annex's other data, leaving you with a
git repository plus the previously annexed files.

# OPTIONS

* `--json`

  Enable JSON output. This is intended to be parsed by programs that use
  git-annex. Each line of output is a JSON object.

* `--json-error-messages`

  Messages that would normally be output to standard error are included in
  the JSON instead.

* Also the [[git-annex-common-options]](1) can be used.
