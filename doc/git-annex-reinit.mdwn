# NAME

git-annex reinit - initialize repository, reusing old UUID

# SYNOPSIS

git annex reinit `uuid|description`

# DESCRIPTION

Normally, initializing a repository generates a new, unique identifier
(UUID) for that repository. Occasionally it may be useful to reuse a
UUID -- for example, if a repository got deleted, and you're
setting it back up.

Use this with caution; it can be confusing to have two existing
repositories with the same UUID. It can lead to data loss and other
weird phenomenons. Make sure you run `git annex fsck` after changing
the UUID of a repository to make sure location tracking information is
recorded correctly.

Like `git annex init`, this attempts to enable any special remotes
that are configured with autoenable=true.
