# NAME

git-annex addcomputed - adds computed files to the repository

# SYNOPSIS

git annex addcomputed `--to=remote -- ...`

# DESCRIPTION

Adds files to the annex that are computed from input files,
using a compute special remote.

Once a file has been added to a compute remote, commands
like `git-annex get` will use it to compute the content of the file.

The syntax of this command after the `--` is up to the program that
the compute special remote is set up to run to perform the comuptation.

To see the program's usage, you can run:

    git-annex addcomputed --to=foo

Generally you will provide an input file (or files), and often also an
output filename, and additional parameters to control the computation.

There can be more than one input file that are combined to compute an
output file. And multiple output files can be computed at the same time.

Some examples of how this might look:

    git-annex addcomputed --to=x -- convert file.raw file.jpeg passes=10
    git-annex addcomputed --to=y -- compress foo --level=9
    git-annex addcomputed --to=z -- clip foo 2:01-3:00 combine with bar to baz

Note that parameters that were passed to `git-annex initremote` 
when setting up the compute special remote will be appended to the end of
the parameters provided to `git-annex addcomputed`.

# OPTIONS

* `--to=remote`

  Specify which remote will compute the files. 

  This must be a compute remote. For example, one can be
  initialized with:

    git-annex initremote photoconv type=compute \
        program=git-annex-compute-photoconv

  For details about compute remotes, and a list of some
  of the programs that are available, see
  <https://git-annex.branchable.com/special_remotes/compute/>

* `--fast`

  Adds computed files to the repository, without doing any work yet to
  compute their content.

  This implies `--unreproducible`, because even if the compute remote
  produces reproducible output, it's not available.

* `--unreproducible`, `-u`

  Indicate that the computation is not expected to be fully reproducible.
  It can vary, in ways that produce files that equivilant enough to
  be interchangeable, but are not necessarily identical.

  This is the default unless the compute remote indicates that it produces
  reproducible output.

* `--reproducible`, `-r`

  Indicate that the computation is expected to be fully reproducible.

  This is the default when the compute remote indicates that it produces
  reproducible output (except when using `--fast`).

  If a computation turns out not to be fully reproducible, then getting
  a computed file from the compute remote will later fail with a
  checksum verification error. One thing that can be done then is to use 
  `git-annex recompute --original --unreproducible`.

*  Also the [[git-annex-common-options]](1) can be used.
