## git branches

The git repository has some branches:

* `debian-stable` contains the latest backport of git-annex to Debian
  stable.
* `no-s3` disables the S3 special remote, for systems that lack the
 necessary haskell library.
* `old-monad-control` is for systems that don't have a newer monad-control
  library.
* `tweak-fetch` adds support for the git tweak-fetch hook, which has
  been proposed and implemented but not yet accepted into git.
* `ghc7.0` supports versions of ghc older than 7.4, which
  had a major change to filename encoding.
* `setup` contains configuration for this website
* `pristine-tar` contains [pristine-tar](http://kitenet.net/~joey/code/pristine-tar)
  data to create tarballs of any past git-annex release.
