The main git repository for git-annex is `git://git-annex.branchable.com/`
[[gitweb](http://source.git-annex.branchable.com/?p=source.git;a=summary)]

(You can push changes to this wiki from that anonymous git checkout.)

Other mirrors of the git repository:

* `git://git.joeyh.name/git-annex` or `https://git.joeyh.name/git/git-annex.git` [[gitweb](https://git.joeyh.name/index.cgi/git-annex.git/)]

Releases of git-annex are uploaded
[to hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/git-annex). Note that the
tarball there is not the complete git-annex source tree, but only a subset
to make cabal/stack install work. Use git to checkout the full source tree.

Some operating systems include git-annex in easily prepackaged form and
others need some manual work. See [[install]] for details.

## git branches

The git repository has some branches, including:

* `ghc7.0` is a by now very out of date branch that can be built with
  ghc 7.0.
* `debian-*-backport` contains the latest backport of git-annex.
* `setup` contains configuration for this website
