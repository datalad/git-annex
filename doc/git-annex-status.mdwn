# NAME

git-annex status - show the working tree status (deprecated)

# SYNOPSIS

git annex status `[path ...]`

# DESCRIPTION

Similar to `git status --short`, this command displays the status of the files
in the working tree. 

Show files that are not checked into git (?), deleted (D),
modified (M), added but not committed (A), and type changed/unlocked (T).

# OPTIONS

* `--ignore-submodules=when`

  This option is passed on to git status, see its man page for
  details.

* `--json`

  Enable JSON output. This is intended to be parsed by programs that use
  git-annex. Each line of output is a JSON object corresponding to a file.

* `--json-error-messages`

  Adds an "error-messages" field to the JSON that contains messages that
  would normally be output to the standard error when processing a file.

* `--json-exceptions`

  Output additional JSON objects for some exceptions that are not
  associated with a particular file.

* Also the [[git-annex-common-options]](1) can be used.
