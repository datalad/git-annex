The Download with the git-annex-install script fail, I guess because the build is failed. see: https://downloads.kitenet.net/git-annex/autobuild/arm64-ancient/

	enableremote encryption changes: FAIL (0.73s)
	./Test/Framework.hs:92:
	initremote failed with unexpected exit code (transcript follows)
	initremote baz
	git-annex: There is no security benefit to using onlyencryptcreds=yes with encryption=shared
	failed
	initremote: 1 failed

It would be grate if you could fix that. Thanks in advance.
