If you are experiencing a problem using git-annex on Android, please examine the list of [[bugs]] and add a new, detailed bug report if no-one has reported the problem. If you are not sure if you have a bug, or need help in filing a good bug report, ask for help in the [[forum]].

I have moved to [[oldcomments]] a lot of old comments about problems that may be fixed or
not (hard to tell without a bug report!) " This page cannot
scale to handle every bug report that someone wants to paste into it.
