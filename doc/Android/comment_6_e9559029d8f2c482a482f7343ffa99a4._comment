starting `git annex webapp` fails for me with (Android 12, CalyxOS):

```
CANNOT LINK EXECUTABLE \"/system/bin/app_process\": library \"libnativeloader.so\" not found: needed by main executable
failed to start web browser
```

The webapp still runs and I can connect the browser by copypaste the link.

instead trying to open the browser natively i have a bit more success with Termux:API by

    termux-open-url 'http://127.0.0.1:42005/?auth=...

This seems to be the right thing to do, unfortunally for some unknown reason it fails sometimes too, but I think thats an issue
within termux which may become fixed eventually.
