>you said before the error was \"Read-only file system\". Now you're saying it's \"Cross-device link\". I'm slightly confused.

;-)  Sorry for confusion, here are the details:

\"Read-only file system\" -- that error appeared when I started \"stock git annex\", i.e. from running /data/data/ga.androidterm/lib/lib.start.so .
Since you have suggested that it might be coming from hard linking command, I have ran that one manually, and that is when I got \"Cross-device link\" error, which suggests that hard linking is not the one at fault here.

I will try fresh build now
Cheers,
