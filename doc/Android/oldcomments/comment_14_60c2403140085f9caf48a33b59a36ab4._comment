Hi Joey -- there is success here... previous installation was \"updated\" by installing the new package without uninstalling previous one, and that apparently didn't work correctly (I didn't even have bin/ directory you mentioned).  So I have removed previous installation and reinstalled it again -- it starts now!  Thanks ;)
