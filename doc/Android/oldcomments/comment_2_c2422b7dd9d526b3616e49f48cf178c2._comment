The Android app works on many non-rooted Android systems.

The \"link busybox: Read-only file system\" means that `/data/data/ga.androidterm/lib/lib.busybox.so` cannot be hard linked to `/data/data/ga.androidterm/busybox`. That's not normal. I'd appreciate if you could provide more information on your Android device, like Android version and model number.
