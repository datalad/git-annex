Hi. What is the order the remotes are processed in? I have 10 or so special remotes and often the files are uploaded to one and then dropped from another, where doing nothing would be fine.  They all have the same group and preferred content.

I think it might be some concurrency issue (I have cron jobs running sync and I also commit manually sometimes), but I want to be sure.
