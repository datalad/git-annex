I noticed that in a test with 2 local repositories and around 2'000 files \"git annex sync\" is still very fast, but \"git annex sync --content\" takes multiple seconds. Is this avoidable?

I have a central repo and client repos. I want to copy all content to the central repo after a commit. Right now, I use \"git annex group central backup\", \"git annex wanted central standard\", and a hook that triggers \"git annex sync --content\" after each commit. Maybe there is a more efficient way to do this? Thanks for sharing thoughts.
