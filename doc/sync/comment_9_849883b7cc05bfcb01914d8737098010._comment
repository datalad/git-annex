@Dav what kind of url does the upstream remote have? Perhaps it would be sufficient to make sync skip trying to push to git:// and http[s]:// remotes. Both are unlikely to accept pushes and in the cases where they do accept pushes it would be fine to need a manual `git push`. 

Anyway, you can already configure which remotes get synced with. From the man page:

<pre>
       remote.&lt;name&gt;.annex-sync
              If set to false, prevents  git-annex  sync  (and  the  git-annex
              assistant) from syncing with this remote.
</pre>

So `git config remote.upstream.annex-sync=false`
