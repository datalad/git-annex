I too feel that syncing all remotes by default is the right thing to do, but I think it should be limited to the 'master' and 'git-annex' branch. I often create branches that I want to keep local and do not want them to be synced. But I want 'master' and 'git-annex' branches to be synced with all remotes.

So it would be nice to able to set an option to sync all branches or just the 'master' and 'git-annex' or to able to ignore some branches during git annex sync
