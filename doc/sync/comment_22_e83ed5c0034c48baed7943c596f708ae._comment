Hi,

how does \"git-annex sync --content\" transfers its file to a (regular) ssh-remote? I think it uses rsync.. Is that correct?

I want to use compression for the file transfers. Therefore, I tried in .git/config to set:

    [remote \"origin\"]
        annex-rsync-upload-options = \"--compress\"

However, it seems that this crashes the upload. The sync just seems to hang.. Is it possible to use compression for the transfer? How?
