By default, `git annex sync` will sync to all remotes, unless you specify a remote. So, I have to specify, e.g., `git annex sync origin`. I can simplify this with aliases, I suppose, but I do a lot of teaching non-programmer scientists... so it'd be nice to be able to configure this (so beginning users don't have to keep track of as many things).

Is there (or will there be) a way to do this?
