I cam upon git-annex a few months ago. I saw immidiately how it could help with some frustrations I've been having. One in particlar is keeping my vimrc in sync accross multiple locations and platforms. I finally took the time to give it a try after I finally hit my boiling point this morning. I went through the [walkthrough](http://git-annex.branchable.com/walkthrough/) and now I have an annax everywhere I need it. `git annex sync` and my vimrc is up-to-date, simply grand!

Thanks so much for making git-annex,
