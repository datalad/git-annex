git sync â€¦ >> fetches from each remote

Well, I have two git annex-ed repositories where \"git remote -v\" properly lists the other repo, and \"git annex sync foo\" manages to pull from foo, but \"git annex sync\" without a remote name simply does a local sync. Also, neither command pushes anything anywhere.

So, where does \"git annex\" get its list of remotes from? What could prevent it from accessing them?
