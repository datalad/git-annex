@Matthias, `git annex sync --content` has to check each file to see if any other repository wants it. This is necessarily going to get slow when there are a lot of files. The assistant does a similar syncing but uses some tricks to avoid scanning all the files too often, while still managing to keep them all in sync -- it can do this since it's a long-running daemon and is aware when files have changed.
