# NAME

git-annex updateproxy - update records with proxy configuration

# SYNOPSIS

git annex updateproxy

# DESCRIPTION

A git-annex repository can act as a proxy for its remotes. That allows
annexed content to be stored and removed from the proxy's remotes, by
repositories that do not have a direct connection to the remotes.

By default, no proxying is done. To configure the local repository to act
as a proxy for its remote named "foo", run `git config remote.foo.annex-proxy`
true`.

After setting or unsetting `remote.<name>.annex-proxy` git configurations,
run `git-annex updateproxy` to record the proxy configuration in the
git-annex branch. That tells other repositories about the proxy
configuration.

Suppose, for example, that remote "work" has had this command run in
it. Then after pulling from "work", git-annex will know about an
additional remote, "work-foo". That remote will be accessed using "work" as
a proxy. (This only works for remotes accessed over ssh.)
