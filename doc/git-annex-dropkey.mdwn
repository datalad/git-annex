# NAME

git-annex dropkey - drops annexed content for specified keys

# SYNOPSIS

git annex dropkey `[key ...]`

# DESCRIPTION

This plumbing-level command drops the annexed data for the specified
keys from this repository.

This can be used to drop content for arbitrary keys, which do not need
to have a file in the git repository pointing at them.

Warning: This command does not check that enough other copies of the content
exist; using it can easily result in data loss.

# OPTIONS

* `--batch`

  Enables batch mode, in which lines containing keys to drop are read from
  stdin.

* `--json`

  Enable JSON output. This is intended to be parsed by programs that use
  git-annex. Each line of output is a JSON object.
