# NAME

git-annex dropkey - drops annexed content for specified keys

# SYNOPSIS

git annex dropkey `[key ...]`

# DESCRIPTION

This plumbing-level command drops the annexed data for the specified
keys from this repository.

This can be used to drop content for arbitrary keys, which do not need
to have a file in the git repository pointing at them.

Warning: This command does not check that enough other copies of the content
exist; using it can easily result in data loss.

# OPTIONS

* `--batch`

  Enables batch mode, in which lines containing keys to drop are read from
  stdin.

* `--json`

  Enable JSON output. This is intended to be parsed by programs that use
  git-annex. Each line of output is a JSON object corresponding to a key
  being processed.

* `--json-error-messages`

  Adds an "error-messages" field to the JSON that contains messages that
  would normally be output to the standard error when processing a key.

* `--json-exceptions`

  Output additional JSON objects for some exceptions that are not
  associated with a particular key.


* Also the [[git-annex-common-options]](1) can be used.
