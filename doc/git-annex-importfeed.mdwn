# NAME

git-annex importfeed - import files from podcast feeds

# SYNOPSIS

git annex importfeed `[url ...]`

# DESCRIPTION

Imports the contents of podcast feeds. Only downloads files whose
content has not already been added to the repository before, so you can
delete, rename, etc the resulting files and repeated runs won't duplicate
them.

When quvi is installed, links in the feed are tested to see if they
are on a video hosting site, and the video is downloaded. This allows
importing e.g., youtube playlists.

To make the import process add metadata to the imported files from the feed,
`git config annex.genmetadata true`

# OPTIONS

* `--force`

  Force downloading items it's seen before.

* `--template`

  Controls where the files are stored.

  The default template is '${feedtitle}/${itemtitle}${extension}'
  
  Other available variables for templates: feedauthor, itemauthor, itemsummary, itemdescription, itemrights, itemid, itempubdate, title, author

* `--relaxed`, `--fast`, `--raw`

  These options behave the same as when using [[git-annex-addurl]](1).
