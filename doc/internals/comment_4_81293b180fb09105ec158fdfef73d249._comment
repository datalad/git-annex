can `.git/annex/tmp` be used by third party software to import stuff in git-annex? the idea here would be to accept uploads from a web form in `.git/annex/tmp` then move it into place in the proper location once the upload is complete (then do a git-annex-add or let the assistant import it). --[[anarcat]]
