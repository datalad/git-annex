I've audited the code and the only place I could find where it did not work
to have othertmp on a different filesystem is in the bittorrent special
remote when it downloads a torrent file. But that also failed when
`.git/annex/tmp` was on a different filesystem! (Since it was moving between
the two directories.) I've fixed that.

It's still best to keep things on the same filesystem because
cross-filesystem moves can be expensive and it sometimes falls back to less
ideal behavior in other ways too when operating across filesystems. Also
of course, you avoid being the one who gets to find and report breakage
like the above..
