I'm using a git-annex to store build artefacts on a remote bare repo. Some of these artefacts are used in subsequent builds, which clone the artefacts repo, and use 'git annex get' to retrieve the artefacts of interest. 

Unfortunately, I've had to add a little kludge along the following lines to my build script fragment:

    git annex get ${file}
    find .git/annex/objects -type d -exec chmod +w {} \;

This is necessary because I need to ensure that the cloned git repo is able to be deleted at all times (I'm using yocto/openembedded and it may want to delete the clone for a variety of reasons).
