I think that the annex.freezecontent-command approach is fine. The hook
runs after git-annex changes permissions, and it can add them back if you
want. It is supported since 8.20210630

I agree it would be better if gitolite could be modified to only set the
write bits before deleting the repository. It seems to me that gitolite
demonstratably has a bug, because you show it fail to delete everything but
apparently behave as if it succeeded. Perhaps setting the write bits 
could be justified to the gitolite developers as a way to make it more robust
when removing a repository, in case some permission problem prevents deleting
the content of a directory.
