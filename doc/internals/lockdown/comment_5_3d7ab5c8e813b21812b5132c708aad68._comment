Thanks for your time and your advice, joey. We'll stick with the hook for now then.

I realized I didn't include versions: on my gitolite server I have git-annex 10.20220504. However, that's only because I hacked the environment up so I could use the [conda-forge](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/git-annex) build as the system git-annex. Because the version in Ubuntu 22.04 is 8.20210223.

That's not really a stable way to run a system, so I am leaning towards reverting and just living with the bug for a while.
