Some documentation that would be nice having added in the appropriate places:

* Exactly how is the index file being used? Is this just a copy of the git index file that we would get when checking out the git-annex branch? Why is the file kept around? Which sort of operations are done on the index, e.g. when doing git annex add?

* For all time-stamped data-structures: Exactly which significance does the time-stamp have? E.g., for uuid.log, is this the date the name was changed?
