Joey, you said

> .git/annex/othertmp has to be on the same filesystem as the work tree and git repository.

is that for atomic/quick renames important for adjusted branch unlocked mode?  asking because in datalad we have that \"wreckless\" mode where we symlink an entire `.git/annex` from original clone to e.g. have quick throw away clone to access the data and possibly even without modifying state of any annexed key.

Or how else are we stepping on the shovel here?
