There should be no obstacles to using direct mode on one clone of a git repository, and indirect mode on another clone. The data stored in git for either mode is identical, and I do this myself for some repositories.

@valhalla, you probably need to run `git annex fsck`, and if that does not solve your problem, you need to file a bug report.
