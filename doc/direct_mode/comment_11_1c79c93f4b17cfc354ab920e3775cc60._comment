I too have issues with mixing direct and indirect mode repositories.

 I have a regular, existing repository with ebooks, shared between various clones on proper :) filesystems; now I would need a copy of some of them on an ereader which only offers a FAT filesystem, so it has to be direct mode.

    mount $READER
    cd $reader
    git clone $REPO

I get a directory full of small files, the way git manages links on FAT.

    git annex init \"ebook reader\"

This detects the fact that it is working on a crippled filesystem, enables direct mode and disables ssh connection caching; up to now everything seems to be fine, but then

    git annex get $SOME_BOOK

seems to work, downloads the file somewhere, but when I try to open $SOME_BOOK it is still the fake link, and the file has been downloaded in its destination, as if the repo wasn't in direct mode.

I use version 4.20130723 on debian jessie
