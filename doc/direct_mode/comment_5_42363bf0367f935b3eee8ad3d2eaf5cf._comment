What happens to the object database (`.git/annex/objects`) when going to direct mode? Are the objects deleted, moved to another location, kept?

If the objects are kept, does it means that the file on the repository in direct mode is duplicated in the object database? If so, would it be relevant to use `cp --reflink=auto` to populate the working directory to enable copy on write on filesystems that supports it?
