How does the preferred content settings interfere with the numcopies setting?

I could not get behind it. E.g. a case I do not unterstand:

I have a preferred setting evaluating to true and still 

    git annex get --auto

does nothing, if the number of copies produced would surpass the numcopies setting.


Thx
