Could you clarify how the _default_ (empty) preferred content setting works? Is it equivalent to `anything`, or more magical than that?

(Asking because I noticed that `annex find --in . --want-drop` in such a repo matches basically all files, even the ones that `annex sync --content` just retrieved. Likewise, it retrieves files while `annex find --not --in . --want-get` lists nothing. I'm fine with the sync behavior here, but somewhat worried that a _future_ `annex sync --content` would actually decide to drop everything... I'm running 6.20160126 with numcopies=1.)

Also, what happens if I use `standard` for a repo that's not in any group?
