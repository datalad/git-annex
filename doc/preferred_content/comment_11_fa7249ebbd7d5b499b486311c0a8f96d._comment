@grawity, the empty (or unset) preferred content setting causes a default behavior to
be used. What the default is varies depending on what you're doing. For
example, if you're running `git annex drop --auto`, it defaults to dropping
everything when there's no preferred content setting. On the other hand,
`git annex sync --content` defaults to getting everything. So, this is
diffent than using "anything".

If you use "standard" and the repo is not in exactly one of the standard
groups, it behaves the same as if you'd given it an unparseable preferred
content setting. It will want all files it has and none it doesn't have.
