Is there a way to drop only the files that are located in an \"archive\" directory?
I want to drop all files when calling

    git annex drop --auto

if I move them to the archive. But I want to keep the files that are outside of the archive, even if they are already present in other repos. As far as I have seen and tested, as soon as I have the files in an other repo all files get dropped, also the ones outside the archive directory. Or do I have to increase \"numcopies\" in order to circumvent the \"(not copies=semitrusted+:1)\" case?
