# NAME

git-annex updatecluster - update records of cluster nodes

# SYNOPSIS

git-annex updatecluster

# DESCRIPTION

This command is used to record the nodes of a cluster in the git-annex
branch.

It looks at the git configs `git config remote.name.annex-cluster-node` of
each remote. When that is set to the name of a cluster that has been
initialized with `git-annex initcluster`, the node will be recorded in the
git-annex branch.

To remove a node from a cluster, unset `remote.name.annex-cluster-node`
and run this command.
