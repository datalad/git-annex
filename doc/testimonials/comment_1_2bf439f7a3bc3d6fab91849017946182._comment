I am in the process of building a distributed digital repository using Git and git-annex as a foundation. Our project is to collect and preserve archival-quality audio and video from multiple bandwidth-challenged remote sites. We're using git-annex to help us sneakernet the metadata and binaries around and to maintain multiple copies in geographically separate locations. Git very neatly addresses the problem of tracking changes, while git-annex makes it possible to track the flow of information through a network of distributed repositories.
