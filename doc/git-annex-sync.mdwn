# NAME

git-annex sync - synchronize local repository with remotes

# SYNOPSIS

git annex sync `[remote ...]`

# DESCRIPTION

This command synchronizes the local repository with its remotes.

This command first commits any local changes to files that have
previously been added to the repository. Then it does the equivilant of
[[git-annex-pull]](1) followed by [[git-annex-push]](1).

However, unlike those commands, this command does not transfer annexed
content by default. That will change in a future version of git-annex,
when syncing with repositories that have preferred content configured.

# OPTIONS

* `--content`, `--no-content`, `-g`

  The --content option causes the content of annexed files
  to also be pulled and pushed.

  The --no-content and -g options cause the content of annexed files to
  not be pulled and pushed.

  The `annex.synccontent` configuration can be set to true to make
  `--content` be enabled by default.

* `--content-of=path` `-C path`

  This option causes the content of annexed files in the given
  path to also be pulled and pushed.

  This option can be repeated multiple times with different paths.

  Note that this option does not prevent exporting other files to an 
  "exporttree=yes" remote.

* `--commit`, `--no-commit`

  A commit is done by default (unless `annex.autocommit` is set to false).
  
  Use --no-commit to avoid committing local changes.

* `--message=msg` `-m msg`

  Use this option to specify a commit message.

* `--pull`, `--no-pull`

  Use this option to disable pulling.

  When `remote.<name>.annex-sync` is set to false, pulling is disabled
  for that remote, and using `--pull` will not enable it.

* `--push`, `--no-push` 

  Use this option to disable pushing.
  
  When `remote.<name>.annex-sync` is set to false, pushing is disabled for
  that remote, and using `--push` will not enable it.

* Also all options supported by [[git-annex-pull]](1) and
  [[git-annex-push]](1) can be used.

* Also the [[git-annex-common-options]](1) can be used.
