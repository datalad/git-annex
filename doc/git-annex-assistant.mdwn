# NAME

git-annex assistant - automatically sync changes

# SYNOPSIS

git annex assistant

# DESCRIPTION

Watches for changes to files in the current directory and its subdirectories,
and automatically syncs them to other remotes.

# OPTIONS

* `--autostart`

  Automatically starts the assistant running in each repository listed
  in the file `~/.config/git-annex/autostart`

  This is typically started at boot, or when you log in.

* `--startdelay=N`

  Wait N seconds before running the startup scan. This process can
  be expensive and you may not want to run it immediately upon login.

  When --autostart is used, defaults to --startdelay=5.

* `--foreground`

  Avoid forking to the background.

* `--stop`

  Stop a running daemon in the current repository.

* `--autostop`

  The complement to --autostart; stops all running daemons in the
  repositories listed in the autostart file.
