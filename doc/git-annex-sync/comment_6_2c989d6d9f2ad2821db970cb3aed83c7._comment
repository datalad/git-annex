I'm a bit confused by what is mentioned in this page:
> To make working with such non-bare remotes easier, sync pushes not only local master to remote master, but also to remote synced/master

but just above it's explained that by default Git does not allow to push to remote master:
> Syncing with a non-bare remote will not normally update the remote's current branch with changes from the local repository.

In addition the page https://git-annex.branchable.com/sync/ doesn't mention that the remote master branch is directly synchronized:
> When you run git annex sync [...] Finally, it updates synced/master to reflect the new state of master, and pushes it out to each of the remotes.

So I was wondering about the correctness of the first cited sentence.
