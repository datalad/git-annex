Help make git-annex better!

## wiki gardening

This website is a wiki, so you can edit and improve any page.

Or, write a [[new_tip|tips]] explaining how to accomplish something with
git-annex.

## bug triage

People often file [[bugs]] on git-annex that are easily resolved by helping
them with a problem, and perhaps writing some documentation.

Many bugs are also filed without enough information
to reproduce the problem, and need to be tagged moreinfo and a comment
posted asking the submitter for details.

Joey spends a lot of time dealing with this kind of bug triage. If you can
take the time to pick a bug from the list of
[[unconfirmed_bugs|bugs/unconfirmed]], try to reproduce it and follow up either
confirming that the problem exists, or asking the submitter for more info,
you'll make Joey more productive!

## code contributions

[[download]] the source code and send patches!

If you know Haskell, git-annex has lots of Haskell code that
could be improved. See the [[coding_style]] and have at it.

If you don't know Haskell, git-annex has many other coding opportunities.
You could work to improve the Android port (Java etc) or improve the
Javascript and CSS of the git-annex webapp, or work on porting libraries
needed by the Windows port.

To send patches, either include the patch in a bug report (small patch)
or put up a branch in a git repository containing your changes.
