# NAME

git-annex init - initialize git-annex

# SYNOPSIS

git annex init `[description]`

# DESCRIPTION

Until a repository (or one of its remotes) has been initialized,
git-annex will refuse to operate on it, to avoid accidentally
using it in a repository that was not intended to have an annex.

It's useful, but not mandatory, to initialize each new clone
of a repository with its own description. If you don't provide one,
one will be generated using the username, hostname and the path.

If any special remotes were configured with autoenable=true,
this will also attempt to enable them. See [[git-annex-initremote]](1).
To disable this, re-enable a remote with "autoenable=false", or
mark it as dead (see [[git-annex-dead]](1)).

This command is entirely safe, although usually pointless, to run inside an
already initialized git-annex repository.

# OPTIONS

* `--version=N`

  Force the repository to be initialized using a different annex.version
  than the current default.
