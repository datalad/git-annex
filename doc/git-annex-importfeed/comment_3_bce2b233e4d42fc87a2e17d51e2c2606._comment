I just thought it was surprising behavior, especially when ```git-annex addurl --file 123-45.ext $url``` preserves the dash in the filename, yet the rss I constructed to add multiple urls, with files, didn't do this.

The new ```--batch --with-files``` options to addurl will eliminate the need to create specially crafted rss files.

Thanks! :)
