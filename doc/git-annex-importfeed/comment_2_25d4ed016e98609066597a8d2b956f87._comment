All spaces and punctuation (other than '.') and other wacky stuff are replaced with
'_' when git-annex builds a filename from some untrusted source like a
feed.

I think it makes sense to do that even for '-', at least if it's at the
start of a filename. "--force" is not a filename you want to let a feed
inject into your work tree. I could perhaps be convinced to let '-'
elsewhere in the filename through unmunged, but simplicity and consistency
suggests it's just as good to always munge it.
