At [Distribits 2025](https://distribits.live/), there were several talks on
git-annex and closely related subjects.

Joey Hess's talk 
["git-annex for computer scientists"](https://www.distribits.live/talks/2025/hess-git-annex-for-computer-scientists/)
explained the core data structures that make up git-annex, and then
used that as a basis to understand several recent git-annex features.

Steffen Vogel's talk
["Managing Tape Archives with git-annex: A Special Remote for Sequential Media"](https://www.distribits.live/talks/2025/vogel-managing-tape-archives-with-git-annex/)
presented a soon to be released special remote for LTO tape, breaking new
ground in what git-annex can use.

Matthias Riße's talk
["Forgejo-aneksajo: a git-annex/DataLad forge"](https://www.distribits.live/talks/2025/risse-forgejo-aneksajo-a-git-annex-datalad-forge/)
covered this increasingly important integration between git-annex and
forgejo, and how it is developed and maintained.

The above three speakers were in
a [panel discussion](https://www.distribits.live/talks/2025/discussion-hess-vogel-szczepanik-risse/) as well.

Michał Szczepanik's talk
["Compute on demand"](https://www.distribits.live/talks/2025/szczepanik-compute-on-demand/)
compared and contrasted the git-annex compute special remote with 
the datalad-remake special remote.

Timothy Sanders's talk
["Using Git-annex to enhance the MediaWiki file repository system"](https://www.distribits.live/talks/2025/sanders-using-git-annex-to-enhance-the/)

Christopher Markiewicz's talk
["Maintaining large datasets at scale"](https://www.distribits.live/talks/2025/markiewicz-maintaining-large-datasets-at-scale/)
