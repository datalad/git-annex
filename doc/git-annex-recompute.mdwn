# NAME

git-annex recompute - update computed files

# SYNOPSIS

git-annex recompute [path ...]`

# DESCRIPTION

This updates computed files that were added with
[[git-annex-addcomputed]](1).

By default, this only recomputes files whose input files have changed.
The new contents of the input files are used to re-run the computation,
and when the output is different, the updated computed file is staged
in the repository.

# OPTIONS

* `--unchanged`

  Recompute files even when their input files have not changed.

* `--unreproducible`

  Convert files that were added with `git-annex addcomputed --reproducible`
  to be as if they were added without that option.

* `--reproducible`

  Convert files that were added with `git-annex addcomputed --unreproducible`
  to be as if they were added with `--reproducible`.

* matching options

  The [[git-annex-matching-options]](1) can be used to control what
  files to recompute.

  For example, to only recompute files that are computed by the "photoconv"
  compute remote, use `--in=photoconv`

*  Also the [[git-annex-common-options]](1) can be used.
