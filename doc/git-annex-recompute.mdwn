# NAME

git-annex recompute - recompute computed files

# SYNOPSIS

git-annex recompute [path ...]`

# DESCRIPTION

This updates computed files that were added with
[[git-annex-addcomputed]](1). 

When the output of the computation is different, the updated computed
file is staged in the repository.

By default, this only recomputes files whose input files have changed.
The new contents of the input files are used to re-run the computation.

# OPTIONS

* `--original`

  Use the original content of input files.

* `--others`

  When recomputing one file also generates new versions of other files,
  stage those other files in the repository too.

* `--unreproducible`, `-u`

  Convert files that were added with `git-annex addcomputed --reproducible`
  to be as if they were added without that option.

* `--reproducible`, `-r`

  Convert files that were added with `git-annex addcomputed --unreproducible`
  to be as if they were added with `--reproducible`.

* `--remote=name`

  Only recompute files that were computed by this compute remote.

  When this option is not used, all computed files are recomputed using
  whatever compute remote was originally used to add them. In cases where
  a file can be computed by multiple remotes, the one with the lowest
  configured cost will be used.

* matching options

  The [[git-annex-matching-options]](1) can be used to control what
  files to recompute.

*  Also the [[git-annex-common-options]](1) can be used.
