# NAME

git-annex dead - hide a lost repository or key

# SYNOPSIS

git annex dead `[repository ...] [--key key]`

# DESCRIPTION

This command exists to deal with situations where data has been lost,
and you know it has, and you want to stop being reminded of that fact.

When a repository is specified, indicates that the repository has
been irretrievably lost, so it will not be listed in eg, `git annex info`.
Repositories can be specified using their remote name, their
description, or their UUID. (To undo, use `git-annex semitrust`.)

When a key is specified, indicates that the content of that key has been
irretrievably lost. This prevents commands like `git annex fsck --all`
from complaining about it; `--all` will not operate on the key anymore.
(To undo, add the key's content back to the repository, 
by using eg, `git-annex reinject`.)
