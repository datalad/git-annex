# NAME

git-annex copy - copy content of files to/from another repository

# SYNOPSIS

git annex copy `[path ...] [--from=remote|--to=remote]`

# DESCRIPTION

Copies the content of files from or to another remote.

With no parameters, operates on all annexed files in the current directory.
Paths of files or directories to operate on can be specified.

# OPTIONS

* `--from=remote`

  Copy the content of files from the specified
  remote to the local repository.
  
  Any files that are not available on the remote will be silently skipped.

* `--to=remote`

  Copy the content of files from the local repository
  to the specified remote.

* `--to=here`

  Copy the content of files from all reachable remotes to the local
  repository.

* `--jobs=N` `-JN`

  Enables parallel transfers with up to the specified number of jobs
  running at once. For example: `-J10`

  Setting this to "cpus" will run one job per CPU core.

* `--auto`

  Rather than copying all specified files, only copy those that don't yet have
  the desired number of copies, or that are preferred content of the
  destination repository. See [[git-annex-preferred-content]](1)

* `--fast`

  When copying content to a remote, avoid a round trip to check if the remote
  already has content. This can be faster, but might skip copying content
  to the remote in some cases.

* `--all` `-A`

  Rather than specifying a filename or path to copy, this option can be
  used to copy all available versions of all files.

  This is the default behavior when running git-annex in a bare repository.

* `--branch=ref`

  Operate on files in the specified branch or treeish.

* `--unused`

  Operate on files found by last run of git-annex unused.

* `--failed`

  Operate on files that have recently failed to be transferred.

* `--key=keyname`

  Use this option to copy a specified key.

* file matching options

  The [[git-annex-matching-options]](1)
  can be used to specify files to copy.

* `--batch`

  Enables batch mode, in which lines containing names of files to copy
  are read from stdin.

  As each specified file is processed, the usual progress output is
  displayed. If a file's content does not need to be copied, or it does not
  match specified matching options, or it is not an annexed file,
  a blank line is output in response instead.

  Since the usual output while copying a file is verbose and not
  machine-parseable, you may want to use --json in combination with
  --batch.

* `-z`

  Makes the `--batch` input be delimited by nulls instead of the usual
  newlines.

* `--json`

  Enable JSON output. This is intended to be parsed by programs that use
  git-annex. Each line of output is a JSON object.

* `--json-progress`

  Include progress objects in JSON output.

* `--json-error-messages`

  Messages that would normally be output to standard error are included in
  the json instead.
