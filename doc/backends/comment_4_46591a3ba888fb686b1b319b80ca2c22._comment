I'd really like to have a SHA256e backend -- same as SHA256E but making sure that extensions of the files in .git/annex are converted to lower case.  I normally try to convert filenames from cameras etc to lower case, but not all people that I share annex with do so consistently.
In my use case, I need to be able to find duplicates among files and .jpg vs .JPG throws git annex dedup off.  Otherwise E backends are superior to non-E for me.  Thanks, Michael.
