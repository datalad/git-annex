Aha, this is a path propel to the trustedkeys.gpg file, it's in bundle/
in the OSX app, and git-annex tells gpg to look in the parent directory
instead.

Fixed in git. Unfortunately I can't fix old versions of git-annex so
OSX users will need to manually upgrade to version 5.20150522 to get this
fix.
