I think that the most important use case for a cluster is 
that it lets you make a single upload of a file and let the cluster decide
which nodes to store it on.
Rather than needing to upload several times to different repositories.

Being able to `git-annex drop foo --from cluster` and remove it from whichever
nodes the cluster happens to be storing it on is also a convenient use case.

Another use case is letting the cluster operator provide access to some
resource that you can't directly access. (Although that is really a property
of proxies more generally.) Eg, a cluster node could be a S3 bucket that
only the cluster operator has credentials to access.

So it's an abstraction, but it's intentionally a leaky one; you can still
access specific nodes of a cluster individually via the cluster gateway. Eg
you can use "cluster-node1" as a remote. But also, with physical access,
you could pull that node1 drive out of the cluster, make it a regular
remote, and git-annex will know what files are on it. And when you put it
back in the cluster, it will know what changes you made to it. And when you
consider that situation, I think it makes sense why the contents of each
node are tracked individually:, which is why node counts as its own copy.

It's also possible that git-annex will eventually not be limited to
"1 repository is 1 copy" more generally.
[[todo/repositories_that_count_as_more_than_one_copy]] is pondering
that, and has some other cases than clusters where it may make sense,
to some people, to have a repository be treated as more than 1 copy.
