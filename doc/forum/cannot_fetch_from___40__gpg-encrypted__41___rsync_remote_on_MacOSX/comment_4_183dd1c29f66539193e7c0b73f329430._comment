I recently encountered this problem on OSX, and I'm pretty sure I fixed it. But I don't remember the details of how. I'm sorry I don't have more detail, but I recommend trying a newer version of git-annex. 

And if the problem persists, --debug will show the git commands and should help identify the one that's being passed bad parameters.
