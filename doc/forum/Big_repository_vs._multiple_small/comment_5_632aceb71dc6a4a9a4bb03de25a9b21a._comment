Thanks!

But what to my question regarding checking out a repository within a repository?

I will most likely have a \"home\" repository which I would check out at first level.

Then, within one directory I would like to (only locally!) check out another, such as \"Library\".

Something like mount ... to mount one FS within another mount point.

For SVN I think there exist externals for that ...

Does this work?
