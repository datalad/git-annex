Thank you, that's a good point!

Does this also mean that a repository in git(-annex) is \"all or nothing\"?

For example, I cannot share/clone parts of it? Or define access rights within a repository?

With SVN for example, I have a big repository \"university\" and it contains all stuff of projects/research. Each individual directory is only shared with the persons whom I worked together in this particular project. In short: In git, this should not be that way, right?
