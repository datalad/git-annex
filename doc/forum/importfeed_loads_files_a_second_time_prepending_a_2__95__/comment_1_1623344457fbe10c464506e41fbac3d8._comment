RSS feeds have unique IDs that are attached to a post in the feed.
They are supposed to be allocated once and remain unchanged. It's not
entirely uncommon for the unique IDs to change (due to broken feed
generation software, changing feed generation software, etc), and then git-annex
thinks this is a new file in the feed, that happens to have the same
title as another file, so it makes up a unique name for it with the "2_".

Since the alternative is to miss downloading new files from the RSS feed
if they happen to have the same title as a previous file, I think we have
to live with this.

(git-annex was improved in version 5.20150727 to avoid some cases
of this)
