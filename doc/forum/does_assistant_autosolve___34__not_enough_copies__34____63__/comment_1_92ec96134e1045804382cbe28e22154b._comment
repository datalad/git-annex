The assistant only sends files to repositories that want them. This is not
guaranteed to make as many copies of the files as whatever you have
numcopies configured to. (Numcopies will prevent the assistant from
dropping a file from a repository if there are not enough copies.)

All of your archive repositories only want 1 copy of a file across all of
them, so you would need 2 backup repositories (which want all files) in
order to get to 3 copies.
