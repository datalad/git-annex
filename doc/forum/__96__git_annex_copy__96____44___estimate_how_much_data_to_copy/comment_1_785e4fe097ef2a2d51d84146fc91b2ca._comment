Using `git annex info .` in combination with the
[[git-annex-matching-options]] is a good way to do such queries.

The "size of annexed files in working tree" line gives the total size of
the files that match that query.

If you're copying files to a remote, run something like:

	git annex info . --not --in $remote

And if you're getting files, run something like:

	git annex info . --not --in here
