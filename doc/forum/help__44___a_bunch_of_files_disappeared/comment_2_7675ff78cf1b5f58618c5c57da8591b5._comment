There are two possible things that could have happened.

1. Maybe something somehow wrong got committed to the git repository
   for the missing files. 
   
   If so, you can *always* use git to check out
   the older version before that commit, and will then be able to see
   the files; git-annex will know where the content of them is, etc.
   You can also use `git revert` to revert such a bad commit.

2. Maybe you accidentially dropped the content of the files with --force,
   and if so, you may have lost the content.

   If you run `git annex log` on one of the files, and look at the lines
   starting with "-", you can see when the file content was removed from
   repositories. But there's no way to get it back unless you have another
   copy somewhere.
