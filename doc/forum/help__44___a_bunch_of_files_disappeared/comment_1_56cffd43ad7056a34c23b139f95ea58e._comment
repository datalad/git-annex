oh, it might have been something dumb i did:

at some point I wanted to delete a few files, so trying to be cute I did this:

m=OneMovie.m4v git annex drop --force $m; git rm $m; git ci -m \"rm $m\"

I noted that didn't work, but didn't realize it might've taken out most/all the files in the folder
