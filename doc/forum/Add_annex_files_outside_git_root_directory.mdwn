Hi,

I love the idea of git-annex, and I'm trying to do my first steps with it. I'm stuck on the following issue:

When creating a git repository and annexing a file in the root directory, everything works as expected:

    git init
    git annex init "mytest"
    echo 1 > annexfile
    git annex add annexfile
    # add annexfile ok
    # (Recording state in git...)

However, when I try to add a file in a subdirectory of the repository, the adding command fails without any error message:

    mkdir mydir
    echo 1 > mydir/myfile
    git annex add mydir/myfile
    # no message, no status change, nothing
    # note that I can add the file in the root dir and then move it to `mydir`

Am I doing something wrong here?

Thank you!
