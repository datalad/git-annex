I guess I can `git annex sync --content && git annex get --auto` to make sure I get the content I want. Although at that point, it's probably better to do `git annex sync && git annex get --auto && git annex drop --auto`. I was expecting `sync` to handle the auto get/drop - which it usually does. But it silently passes even when it doesn't get the wanted content.

Perhaps I should think of `sync` as a \"best effort\" mode? That is, it will download available content, but I shouldn't rely on it to download all wanted content - `get` is the job for that.
