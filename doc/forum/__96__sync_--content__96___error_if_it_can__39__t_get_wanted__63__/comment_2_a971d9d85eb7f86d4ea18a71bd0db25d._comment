The rationelle for this difference is that 
with `git-annex get` you are explicitly asking it to get
the specified files (or all files), while with `git-annex sync --content`
you are asking it to make the local and remote be in sync with respect to
whether they contain the content or not. When neither local nor remote
contains the content, they are still in sync..
