At some point in testing I did a `drop --force` and have no more copies of these files.

When I run `get -A` I get a report that they can't be found, which makes sense. So, I don't need git annex telling me that every time.

I tried `git annex dead -- SHA256E-s70539--3da7e5e584997ad3f8c5cc995025cffb4f0521763bd75be3c8f5e20e2811a0b7.RPP` and it says "ok" but they still show up in `get -A`.

How can I make annex forget these keys ever existed?

$ git annex get -A
