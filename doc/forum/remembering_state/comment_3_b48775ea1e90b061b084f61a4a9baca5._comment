While you can certianly use views for this, I tend to do the same with my sound files without view, but just using location tracking info. I have a set of music I'm currently listening to, and want to have more or less the same files on multiple computers as I have on my laptop. With maybe a bit more on some computers with more space. So, I do:

    git annex sync
    git annex get --in darkstar

Where \"darkstar\" is the name of the repository on my laptop. 

Another nice trick that also takes advantage of the location tracking logs is this to get back some files you dropped temporarily to free up space:

    git annex get --in='here@{yesterday}'
