It doesn't make sense for the git-annex assistant to try to somehow detect and mount drives. Every OS has its own way to do that.

The assistant simply detects drives that have been mounted by the OS.

There is absolutely no problem with manually setting up a git repository on a removable drive and using it with the assistant. This is identical to what the assistant would set up for an external drive (except perhaps being a non-bare repository). The assistant simply detects if any git remote whose url is a directory is inside a mount point when it sees a new device be mounted.
