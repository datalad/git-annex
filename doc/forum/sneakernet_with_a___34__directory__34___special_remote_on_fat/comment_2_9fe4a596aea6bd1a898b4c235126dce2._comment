The directory= parameter to enableremote only affects the local
configuration of that remote, it's not stored anywhere. Which is why you
have to pass that parameter each time you're enabling that same
directory remote in different repositories.

So, it's fine to have directory= set to different values in different
repositories, or even to re-run enableremote with a new directory= setting
as needed.
