I have an existing repo on my local machine, with a mirror that I sync on the flash drive as well, using a remote, as described in the walkthrough. I'd like to create another repo on my remote server and have that work as a mirror as well, using ssh and rsync too. The only resources I've found regarding creating a remote over ssh imply that the repo is already on the host, is this a necessary step in creating a ssh remote? I was thinking in the terms of creating a git annex repository, adding a remote, then pushing it much like how git works, yet I can't find anything like that in the documentation.
