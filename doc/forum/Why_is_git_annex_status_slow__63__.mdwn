It seems that `git annex status` is much slower than `git status`, at least in direct mode. The man page does not give any hint about why it should be slower.

Does `git annex status` do something that `git status` does not?

Here is an example in a repo with 8000+ files in direct mode and with no modified files:


    $ time git -c core.bare=false status --porcelain > /dev/null

    real   0m0.096s
    user   0m0.042s
    sys    0m0.071s

    $ time git annex status

    real   0m17.144s
    user   0m10.555s
    sys    0m1.934s

It is strange to see that `git annex status` is ~200 times slower than the bare `git status`.
