Hello,

I have posted a similiar (same?) problem already some weeks ago: <https://git-annex.branchable.com/forum/File_downloaded_again_and_again/> But since there has been another problem which was fixed, I dare to repost.

I have three repos: marduk (anything / archive) and horus (standard / client) and asaru (standard / client).

Whenever I do a ```git annex sync --content`` the same files are synced over and over again:

```
florian@horus ~/Documents (git)-[master] % git annex sync --content
commit  
On branch master
nothing to commit, working directory clean
ok
pull marduk 
ok
get .localized (from marduk...)

(recording state in git...)
push marduk

git annex sync --content  81,50s user 7,19s system 50% cpu 2:54,56 total
```

When I execute the same command again, the same files are synced again. On the other repos it's the same behavior.

git annex does not seem to record presence of that file:

```
florian@horus ~/Documents (git)-[master] % git annex whereis Bewerbung/thermoplast.aux
whereis Bewerbung/thermoplast.aux (1 copy) 
        f30dd4f0-5a03-4022-8f45-7c2620c4c058 -- Marduk [marduk]
ok
```

Is it a bug? Any more information I can provide?

EDIT: A pastebin of the output of a sync run without and with ```--debug```: <http://pastebin.com/raw/ad2T8jeV>

Thanks!
Florian
