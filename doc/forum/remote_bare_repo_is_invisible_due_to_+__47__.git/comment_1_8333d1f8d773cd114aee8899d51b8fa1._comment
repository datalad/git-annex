This is a desperately impactful issue. Obviously, for whatever reason, git-annex is deciding that the path to the bare remote is to a \"workarea\", and not a bare .git...

Can someone shed light on the various gates that get to this point? What's being checked in what order (are permissions checked??? is a directory test being applied???)
