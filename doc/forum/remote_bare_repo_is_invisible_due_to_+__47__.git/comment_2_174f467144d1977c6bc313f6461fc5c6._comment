Apologies... I just realised that perhaps I shouldn't have had such confidence in the version of git-annex I'm running.

On the system I'm experiencing the issue, I'm running 8.20200226-1. I had assumed that the release of Linux I was running had a a more up-to-date version.

I'm performing some upgrades, and expecting that the later version of git-annex works better. Will comment post all this.
