For my two cents, I have found git-annex to be a simple enough format that I have only needed basic helper scripts.

But many operations can be done with one or a few lines of code.

Git can do much of the heavy lifting for you in terms of looking stuff up from the git-annex branch, and I find the formats to be quite regular and easy to parse.

I am thinking of bringing some of this together into a PHP library.

But maybe I should just post my pure git-annex bash/perl one-liners.
