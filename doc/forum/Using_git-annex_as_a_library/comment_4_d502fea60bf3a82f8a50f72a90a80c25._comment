I didn't. I removed the --json options from commands that didn't necessarily output valid json when used with it. There are numerous commands that support --json (find, whereis, info, status, metadata, examinekey), and I'm open to adding it to other commands -- but it's probably not feasible to make commands like `get` output json, since their output includes progress info printed by rsync etc.
