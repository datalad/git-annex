A belated thanks for the follow-up from https://git-annex.branchable.com/forum/Using_git_annex_as_a_library/

Not that its useful for anyone here, but just FWIW after some more playing around I decided to keep things minimal and not depend on git-annex as a library. Although what I'm making naturally pairs well with git-annex it doesn't really require it, so adding the dependency just complicates things.
