There are a couple of problems with using the haskell code as a library that would need to be addressed:

* I can't guarantee much about providing every interface in a compatible way going forward. It might make sense to pick out some key interfaces and make those stable, but I don't know what the right choices would be.
* If all of git-annex is a library, `cabal build` will build everything a second time. This is annoying when trying to do a fast edit/build/test cycle, but I don't know a way to make cabal not do it. AFAIK cabal build flags cannot be used to disable building a library.
