I'm a little bit worried about the potential to reinvent SQL, badly. ;)

As shown in your example, once you have ranges, it's natural to also want disjunctions, and then probably parenthesized expressions, and suddenly things are very complicated.

Also, it's important that views remain reversable, so that committing a moved file in a view can unambiguously calculate the new metadata for it. I think that quickly becomes hard when adding these complications.
