You can set it up manually at the command line, and one it's set up, the assistant will be able to transfer files to it using rsync. See [[special_remotes/rsync]] for some setup examples. Note that the rsync server will need to be configured, somehow, to let you log in without giving a password -- one typical way this might be set up is using .ssh/authorized_keys on the rsync server.

The assistant doesn't try to set up rsync special remotes because this is not very common, and there's no one way it can use to set up a ssh key so it can log in without a password
that will work across different rsync server setups. It does support setting up rsync.net just because that's one I know how to handle.
