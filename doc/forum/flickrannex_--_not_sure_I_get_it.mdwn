flickrannex -- is it a way to upload your images to flickr by putting them in a git annex directory, and make them retrievable from it handily that way?

Or is it a hack to exploit flickr's free storage, by allowing you to somehow wrap your files in images and uploading them?

My python and knowledge of how git annex's hooks work is not good enough for me to be certain by reading the code.

Thanks
