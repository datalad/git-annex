Hello.

I'm using `git annex export` to export files to my android. It works, but sometimes I accidentally remove files from special remotes and want to get them back.
I repeat `git annex export master --to android` command, it says everything OK, but it doesn't actually transfer anything.

How to force export of a tree to existing special remote?
