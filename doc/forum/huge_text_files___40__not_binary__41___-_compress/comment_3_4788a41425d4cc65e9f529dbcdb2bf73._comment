I've tried the \"directory\" special remote with encryption=shared. It works well and I got a total size of 3.5GB while the working tree .git/annex dir has 21GB :-). The problem is: the git server of my research lab gives me a disk quota of 10GB, however, I cannot access it directly to store these files using \"directory\" special remote. Is there a way to use compression (probably through encryption) with a normal git remote?
