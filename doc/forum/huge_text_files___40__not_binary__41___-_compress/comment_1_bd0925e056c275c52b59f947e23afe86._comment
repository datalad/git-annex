The difficulty with compressing annexed files is that they have to
be available on disk in uncompressed form in order for the work tree to
point to the content of the files. Notice that, even though git does
compress .git/objects, the checked-out files in the working tree are not
themselves compressed.

git-annex does support compressing files that are stored on special
remotes. Simply enabling encryption when initializing a special remote
will also compress the data stored in it. A couple of special remotes like
bup also compress content natively.

Using a filesystem that supports compression is the only way I know of to
transparently compress files located in the working tree.
