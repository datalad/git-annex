Hi,
I'm trying to convert a v5 classic, symlink repository into a v6 always unloked repository.


I'm trying to follow along with: <http://git-annex.branchable.com/tips/unlocked_files>
but something goes wrong in the process, so I'm sure I'm missing something.
The repository is about 600G to start with on a ext4 filesystem, and I don't have another 600G of free space on disk, so I'm going with thin mode:

1.       git annex upgrade 
2.       git config annex.thin true 
3.       git annex fix 
4.       git annex unlock

It's all good to this point. Everything gets unlocked and is fine. 
Then I try to commit the changes with:

     git annex sync

The process seems to take 
and incredibly long time (several hours) and then ends up running out of space. I check the repository with "du -sh"
and it's almost double the size. Is there a reason for this? Is there a way to avoid this duplication of data. Shouldn't annex.thin do the trick?

This is also strange: with "git annex info" I get

     local annex keys: 3572
     local annex size: 933.19 gigabytes
     annexed files in working tree: 0
     size of annexed files in working tree: 0 bytes

the annex size should be about 540G and why are there no annexed files in the working tree?

Is there a correct and faster way to migrate my repo to an always unlocked one which won't require hours of time and take all that disk space?

thanks a lot, daniel
