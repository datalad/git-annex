It's pretty easy to configure ls to show broken symlinks in a different color. Run dircolors, and alias ls='ls --color==auto'. Then you can see which files are not there at a glance.

The Linux file manager's I've tried (nautilus and thunar) also shows which files are present; you get a X on the icon of annexed files that are not present.
