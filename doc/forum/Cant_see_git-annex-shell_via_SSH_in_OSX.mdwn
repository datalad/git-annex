### Sync Problems using SSH remote in OSX

- Im trying to work out SSH remotes by trying to sync up repos on my home network, following the walkthrough. 
- I have two machines (mini and mbp ) running OSX Mavericks, with RLogin enabled for all users to enable ssh.
- I can SSH into the remote machine and see *git-annex-shell*, which seems to have ok permissions

```

    johns-mbp:annex johnmccallum$ ssh john@johns-mini-5.home 
    
    Last login: Sun Apr 12 07:31:07 2015 from johns-mbp.home

    johns-mini-5:~ john$ which git-annex-shell

    /usr/local/bin/git-annex-shell

    johns-mini-5:~ john$ ls -l /usr/local/bin/git-annex-shell

    -rwxr-xr-x@ 1 john  admin  668 12 Apr 07:03 /usr/local/bin/git-annex-shell

```

- Previously on mini I created and populated a repo

``` 

    494  mkdir annex

    495  cd annex

    496  git init

    497  git annex init

    498  cp ~/Pictures/*.png .

    499  git annex add .

    500  git commit -a -m 'added png'

```

- I can git clone this repo to MBP by SSH


```
	johns-mbp:~ johnmccallum$ git clone ssh://john@johns-mini-5.home/Users/john/annex ~/annex

```

 **HOWEVER**   _git annex get_  fails as follows:

```

	johns-mbp:annex johnmccallum$ git annex get delicious.png 

	get delicious.png bash: git-annex-shell: command not found

 	 Remote origin does not have git-annex installed; setting annex-ignore

 	 This could be a problem with the git-annex installation on the remote. Please make sure that git-annex-shell is available in PATH when you ssh into the remote. Once you have fixed the git-annex installation, run: git config remote.origin.annex-ignore false
	(not available) 
 	 Try making some of these repositories available:
  		129620b2-91b1-4541-b7b1-9e5a9d31d5d3 -- john@johns-mini-5.home:~/annex
	failed
	git-annex: get: 1 failed

```

This is not the case on the remote host when I SSH in as the same user

```

    johns-mini-5:~ john$ which git-annex-shell


    /usr/local/bin/git-annex-shell

```


 The only thread on this seems to be https://git-annex.branchable.com/forum/not_finding_git-annex-shell_on_remote/ and Im at a loss to understand it.  

Any suggestions would be welcome
