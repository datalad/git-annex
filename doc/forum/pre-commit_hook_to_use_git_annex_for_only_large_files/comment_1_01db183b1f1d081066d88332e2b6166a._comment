The problem with this pre-commit hook is that by the time you run `git add
largfile`, it has copied it into the git repository. Your hook will prevent
it getting into a commit, so the repository will eventually garbage collect
the copy away, but this can take some time or manual work to do.

Recent versions of `git-annex add` will look at the annex.largefiles
configuration and if the file does not match, add it to git directly.
So that's an alternate workflow, where you `git annex add` files and let
git-annex decide whether to put them in the annex or the git repository.
