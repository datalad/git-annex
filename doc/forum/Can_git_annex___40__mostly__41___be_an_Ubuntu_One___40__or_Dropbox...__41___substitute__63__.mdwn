Hi, I tried with several git annex versions, on 3 different clients, and using 2 different remotes (an home server and box.com) and trying out different remotes setups but I've been unable to get git annex working as I expected.


I used the assistant for setup, I can sync files between clients just fine if they're connected at the same time, but if I sync a file from client A to the remotes when client B is off, and then later I turn off client A and power on client B, I've never been able to successfully sync files.

on client B, inside .git/annex/daemon.log there's nothing interesting: just messages like:

```(scanning...) [2014-06-03 14:53:26 CEST] Watcher: Performing startup scan

Already up-to-date.```

`git annex sync` just outputs

`"commit  ok"`

and `git annex list`:

XX_X steam_latest.deb
```

(they're just a bunch of random files I'm using to test it, both clients are called berdario, soloud is the home server (currently down) and the other working remote is box.com)

As you can see the russian wikibooks html file is successfully synced with the remotes, but client B is unable to see it...

I tried to set the remotes as incremental backup, full backup, transfer, client (!?) but none of these settings work.

Is git annex not what I'm looking for? Is it supposed to work only on contemporarily connected clients?

Thanks
