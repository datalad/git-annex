Hi,

I keep importing data to my git annex, which gets bigger.

Today while importing an old archive (with lots of files), git import failed with this unhelpful message:

    $ git annex import /Users/public/Documents
    import Documents/.DS_Store
      not importing Documents/.DS_Store which is .gitignored (use --force to override)
    failed
    ...
    import Documents/Recettes/recettes nicoises/20130511_201509.jpg ok
    (recording state in git...)
    git-annex: import: 10 failed
    CallStack (from HasCallStack):
      error, called at ./CmdLine/Action.hs:41:28 in main:CmdLine.Action

It seems no data was lost: I could finish the import with "git commit" (and diff -R with the backup shows no difference). But I would like to know what did happen.
And also what does the "10" mean in this context and how to get more information?

Note that I might have a real problem on this system

* many filenames have extend chars
* I'm not sure the mac OS locale setup is OK
* I'm quite low on disk space and inodes:

      $ df
      Filesystem    512-blocks       Used Available Capacity   iused   ifree %iused  Mounted on

The version is
