I don't know of any freebsd build of git-annex that would use its
self-upgrade facility. I don't provide one, and I don't see why the
freebsd porters would enable that feature.

I wonder if you're somehow using the linux standalone build on freebsd via
some linux syscall compatability layer. Which is interesting if it works,
but not suprising if it fails.. 

In particular, it seems likely that the
linux version of lsof wouldn't be very happy when run in a freebsd
system, and perhaps that's why it's running out of memory.
