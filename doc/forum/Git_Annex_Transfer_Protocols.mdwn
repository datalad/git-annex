Hi,

May I know, which processes git-annex is using to move/copy/get file content between repositories?
Is it using same processes which git uses, Like send-pack, receive-pack.
I want to use Aspera to move file contents between repositories.
Is it enough if I customize send-pack, receive-pack of git code to do Aspera file transfer or git-annex uses any other transfer mechanism.

Many Thanks,
Royal Pinto
