If the file was modified, git-annex should notice and add the new version. So the mere act of modifying the file does not explain how you ended up with a symlink to the old version of the file. Although it does explain why git-annex log would show that the old version of the file had been deleted.

What does `git log` say when run on the workspace.xml file?
