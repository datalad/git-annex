What is the correct way to add/modify files such that the changes are synchronized?

Suppose I have a server "server" and a windows client "client" (more after some time); everything direct mode.

I created the repos on the server:

     cd bin
     git init
     git annex init server
     git annex direct
     git annex add .
     git annex sync

On the (Windows) client using cygwin:

     git annex clone ssh://me@server:/srv/bin
     cd bin
     git annex init client

Then I want to add files on the client:

     git annex add tools
     git annex sync

At this point I wonder that the data is not copied to the server but only metadata!
I then used

     git annex sync --content

but then everything from the server is leeched as well (as if I could have called "git annex get .")

What is the intented workflow such that added/modified files on the client always go to the server, modified/new files from the server are always pulled but ONLY if I previously got the file/directory via "get annex get"?
