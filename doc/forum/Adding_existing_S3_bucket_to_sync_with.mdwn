Hello,

I am just starting to learn git-annex so forgive me if this is a naive question.

I have the following repositories:

1. Home (laptop)
2. Work (mac mini)
3. S3 bucket
4. USB drive, full backup, attached to Home laptop.

I want to sync files between Home and Work via the S3 bucket.  It is not clear to me how to accomplish this through the git-annex assistant.  Is this possible? Are there instructions online?

Thanks in advance!

Scott
