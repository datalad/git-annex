I have a big git-annex repository. If I add a few files on my laptop I want to sync it with my server which consists of one bare git-annex repository (server_bare) and one regular git-annex repository (server).

I run

git annex sync
git annex copy * --to server

The second command is really slow since it runs git annex copy on every single file that I have locally (it sometimes takes an hour to complete). If I would instead run

git annex sync
git annex get .

This is usually quite fast, but it is not so easy to do since I don't keep an SSH port open on my laptop.

My question: Is there any command that I can run on my laptop which basically runs "git annex get ." from the server?
