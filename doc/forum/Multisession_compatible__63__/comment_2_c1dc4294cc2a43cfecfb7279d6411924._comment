Well obviously if you have the git-annex branch checked out, any operation
involving the work tree is not going to operate on the usual work tree.
So obviously `git add` and `git annex add` are not going to do what you
want them to do (unless you want them to add files to the checked-out
git-annex branch). I'm not sure what other problems you might run into
doing that.

git-annex uses the .git/annex/index file to stage commits to the git-annex
branch. Using that index file might help with rebasing or other operations
on the branch. 

It's certianly
theoretically possible to rebase without touching the work tree and only
using such an index file, but I don't know if git's rebase works that way.
I also don't see any particular benefit to rebasing the git-annex branch.
