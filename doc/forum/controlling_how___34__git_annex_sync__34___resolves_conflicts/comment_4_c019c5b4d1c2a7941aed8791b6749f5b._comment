Well, a git `update` hook is the only way to utterly prevent non-ff's being
pushed.

Since you're checking out the repository fresh each time, your scripts
could use `git annex sync --no-pull`. That would fail if someone else
pushed work to the repo in the meantime, and you could then use whatever
git commands make sense for you to fetch and rebase on top of the new changes.
