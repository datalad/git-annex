I'm running [git-annex](http://ix.io/gJJ) from <https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/git-annex-bin> btw on Archlinux.

I fetched a copy of my [git-annex wedding test repo](https://github.com/kaihendry/krwedding) to a machine on ssh called 'bible'.

Now I'm trying to fetch via ssh from my local machine "X1C3".

I can't work out how to fetch from it from b1b15a9b-1aa1-4f94-8b9a-2186d71c0d1a .... what am I missing?

Why doesn't the UUID work? :/

I even [tried renaming the remote to the UUID... didn't work](http://ix.io/gJI)

**Solution**: Neither UUID or the description is used by get. I also should not have resorted to [[special_remotes]] setup for setting up a git remote.

# Issue 1

Keep getting `git-annex-shell: user error (git ["config","--null","--list"] exited 126)` even though when I run `git config` my return error is 0: <http://ix.io/gJG>

**Solution**: This was because my ssh git URL was incorrect. A better error message has been implemented: <http://source.git-annex.branchable.com/?p=source.git;a=commitdiff;h=3439ea4>


# Issue 2

I can't work out the [git-annex remote type for ssh, in order to rename the remote](http://ix.io/gJH). I think the issue here is that my ssh remote name "Jamie's bible" doesn't match with the `git remote` name bible.

**Solution**: A _rw_ git URL configured with `git remote` are not [[special_remotes]]. I confused the two. If you need to define public git URL ([[time capsule use case|future_proofing]]), it is possible with an undocumented `git annex initremote foo type=git location=url`. So to summarise, just manually setup the git remote `git remote add ssh://someplace/path/to/repo` (don't worry about the name) and git-annex will find it!
