One more thing: integration in TortoiseGit would be sooooooooo great! You would then even be able to let novice computer users use git-annex.

I added a feature request long time ago but it's on hold: http://code.google.com/p/tortoisegit/issues/detail?id=2166

I do hope that git-annex becomes more popular to increase the chance that it will be built into that...
