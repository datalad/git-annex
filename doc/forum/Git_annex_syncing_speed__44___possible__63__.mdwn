Hello

I'm trying Git annex latest builds available in Linux & Android
Here is the scenario :-

Syncing 2 peer devices running Linux & Android
Devices can access each other directly over Cisco VPN encrypted link

Currently, syncing files via rsync over webdav (over Cisco VPN)
Everything is working, manual file tracking is an issue.

Here's where Git annex steps in,
I've configures external jabber account so they can talk to each other.

But the transfers are super-slow over internet,
I'm guessing Cisco VPN adding 15-20% overhead + SSH adding another 20-30% overhead.

Since the network link is trusted, is there any way to speed things up assuming Cisco solution
remains in place?

looking to solve this issue
