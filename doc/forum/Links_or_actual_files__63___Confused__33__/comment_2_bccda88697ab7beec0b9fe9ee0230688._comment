well, i did it using the webapp both times; i've barely scratched at the git-annex commandline so far.

However... I then tried to repeat it on another linux box (running ubuntu saucy and the version of git-annex in that repo) and it worked as expected: Real files in the annex directory, ie: as I understand it, direct mode.

So, went back to the first linux box (running ubuntu raring), and cleared everything off, quit and started again, doing the same thing again, and *it* did the direct mode thing itself this time.

Which I think leaves me with it the way I want it. :-)

My only guess is, maybe it got set up in non-direct mode when I first started using the older git-annex in the raring repos, before failing with the bad comment in ssh public key bug, at which point I switched to the downloaded-today tarball and just tried to resume. Starting from scratch with the newer version worked.

I'm sure more questions to come later; am a Dropbox fugitive by way of ownCloud (won't-fix bug on version upgrades) basically trying to replicate that kind of convenience. But those are for other postings.
