I want to go back to a specific commit in git annex as I lost most recent copies of a file and want to revert back to a previous revision, few months old. All remotes are dead but after reading few article, there might be a way to get the file back from the objects directory:

git annex whereis image 
whereis image (0 copies) failed
git-annex: whereis: 1 failed

Thanks,
