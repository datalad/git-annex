Issue with getting files from a Linux ssh/rsync repo.

I have a centralized repo on a small linux VM that I synchronize my workstations with, most are linux machines but one is a windows one.  I installed msysgit and git-annex for windows, and then run the following:

```
git clone ssh://user@IP.ADDRESS/home/user/annex annex  

cd annex  

git annex init 'windows'  

git annex copy --from origin  
```

So basically I am just trying to get a copy of the central repo onto this windows machine for starters and get:

```
rsync: connection unexpectedly closed (0 bytes received so far) [sender]
 
rsync error: error in rsync protocol data stream (code 12) at io.c(226) [sender=3.1.1] 
 
rsync: connection unexpectedly closed (0 bytes received so far) [Receiver]  

rsync error: error in rsync proto  

co  rsync failed -- run git annex again to resume file transfer  

l dafailed

ta stream (code 12) atcopy  
```

And I get this message for every file.


I do have cygwin with rsync and ssh installed on this machine previously so I tried on a separate machine thinking there may be compatibility issues with no avail either.  I am not sure if this is an existing issue/work in progress with Windows/git-annex or if it is something I am just experiencing.
