This error message is a `git push` error message.
I've never seen this error before.. 

<http://www.markhneedham.com/blog/2013/06/13/git-having-a-branchtag-with-the-same-name-error-dst-refspec-matches-more-than-one/>
Shows one way to get into this situation, where a repository somehow has
a tag with the same name as the branch that is being pushed.

<https://lostechies.com/jasonmeridth/2010/02/27/refspec-matches-more-than-one/>>
Similarly shows it being a conflict between a tag and a branch;
this time the tag exists in the local repository.

I guess you've run into some problem like this. If there's an easy way to
reproduce the problem using just git-annex commands, and not manaul tag
creation etc, please file a bug report with details.
