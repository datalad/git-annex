Hi,

It is possible to keep devices sync only using a box.com account as a transfer remote, without Jabber? I can't use Jabber because of firewall restrictions.

It would be nice to be able to use the transfer remote, in my case box.net, as the sync "provider", for example by polling a file with the needed changes in a pre-defined interval.

Regards,

Stone
