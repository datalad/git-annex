wow, are you git annexing your whole home directory?  that sounds extreme and problematic, since everything in git annex becomes read-only!!

This how to make git annex ignore something though: make git ignore it in the first place.

Stop the git assistant if it's running.

create a file called \".gitignore\" in the root of your annex directory; add a line to that file for everything you want git (and therefore git annex) to ignore, e.g. \".thunderbird\"


e.g.:

    echo '.thunderbird' > '.gitignore'

check that file into git:


    git add .gitignore
    git commit -m 'check in .gitignore'

Now you should be able to start up git-annex again and have it ignore .thunderbird, or any other path you put in .gitignore
