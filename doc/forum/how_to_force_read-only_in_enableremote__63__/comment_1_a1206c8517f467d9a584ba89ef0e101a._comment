git-annex auto-init the local repository whenever it sees it's not
enabled and there is a git-annex branch (or origin/git-annex etc).
This is what adds the uuid of the local repository to remote.log.
So, it's not specific to `enableremote`; many git-annex commands
will do the same thing. And git-annex needs to allocate a uuid for the
local repo in order to work.

One way to deal with it is to use `git annex reinit` so it uses
some already existing uuid. Although then getting files etc will
update the records using that uuid. Might be ok if you have one
uuid, perhaps one you've marked dead, that you use for this purpose
and don't care what's recorded for that uuid.

Or, it might be better to let git-annex auto-init a new uuid, 
and just configure this test repo to not push changes out to
elsewhere. For example, `git config remote.origin.annex-readonly true`
will make `git annex sync` avoid pushing back to the origin remote.
