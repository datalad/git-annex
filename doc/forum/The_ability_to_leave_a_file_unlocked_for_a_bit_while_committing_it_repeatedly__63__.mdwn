Sometimes I'm doing something crazy like working in a large GIMP file, and I just want to be able to keep "committing" the changes to the annex but I hate running into the problem of having to keep unlocking the file over and over again while saving.  I guess one solution to this might be to use git-annex assistant?  But I'm not sure I really want a daemon running, and I don't want this auto-added... I just want to be able to leave the file unlocked while I'm actively working on it, then eventually say "I'm done with this!" and set it back to a state where it's locked.

Basically, I hate running into "permission denied" errors all the time when I'm saving!  I guess I could do some sort of command where I commit to the annex and then immediately unlock again... is there a better way?
