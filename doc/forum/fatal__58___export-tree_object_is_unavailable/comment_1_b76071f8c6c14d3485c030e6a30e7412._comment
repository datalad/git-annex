I just tried using `git write-tree` to write a random tree, then renamed it to match the missing objects name... and my annex is now syncing. I thought git would complain about having a file with the sha1 not matching the contents, but so far so good. I'm pretty sure `git fsck` is not going to likei it. Hopefully I've not broken anything.
