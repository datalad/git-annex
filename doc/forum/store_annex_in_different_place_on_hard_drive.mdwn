I have the following setup on my work computer. The /home folder has limited space, but excellent backups, so I would like to keep my main repository there.
The /scratch/ folder has no backup, but has faster read/write speed, and more storage space. Is there a way to keep the main repo in /home, but somehow store the large annexed files on /scratch. I am open to making a remote repository, but the standard "git annex get" workflow will simply copy large files into the /home directory, which is what i want to avoid altogther. Can I just make a symlink from "/home/<username>/repo/.git/annex" to "/scratch/repodata" somehow? Thanks!
