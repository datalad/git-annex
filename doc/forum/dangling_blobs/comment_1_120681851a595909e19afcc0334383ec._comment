This message from git fsck does not indicate any kind of serious problem
with the repository.

A dangling blob can be added to a git repository when something gets
staged but is then never included in a commit. For example, with the
assistant, if a file is created, and then modified soon after, the
original version would get staged, but before it was committed, the
new version staged and included in the commit. 

There are several other scenarios, involving the assistant and not, where
that could happen.

So, git is telling you that the git repository contains
information that's not being used. Unless you are low on disk
space this probably doesn't matter, and git will automatically
clean up dangling blobs after a while (or see `git gc`).
