I need to implement some functionality that should work in similar ways when faced with a plain Git vs a git-annex repo. In this context I am looking for the cheapest of the appropriate tests for an initialized annex?

I have looked at

- `git config annex.uuid` (~3ms)
- `git rev-parse git-annex` (~3ms)
- `git annex info --fast -q` (~50ms)

Are  the fast ones sufficient to guarantee that no subsequent call to a git-annex command would yield `git-annex: First run: git-annex init`?

Thanks!
