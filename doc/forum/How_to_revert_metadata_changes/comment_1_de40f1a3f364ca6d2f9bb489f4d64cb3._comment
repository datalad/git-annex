`git-annex metadata` used to affect all files under the current directory
if you left off the files to update. That changed a while ago to prevent
that fairly common mistake, pity your git-annex is too old to have that
fixed.

You're on sort of the right track with the git-annex branch, but there are some
complications:

1. .git/annex/index is the index file for the git-annex branch. When you
   change the git-annex branch manually, you also need to delete that
   file. This will cause git-annex to re-generate its index from the new
   contents of the branch.
2. Resetting the git-annex branch to a previous rev won't "stick"
   if the problimatic rev has already been pushed to other repositories.
   git-annex will automatically re-merge the git-annex branches from other
   repos at some point and get the problem rev back. Instead you'll need to
   make a commit to the git-annex branch that undoes the changes made by the
   problem rev. (eg `git revert`)
3. The contents of the git-annex branch are merged by essentially
   taking the union of the local and remote contents.
   So if some other clone of the repository still has the
   problimatic data in its git-annex branch, when git-annex union
   merges that in, the problem data will come back again, even if you've
   made a local commit that reverts its addition.

So, you can easily deal with #1; it wouldn't be hard to do #2, but #3
will be a real sticking point, if the bad data has been pushed out to any
other repos.

In that case, the only thing to do is to record new information on the
git-annex branch, so git-annex knows that even if this metadata was set
before, it's not set any longer. The way to do that is just use
`git annex metadata --set name-=bla`
