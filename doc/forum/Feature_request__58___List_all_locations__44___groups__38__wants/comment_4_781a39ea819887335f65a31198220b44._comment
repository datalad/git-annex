Opened todo for my idea, [[git-annex_list_with_want_get_and_drop]].

Back to what you were wanting.. I think there is a lot of room for
improvements on querying in this area.

`git-annex info repo` could display the groups the repo is in, as well as
its preferred content expression, as well as any groupwanted expression,
and the standard preferred content expression.

There could be a command that just outputs a list of groups, one per line.
Maybe `git-annex group --list`

Then you could get your dump of the groupwanted configurations for each
group:

	for g in $(git-annex group --list); do git-annex groupwanted $g; done

There could also be a command that lists the repositories that are in a
group. Maybe `git-annex group --members-of=group`
