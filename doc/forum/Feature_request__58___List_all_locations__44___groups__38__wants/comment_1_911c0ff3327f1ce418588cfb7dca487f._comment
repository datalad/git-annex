This doesn't exist and you need to script it yourself, e.g. with `git annex info --fast --json` and then subsequent calls to `git annex group ...` etc. I want to include this in [`git annex control-center`](https://gitlab.com/nobodyinperson/git-annex-control-center) eventually, but didn't have the time yet.
