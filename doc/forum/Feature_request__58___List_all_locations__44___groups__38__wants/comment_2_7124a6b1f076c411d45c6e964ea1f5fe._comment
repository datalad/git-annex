Are you talking about listing information about the configuration of
repositories, or listing information about which repos want a file?

I can imagine extending `git-annex list` to display eg, a "-" if the 
repository currently has, but does not want a file, and a "+" 
if the repository wants, but does not currently have a file.
Or something like that.

If the goal is an overview of configuration from the git-annex branch, I
agree `git-annex vicfg` is not perfect, and it would be nice to have
something that dumped out all the configuration.
