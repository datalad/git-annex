Well, that is an awesome idea with the more detailed info about each file. I did not thought about this yet.

But what I was talking about is dumping - in a more asthetic way - the remote configuration with its groups and wanteds (for example \"standard\" or \"groupwanted\" or some custom ones).

Furthermore it would be great to even dump the groupwanted configuration for each group and for reference all the standard definitions.

git annex vicfg is more for editing the configuration, but it is visually less appealing for just dumping and reading the information.
