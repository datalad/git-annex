Joey, your comment is really disappointing. I also use Dropbox as a central git repo and it works great for me. Maybe you find this stupid, but there is a lot of people with good reasons to do so. I agree that this is your software project, thus you have the right not to support this use case, but you don't have the right to treat the users that want this feature as you did in your comment. Next time you do a new crowdfunding campaign, I not sure I'll be between the donors again.
