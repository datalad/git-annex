Why not just use git the way it's designed: Make a git repository on one computer. Clone to another computer. Commit changes on either whenever you like, and pull/push whenever you like. No need for any dropbox to help git sync, it can do so perfectly well on its own.

If you have a lot of repositories, see <http://myrepos.branchable.com/>

I continue to be unimpressed and unmotived by this use case. Posting more forum threads with the same lame reasons won't help. But at least you did say:

> For some time I used Bazaar repos inside Dropbox.  A couple of times I accidentally modified files on one computer before another finished syncing
, and the repo became mildly corrupted, but I recovered it okay.

> Recently I switched to git, and so far, so good.  I'm careful not to make any changes to my files before Dropbox is finished syncing, so everythin
g works fine.

So, you used dropbox, and corrupted data.  But that was ok. And now you're very careful to avoid doing things that will corrupt data. But that's ok. Yeah, that seems like a really good decision, given all the excellent possibilities out there.`</snark>`
