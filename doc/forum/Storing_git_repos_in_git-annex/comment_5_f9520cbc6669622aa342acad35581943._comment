My, 2 cents. I used to do the same keep my git repos in Dropbox. I do not push/pull to dropbox I just keep them in there so they sync between my machines. My use case is that I am in the middle of a change and I need to switch computers (home/office) I can continue where I left of on another machine otherwise you have to make wierd commits with broken code. So IMHO it is perfectly reasonable for a single person to keep his git repo in git-annex assuming I don't use it as a central repo where other people pull push.

Plus one giant problem with git annex is that there is no way to revert a file in direct repo. It only sync and reverting to old files take a lot of effort (convert to indirect checkout commit save file to a temp location convert back to direct mode place the file back its place.) with a git repo in annex I can just use git to revert files.

On the other hand, git likes to create a lot of small files and sync them can take a lot of time. annex copies on file at a time.

That said, at one point I did experiment putting a git repo in annex for testing (using --git-dir option) it did work so it should not be that big of a deal to add the support.
