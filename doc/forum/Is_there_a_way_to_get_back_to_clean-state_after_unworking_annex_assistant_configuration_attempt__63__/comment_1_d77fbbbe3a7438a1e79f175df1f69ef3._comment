I think I found reliable although a bit excessive way to get back to clean state:

1. stop all the running daemons
2. on android, remove folder git-annex.home
3. on linux, remove ~/.config/git-annex and ~/.ssh/git-annex
4. on both attempted repositories I removed .git folder  
5. I removed everything I have stored on rsync.net

Then I re-did the steps on good wifi network an plugged in to power source on both devices :-)
It seems that important step is to wait for the annex to share the remote repo with the other device (took ~5 minutes)
