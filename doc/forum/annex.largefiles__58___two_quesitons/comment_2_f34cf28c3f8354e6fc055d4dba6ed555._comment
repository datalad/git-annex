Just to prevent a potential misunderstanding: There are two ways to configure annex.largefiles.

1. in `.git/config`, e.g., via `git config annex.largefiles=...`
2. in `.gitattributes`

The first configuration is specific to your local copy of the repository and does not travel with the content,
whereas the second one does carry the configuration over to the other repos.
