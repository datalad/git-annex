Hello,

I am on OS X, using version 5.20140613.  I installed using brew.

I have a really simple example where I'm trying to use local rsync to test transfer between two repos.  It keeps asking me for a password over and over.  I do not know what password it is.

I'm literally doing just this:

    $ cd annex-tests
    $ mkdir target
    $ mkdir source
    $ cat > source/text
    hi this is a test
    $ cd source
    $ git init
    Initialized empty Git repository in /Users/me/Documents/annex-tests/source/.git/
    $ git annex init
    init  ok
    (Recording state in git...)
    $ git annex initremote rsync-login type=rsync rsyncurl=me@localhost:/Users/me/Documents/annex-tests/target encryption=none
    initremote rsync-login ok
    (Recording state in git...)
    $ git annex describe rsync-login "test rsync url with a login"
    describe rsync-login ok
    (Recording state in git...)
    $ git annex add text 
    add text ok
    (Recording state in git...)
    $ git annex sync rsync-login --content
    commit  ok
    copy text copy text (checking rsync-login...) Password:
    Password:
    Password:
    Password:
    Password:

I try a blank password, I try my login password, I tried 'none' (the encryption type), I try everything..  no dice

So right off the bat let me explain a few things.

1 -  Why not use rsa keys?  Because I was having the exact same problem and I wanted to make it even easier and use login/password

2 -  Why not use the webapp since a few forum posts say you can set passwords in there?  because my annex doesn't seem to recognize the command.

    $ git annex webapp
    git-annex: unknown command webapp

3 -  I verified my rsync command/url appears ok by doing the following.  The password for that command is as expected, it is my username password:

    $ cat > test2
    hi test
    $ rsync test2 me@localhost:/Users/me/Documents/annex-tests/target
    Password:
    $ cat /Users/me/Documents/annex-tests/target/test2
    hi test


Any help will be appreciated!
