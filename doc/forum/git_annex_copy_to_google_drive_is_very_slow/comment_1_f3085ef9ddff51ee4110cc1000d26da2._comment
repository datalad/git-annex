How large are the individual files?

With small enough files, non-bandwidth related overhead and/or TCL slow
start can take more time than copying the file does, preventing saturating
a connection.

It sometimes helps to use -J10 or so.

The --fast option can also speed up `git-annex copy`,
see the [[git-annex-copy]] man page for details about it.
