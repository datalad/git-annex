Thank you for the heads up! 

I've actually looked in to DataLad, and have been using git annex with submodules.

Problem I found with submodules is that they required a lot of additional steps as far as adding/moving/deleting/syncing them. A very manual process, with a lot of complexity and some rough edge cases. They also interfere with some of Git-Annex functionality like metadata driven views I believe. So I'm using submodules very sparingly, only when I really need them.

As far as DataLad - it looks like a mature and well supported project, would love to see more feedback/reviews on it.
