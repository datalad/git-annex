Sorry for the delay getting to this post.

The lack of jabber support on Windows makes this a bit hard to set up. You instead need to make a git repository some place that both the Windows and Linux machines can both connect to. Once git-annex on both systems is syncing with that common git repository, the Windows system will learn about the encrypted remotes you have set up, and then `git annex enableremote` will be able to use them with no problem.

Of course, if you don't trust your ssh server where you already made an encrypted remote, you may not want to store a un-encrypted git repository on it, and since Windows also doesn't support encrypted git repositories yet, you'd be sort of out of luck. (For now; Windows support is being improved.) 

OTOH, if you just set up that encrypted rsync remote on the ssh server because the ssh server didn't have git-annex installed on it, you can easily also put a git repository on the ssh server, and the combination will be enough to let you sync between the 2 machines.
