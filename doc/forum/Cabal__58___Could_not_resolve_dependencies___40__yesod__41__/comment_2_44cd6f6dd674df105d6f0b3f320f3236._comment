thanks, that resolved the dependency trouble.
But now:

    Building git-annex-3.20120826...
    Preprocessing executable 'git-annex' for git-annex-3.20120826...

    Utility/Yesod.hs:15:8:
        Could not find module `Data.Default'
        It is a member of the hidden package `data-default-0.5.0'.
        Perhaps you need to add `data-default' to the build-depends in your .cabal file.
        Use -v to see a list of the files searched for.
