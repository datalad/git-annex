Make a non-bare git repository on your server. Run `git annex init` in it. Run `git annex assistant` in it.

Now on your notebook, you can tell the assistant to use a remote ssh server, and point it at that directory. It will see the repository already exists, and use it, rather than making a new bare repository. The assistant daemon you've run on the server will notice when changes are pushed to the directory, and update it. 

You can further set up XMPP, so that the server can tell the notebook if you make any modifications to the server. You can do this by running `git annex webapp --listen=IPADDRESS` on the server, and opening the url it prints out. But this is optional, only needed if you're going to be editing files on the server.
