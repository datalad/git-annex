I setup a non-bare repo on a server by following the above steps (git init, git annex init, then add it as a Remote Server from elsewhere and combine repos). It worked, but I hit a snag and needed to add another step.

After git init, you're not sitting on any branch yet, and that seems to have prevented the assistant from doing anything to synchronize the working tree on the server. After I did \"git checkout synced/master\", it started working.
