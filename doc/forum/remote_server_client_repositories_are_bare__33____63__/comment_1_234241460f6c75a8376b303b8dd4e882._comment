I found a partial answer on http://git-annex.branchable.com/forum/Add_a___34__local__34___remote :
\"The webapp does not set up remote non-bare repositories because unless the user is comfortable with the cli, nothing is going to keep them up-to-date.\"

So, clearly \"Remote server\" isn't what I want, but my \"desktop\" is headless and using jabber seems a silly complication when I have a perfectly fine ssh connection.  This isn't as trivial as I had expected.
