There's at least one caveat with the 'git checkout synced/master' workaround. When the local assistant next tries to sync with the remote, it will try to push, and the remote will refuse the push into the currently checked out branch:

[2014-12-26 02:40:10 EST] main: Syncing with nyc.nanobit.org_annex 
remote: error: refusing to update checked out branch: refs/heads/synced/master        
remote: error: By default, updating the current branch in a non-bare repository
