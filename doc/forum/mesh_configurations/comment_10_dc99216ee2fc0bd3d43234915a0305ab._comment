I'm not comfortable making core.sharedrepository settings affect creds
files. You don't normally want to give out S3 creds to other users in a
unix group. And in the "everybody" case, it certianly seems entirely wrong
to make the creds files world-readable. Willing to live with a little
inconsistency here in order to not blow user's bank accounts off. It would
be good to document it somewhere.

Your paste seems to show A as being in the "sourcethis" group, not the
"source" group. I don't know what that means.

The assistant should notice config changes to the git-annex branch within
60 seconds of them being received. Syncs happen when changes are detected,
or every 30 minutes.
