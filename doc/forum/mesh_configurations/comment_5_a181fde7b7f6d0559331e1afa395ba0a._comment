You have B configured as a regular transfer repo, so it only wants to drop
files once they have reached some client repos. Settings its preferred
content to "not inallgroup=backup" should fix that.

Also, the assistant can notice some configuration changes that are made
while it's running, but maybe not all of them, and maybe it won't rescan
files to transfer right away after such a change is made. I'd use `git
annex sync --content` to test such changes, and save the assistant for once
I have a working setup.
