It's easy to see why a file is not copied from source repo A to source repo
B: The preferred content expression for a source repo is "not (copies=1)",
so a source repo will not want to get any files from any other repo.

You probably want to make the central repo use transfer; that's basically
what it's for. Note that a transfer repo hangs onto file content until it
reaches all client repos. So you might want to change the preferred content
expression to refer to backup repos. Something as simple as this might
work:

	not inallgroup=backup

I don't see any reason why a file wouldn't move from B to backup repo C,
but I don't see anything in your transcript that shows that not happening
either. Your transcript doesn't actually show running any git-annex commands
that move file contents at all; no git annex copy/move, and the sync is not
run with --content...
