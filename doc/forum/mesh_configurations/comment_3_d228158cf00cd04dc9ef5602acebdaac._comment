Your transcript doesn't show the assistant running. It's not clear that, in
your live deployment, any files ever got to repo B for the assistant there
to deal with.

Repos such as B need a preferred content expression like the one I gave. It
doesn't matter a whole lot what group is used for them; overriding the
groupwanted for the transfer group to use that expression would be one way
to do it.
