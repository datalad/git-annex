It would help if you described what command you ran, or buttons you clicked
on to get this to happen. Otherwise, I'm left making a lot of guesses..

It looks like you might be running `git-annex enableremote` of a gcrypt
special remote that you set up earlier. 

It appears that the gcrypt remote has a gcrypt-id which is not the same as
the one that was used when that special remote was originally initialized.

I don't know why this would happen, and without details about what you did,
I can barely venture a guess. All I can say is that, gcrypt is supposed to
pick a gcrypt-id the first time a gcrypt remote is used, and not change it
afterwards.

... It might be that you did something that caused gcrypt to pick a new
gcrypt-id.

... It might be that the special remote has been pointed at a different
gcrypt repository than the one that it was initially set up to use.

It might help to look at both the local repository's `.git/config`, and the
gcrypt git repositories git config, and see which of
them have the wrong gcrypt-id value of ":id:SCPxErEQVlqp+Hl6Su0f".
If only the local .git/config has that value and the gcrypt git repository
has some other gcrypt-id, then the other one is probably the right one, and
it might work to replace the wrong one with the right one.
