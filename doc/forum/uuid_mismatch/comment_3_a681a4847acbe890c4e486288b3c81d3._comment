Hi joey,

After modifying the gcrypt-id as you proposed, I have finally managed to clone the repo with  

`git clone gcrypt::ssh://my.domain/home/admin/`

But now I get only unresolved symbolic links for each files, that is .git/annex/objects directory only contains .map files.

Would you have an idea about the reason/source of this behavior?

Thank you so much,
Guillaume
