I thought I'd followed the walk through when initially setting up my repos.

However I find that I have to do the following to sync my annex's.

    git pull remote master
    git checkout git-annex
    git pull remote git-annex
    git checkout master
    git annex get .

Has something gone wrong? I see no mention of syncing git-annex repos in the walk-through...
