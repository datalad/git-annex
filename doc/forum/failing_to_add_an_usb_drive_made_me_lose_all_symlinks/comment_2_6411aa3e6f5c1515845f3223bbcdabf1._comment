I'm not new to git, and I perfectly know how to revert commits, however, I was confused about how git annex and git play together. In particular I tried to use it as a black box with the assistant and that was a bad idea.
After adding the usb drive as remote with the assitant, all symlinks got deleted. However, doing a checkout to the commit that messed up everything I got thing back to normal.
Sadly, your message arrived a couple of hours late, I could have saved me a lot of time.
Thanks for taking the time to answer.
Sorry for the previous rant.
Best regards,
                      Juan
