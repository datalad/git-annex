Well, git-annex just uses a regular git repo. It should not be possible to
fully lose data. I suggest you run `git log
--stat` and see if a commit deleted all your files. If so, you can revert
that commit.

If the git log really is only 4 commits deep, perhaps you got some other
branch checked out somehow. Run `git reflog` to see the history of what
branches have been checked out before, and you can use `git checkout` to go
back to one of those past checkouts.

Or, failing all that, you showed a commit
a6362df13d728037875320a457182acb073d08ea which had one of your files,
so `git checkout a6362df13d728037875320a457182acb073d08ea` will check out
the tree as it appeared at the time of that commit.

This is all git 101. AFAICS, you have not lost any data, and need to become
more familiar with the basics of git.
