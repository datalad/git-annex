It's failing to pull the git repository from the remote because that
git repository is apparently larger than 487 mb. That is not usual 
when using git-annex, or even when using git unless you have millions
of files in the git repository.

Since you only have a few thousand files in the git repository,
my guess is you have committed some large files directly to git,
instead of using git-annex. So, you're seeing why git-annex exists...

You should find the files in your git repository that are not git-annex
symlinks, and are large files. You may need to use `git filter-branch`
to remove the from your repository's history.
