Specifying the UUID was supposed to work, I think I broke it a while ago. Fixed now in git.

I'm not sure why you need to look up the UUID of the current repository. You can always refer to the current repository as \".\". Anyway, the UUID of the current repository is in `.git/config`, or use `git config annex.uuid`.
