With the separate autoenabled remote for PRs, the UX could look like this:

	> git-annex add myfile
	add myfile ok
	> git commit -m foo
	> git push origin HEAD:refs/for/main -o topic="add myfile"
	> git-annex push origin-PRs
	copy myfile (to origin-PRs) ... ok

Or with a small git-annex improvement, even:

	> git-annex assist -o topic="add myfile"
	add myfile ok
	copy myfile (to origin-PRs) ... ok

For this, origin-PRs would want all files not in origin,
and origin would want all files not in origin-PRs. And origin-PRs would
need to have a lower cost than origin so that it doesn't first try, and
fail, to copy the file to origin.
