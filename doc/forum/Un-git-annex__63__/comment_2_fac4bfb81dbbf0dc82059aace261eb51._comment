I had uninit'd my annex several time for testing git-annex. What I discovered was that is worked reliably but for all files that are duplicates. For duplicates only 1 of the files got restored properly.  All that was 1 year ago - so your results my differ. I had found a piece of script in the forum / tips sections that will show all duplicates.

Hope this helps...
