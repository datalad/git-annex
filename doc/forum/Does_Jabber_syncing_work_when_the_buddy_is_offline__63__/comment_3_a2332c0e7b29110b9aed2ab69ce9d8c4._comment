That's done by the \"Remote server\" option on the Repositories page.

You need to have git-annex (any old version will do) installed on the server for this to work.

Of course, a regular git remote will do as well, although the assistant does not set this up. You could even use github for that remote, or a similar service; any remote added with `git remote add` will be used by the assistant.
