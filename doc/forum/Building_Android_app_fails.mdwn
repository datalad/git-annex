When trying to build the Android app, I'm able to successfully set up the chroot, and enter it. Once I am inside, as the user "builder" I get a failure on the second step of the installation process "In the chroot, run standalone/android/install-haskell-packages".

When I run this command, I get the following error:

    cbits/cryptonite_rdrand.c: In function ‘cryptonite_get_rand_bytes’:

    cabal: Error: some packages failed to install:
    cryptonite-0.16 failed during the building phase. The exception was:
    ExitFailure 1

So, there is a problem with building the haskell package "cryptonite-0.16".

I also get this output a little further up:

    Failed to install cryptonite-0.16
    Build log ( /home/builder/.cabal/logs/cryptonite-0.16.log ):
    Warning: cryptonite.cabal: Unknown fields: extra-doc-files (line 37)
    Fields allowed in this section:
    name, version, cabal-version, build-type, license, license-file,
    copyright, maintainer, build-depends, stability, homepage,
    package-url, bug-reports, synopsis, description, category, author,
    tested-with, data-files, data-dir, extra-source-files,
    extra-tmp-files

So perhaps that is helpful as well.


If anyone has any guidance on how to move beyond this or what needs to be changed, I'd appreciate it!

Thanks!
