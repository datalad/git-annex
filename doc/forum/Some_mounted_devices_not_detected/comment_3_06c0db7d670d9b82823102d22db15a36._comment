Hmm, that looks fine.

Perhaps the user you're running git-annex as cannot write to `/media/SoderUSB` ? The webapp avoids listing places you can't write, since it would fail to make a repository there. (Also because this is an easy way for it to avoid listing `/`, `/usr`, or whatever other OS-level mounts a system might have..)
