I have not put it on the schedule (and don't think I'll get to it this month), but I have added it to the [[roadmap|design/assistant]].

The main use cases it adds are encrypting git remotes on ssh servers, and on USB drives. Both are useful for sure..

It also opens the possibility of using github for encrypted git remotes, but with xmpp git push that is not a pressing use case. With significantly more work, encrypted git remotes could be stored on S3 etc, but again xmpp git push covers the same use cases.
