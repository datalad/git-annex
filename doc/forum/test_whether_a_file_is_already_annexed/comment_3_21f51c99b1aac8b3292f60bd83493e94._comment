Hm.. having some kind of exposure of the key generation code on the command line would actually be pretty useful. So you can do something like:

    find -type f | xargs git annex genkey --format '${key} ${file}'

Probably worth a TODO, really.

Regarding your situation, one way of doing it would be to recursively copy the photo directory as hardlinks, `git annex import --clean-duplicates` the hardlinked copies, then diff the directories. This would give you a list of removals and those removals are already in the repo.

Or if you just want to remove them, just run '*git annex import --clean-duplicates*' on the original photos directory. **NOTE: There was recently an issue with git-annex deleting files that it didn't have any known copies of, so a recent version is highly recommended if using --clean-duplicates.**
