First of all thank you for the answer and the bug report. Unfortunately git-annex whereis seems not to be the answer to my problem, because it works only when queried on already annexed files, while I'd like to test the yet-not-annexed ones. Here's an example using whereis:

    git-annex whereis SAM_7198.m4v     # SAM_7198.m4v is an already annexed files in the current directory, so within the repository: whereis works well
    whereis SAM_7198.m4v (2 copies)
        5dd7f891-579a-45c6-a5bf-3ca42e3a5f9a -- laptop [here]
        ebf56bea-2970-42b1-bace-9d72ac9ed8d1 -- emanuele@desktop:/home/emanuele/annex [origin]
    ok
    
    cp -L SAM_7198.m4v zzz  # creating a copy of a that file
    git-annex whereis zzz  # output is empty, so the file was not found, despite having the same content of SAM_7198.m4v and being in the repo dir
    
    cp -L SAM_7198.m4v /tmp/  # copying the annexed file outside the repo
    git-annex whereis /tmp/SAM_7198.m4v 
    fatal: /tmp/SAM_7198.m4v: '/tmp/SAM_7198.m4v' is outside repository
