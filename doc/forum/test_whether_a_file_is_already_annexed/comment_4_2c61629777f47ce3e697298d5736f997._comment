You can use either `git-annex import --deduplicate` 
or `git annex import --skip-duplicates` to import files from a directory
except for ones already in the repository. The former deletes the duplicate
files, and the latter leaves them as-is.

I don't think there's currently a good stand-alone way to check if a file is a
duplicate of content already in the annex, before adding it.
Would need a new command to be added. 

Of course, if you simply `git annex add` everything, regular hash based
deduplication will point the duplicate file to the same object used by
the file when you added it earlier. So, you don't need to worry about
adding duplicates wasting much space. They may make your repo more
cluttered than you like, is all.
