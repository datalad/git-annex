I have a repository synchronized between two PCs and box.com . I chose encryption for box.com. Today on my work computer I changed files, on box.com I see that there are changed files today. When I got home, I still see files with yesterday's date.
One thing to mention is that currently the work PC is not accessible. 

1. How do I debug this problem? I have logging set to debug via web console, saved, restarted daemon, but after restart the debug checkbox is unchecked.
From logs it looks like that after failing to connect to work pc via ssh it gives up:

    [2013-05-09 21:42:52 CEST] main: Syncing with box.com
this is first and last line mentioning box today, I restarted the daemon several times around 22:14 :

    [2013-05-09 22:11:40 CEST] TransferScanner: Syncing with [work pc repo]
    Already up-to-date.
    
    (scanning...) [2013-05-09 22:11:40 CEST] Watcher: Performing startup scan
    Already up-to-date.
    
    (started...) ssh: connect to host [work pc] port 22: No route to host
    fatal: The remote end hung up unexpectedly


2. where is the configuration for box.com stored? How can I check gpg key ID mentioned at http://git-annex.branchable.com/tips/using_box.com_as_a_special_remote/
3. how do I manually trigger sync with box.com? git fetch box.com neither git annex sync box.com doesn't work.
