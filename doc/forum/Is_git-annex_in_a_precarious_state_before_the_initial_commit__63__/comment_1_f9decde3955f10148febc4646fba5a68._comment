Yes, any git repository where there has not been an initial commit made is in an unusal situation. I've often felt this is a design flaw of git; it could start off with an empty root 00000 commit and avoid this complexity.

There are probably all kinds of fancy git commands that can be used to get out of the situation you describe, but finessing a perfect exit from a situation that has happened in the first 5 minutes of using a new repository seems like overkill. Just run `git annex unannex` to move all your files out of git-annex; run `git rm -rf .` to delete the files from the git-annex branch; run `rm -rf .git`, and you're back where you started with some files and no git repository.

... And no, neither git nor git-annex make any promises about keeping your data secure until you have both committed it and sent it somewhere else.
