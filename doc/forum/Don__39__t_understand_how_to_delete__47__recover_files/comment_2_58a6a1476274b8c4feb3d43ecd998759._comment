git-annex version: 3.20120629

git annex unused did not show me anything... dont know why... I did only \"rm Directory\" not git rm... but \"git annex watch\" did check it in... I sadly have reverted and droped the file now... but if you want I can try to delete other files the same way to see if annex unused shows them... then I post the hole commands... k I try it now:

oh I see the directory I wanted to drop did not get dropped because I set numcopies to 2 ;) so I try it again with that file:

1. rm -r directory
2. ls it is gone (should be ;) )

user@host:~/annex/SOFTWARE$ git annex unused
unused . (checking for unused data...) (checking master...) (checking synced/master...) (checking usbdrive/master...) ok
user@host:~/annex/SOFTWARE$ 

Is that like it should be? If so, should unused only show stuff that I delete with git rm?


-----------------------------------

Ok I did read the unused doku you pointed me. So I thought I got it, but I did not:

If I

1. rm File
2. in the usb-repos, git pull
both repositories dont have a link to the file.
3. git unused shows nothing
4. it seemed that the link AND the File it links to got deleted:

-../.git/annex/objects/pM/vq/SHA256-s1066518528--00c5e1b1610c0c2dfab05c7a55aaad

but the file size is 1gb, both directories dont get smaller... also if I use git gc after that it does not get smaller too.

Is there a way to really delete files from both repositories.
