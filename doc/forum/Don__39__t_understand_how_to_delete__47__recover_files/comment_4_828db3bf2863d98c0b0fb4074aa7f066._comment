hmm Ok I tried now something that seems to did it...  after I did checkin and pull the deletion of the soft-link of the file... I addionaly used git annex sync, and then again pushed it from the usb drive... now the unused command finds stuff...

So am I right now to make that happen:

1. delete the file in the \"main\" repos
2. git pull from the other repository(s)
3. git annex sync

4. git annex unused (now it founds something to delete)

5. git annex dropunused 1-1000 (or some other range) do that in both repositories to delete in on both... and do that maybe as cronjob (from point 2 to 5) or do the last last step only if a drive is nearly full (automaticly or manually...)

ok so maybe I could use that.

the advantages over something like rsync are...

1. I have a history and can reverse some operations (till I do step 5 ^^)
2. I am more flexible in repo/remote types
3. checksums get saved
4. I can have repo with all links but 0 data on a 3rd pc and can \"get\" stuff dynamicly (what is the cheapest transfeir) ot them... aka partial checkouts

ok I think the 4. advantage buys me ;)

hope I got it now right with the 5 step instruction.

keep up your great work, would have tried kickstarter here maybe too for other stuff... but I am no american ;) and eu-guys are not allowed, and I also have no relative in usa ;) but that only as a site note ;)
