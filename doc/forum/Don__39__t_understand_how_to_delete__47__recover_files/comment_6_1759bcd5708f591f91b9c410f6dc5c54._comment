ok I now at least got it that it is nice to run watch on both repositories... 

but what I dont get is, is the git annex watch commando not a automatic way so that this deamon makes sync command whenever needed? so I have to use git annex sync first on the repos where I delete the file and then again on the repos I want to receive that change... that seemed to work, but why did watch not do that for me???
