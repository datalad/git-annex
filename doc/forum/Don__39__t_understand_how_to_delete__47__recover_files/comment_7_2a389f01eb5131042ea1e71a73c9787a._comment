ok suprisingly that did not only sync the files but also did remove the file, so you dont need a pull... dont know what I did wrong the other times I tried, does maybe the  copy command also \"copies\" the delete commit?

but annyway that works for me... (for now I do the dropunused command manuelly...)

that should work as cronjob...
