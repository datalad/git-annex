It's easy to recreate. As I understand it, the entire process went something like this:

git annex initremote annex type=S3 encryption=blahblah # possibly this was done in the webapp?

git remote rename annex s3 # also possibly done in the webapp

# clone to different computer, and on the new clone:

git annex initremote s3

git-annex: Specify the type of remote with type=

git annex initremote s3 type=S3 encryption=blahblah

The last line creates a *new* remote.

I'm inclined to think the main confusing thing here is that initremote is used to both create a new special remote, and to configure the repository to use an already existing special remote that was created elsewhere. If you had to use `enableremote` for the latter,
things could be less confusing:

# clone to different computer, and on the new clone:

git annex enableremote s3

git-annex: No existing special remote named s3. Choose from one of these existing special remotes: annex
