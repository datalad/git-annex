What you describe, `git annex get $file --from remote` silently not doing anything, is the expected behavior if the remote doesn't have the file. This allows you to eg, run `git annex get . --from remote` and get all files that the remote does have while skipping the rest.

Did you ever try looking at `git annex whereis $file` ?
