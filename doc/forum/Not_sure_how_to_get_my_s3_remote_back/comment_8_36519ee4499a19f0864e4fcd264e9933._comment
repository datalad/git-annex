Most of this is perfectly normal. The duplication of lines are normal; when two git-annex branches are union merged, it's as if it runs `cat branch1:file branch2:file | uniq > file`. When there are conflicting lines for the same uuid, the one with the newest timestamp is used.

The description of the remote in uuid.log is also not relevant to this bug.

This is the key part:

> The box remote was duplicated (with different davcreds and one having highRandomQuality=false)

As you note, 2013-04-24 15:15 was a merge. So there must have been two branches before, which had different box remotes with different davcreds. 

It would probably help if you can paste those lines as they looked after that merge (omitting most of the davcreds).

Also, I'd like to see the box line from the 11:05 commit.
