Oh.. I got confused by you talking about the box remote. Lines you pasted look ok anyway.

Ok, looking at the S3 remote then...

> I did notice that initially the s3 remote was named \"annex\". That was probably the web interface's doing, way back when I added it.

So, you can never change the names used to refer to remotes in remote.log. These names can be different from the names used to refer to the same remotes in .git/config. (Which can vary from repository to repository anyway..) So, if you originally added a s3 remote and called it \"annex\", you still need to use that name when running initremote elsewhere to add that remote to your repository.

The remote with name \"s3\" added in the 11:26 is a separate s3 remote, and I think one you don't want. (And have marked dead?)

I think all you need to do is \"git annex initremote annex\" to add the s3 remote you want to your new repository.
