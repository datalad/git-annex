I have an image 'logo.jpg' that is 100kb.  I am using indirect mode.
I add the logo to the annex; my understanding is that the file contents is stored in .git/annex/....

I do more work in Photoshop to improve logo.jpg.  Now, I have a new version of 'logo.jpg' that is 150kb.
I add this new version of logo.jpg to the annex.

Does the .git/annex area now contain two instances of the logo.jpg contents, one for the 100kb and one for the 150kb, with metadata pointing to each?
