To get to a specific version of a file, you need to have a tag or a branch that includes that version of the file. Check out the branch and `git annex get $file`. 

(Of course, even without a tag or branch, old file versions are retained, unless dropped with `unused`/`dropunused`.
So you could even `git checkout $COMMITID`.)
