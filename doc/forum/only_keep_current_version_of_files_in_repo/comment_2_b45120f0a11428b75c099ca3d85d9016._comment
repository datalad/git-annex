The straightforward way to do this is to run periodically on the hard
drive:

	git-annex unused
	git-annex move --unused --from server

If you're using `git-annex sync --content`, you need to use `--all` in
order for it to consider unused content. Otherwise it will only operate
on files in the current branch, and leave other content as-is.
And you will need to run `git-annex unused` still.

If you are using the assistant, it does periodically scan for unused
content and moves them to some repository whose preferred content matches
them.

You're right that using the "backup" standard group will make the hard
drive want the unused content. That's because it wants "`anything`", which
matches files whether they are unused or not.

Any preferred content expression that matches on a filename,
like "`include=*`", makes it not want unused content, which has no
filename.

Or, you can use "`not unused`" in a preferred content expression to
explicitly exclude the unused content.
