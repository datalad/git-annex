Take a look at `git diff --cached bigfile2` and you will see that what has
been checked into git is a git-annex key. 

This is an unlocked annexed file, which is like a locked annexed file but
is represented in git differently.

`git add` adds files locked because the interface that git-annex is using
to hook into it does not let it stage a symlink into git.

You can `git-annex lock bigfile2` to convert it to a symlink.
