Alright I did some reading and experimenting, and it turns out it's the unlocked files. When I use locked files by defaults, git status is as fast as it usually is. I don't fully understand it, but it seems that something about smudging is slow.

Anyway, I can use locked files for most of my stuff, and unlocked files for only active projects.
