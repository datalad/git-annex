Sounds like the Android repository is not uploading the file contents to
someplace where the Linux repository can download them from. So the first
step is to look at what remotes the Android repository is configured to
use, and see if it's successfully sending files to those. And then check if
the Linux repository is able to get files from those same remotes.
