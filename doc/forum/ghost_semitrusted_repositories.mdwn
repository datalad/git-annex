I had one repo on HDD and another in an USB drive. After mount point changed, I went to the HDD repo folder and tried to use git remote-set url to point it to the new location, however I think I ended in a weird state. git-annex info shows this:

usb_papers was the original usb repo, and now a new one [usb_papers] shows. webapp shows only sapo[here] and [usb_papers], the other 2 repos are unknown. I was digging around but couldn't find a way to remove them.
Seems that the webapp managed to use the new URL, but said something about "fixing repo".
Any suggestions?
Thanks in advance.
Best regards,
              Juan
