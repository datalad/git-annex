I don't seem to be seeing the problem you describe in direct mode:

[[!format sh \"\"\"

joey@gnu:~/tmp/r2>git init
joey@gnu:~/tmp/r2>git annex init
joey@gnu:~/tmp/r2>git config annex.largefiles \"largerthan=100kb and not (include=*.c or include=*.h)\"
joey@gnu:~/tmp/r2>git annex direct
joey@gnu:~/tmp/r2>git annex assistant 
joey@gnu:~/tmp/r2>dd if=/dev/urandom of=bigfile bs=1M count=1
1+0 records in
1+0 records out
joey@gnu:~/tmp/r2>echo \"main() { printf(\"hello, world!\n\") }\" > hello.c
\"\"\"]]

At that point, the bigfile was annexed, and the hello.c file was checked into git as a regular file.

Are you sure you have annex.largefiles correctly configured to exclude the files you don't want to be annexed?
