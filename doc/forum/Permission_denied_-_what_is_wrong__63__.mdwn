I just set up one local repo and one remote server repo (accessible via SSH) that are synced with each other. However, when I add a file to the local repo it never appears on the remote repo. From the log:

I suspect there is something with the ssh authentication. I tried to remove all keys from my known_hosts that was related to the server (a handful since I had accessed it at server.local, server.lan, 192.168.1.3, fqdn:2222 etc). My plan was to re-run the setup screen where you enter the details about the remote server, including your username and password, but that step seems unavailable after the initial setup.

How do I fix the issues above?
