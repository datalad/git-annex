I'm using Git Annex Assistant for the first time, trying to get it to mirror a directory of files from my computer to an external USB drive. I've tried setting up the second repo as a "Removable Drive" in the "full backup" repository group. I've also tried putting it in the "client" group. The result is the same, and Assistant doesn't backup any of my files to the external drive.

What I get in the external drive in the directory that should contain the repo are the set of files "annex, objects, refs, config, HEAD" and they are NOT in a .git subdirectory. Aside from this I don't see any of the files Git Annex Assistant says it has synced. As this is my first time using the Assistant, I don't know if this is a bug, or if I'm just using it incorrectly. If anyone knows what is going on here, please share.
