`git-annex unused` finds files that are not used by the heads of any
branches or tags. These files may still be referred to in individual
commits in git history, or there could be no commits at all that 
refer to them. It's up to you to decide whether these are really
"unused" or not.

git-annex doesn't currently have an concept of file age. You can
look at git history to find that out, but it's quite expensive 
to do that for a lot of files, and so a --older-than option
would make it pretty slow.
