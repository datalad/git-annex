For [the workshop](https://cfp.tuebix.org/tuebix-2023/talk/THBBK7/) I'll host on Saturday I'm still wondering how to make a quick'n'dirty publicly accessible git-annex repo where all participants can just push and pull and do git annex stuff with.

Options:

- Use one of my servers, make a new user, add all of the participants' ssh keys (works)
- Make a https/git protocol git server without auth (no annex possible, right?)
- Use the assistant to set up local pairing and have it do the key setup (should work, though I don't know if it's reliable in that uni WiFi)

Any more ideas?
