Yes, it's safe to enable this build flag. It makes the `git-annex p2phttp`
command work, but users still have to choose to run that server.

The only reason it's a build flag is that the version of servant needed is
not available in some old build environments. The flag actually should be
enabled by default when the necessary dependencies are installable
(in the case of a cabal build) or installed (in Debian's case).
