If you are building on debian stable the issue is probably the version of
stm bundled with ghc being too old. This build flag needs stm 2.5.1
(also warp 3.2.8 and warp-tls 3.2.2)

I've applied a patch that will let the build flag work with older versions
of stm (commit [[!commit 3a53c6012101dcb76786ee497ca4223a8e28ceab]]).
