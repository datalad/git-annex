I looked at the code that creates the paths for the rsync command on Windows.
And it is using Cygwin style paths. However, the rsync version that is bundled with
git-annex on Windows is taken from the MSYS2 distribution. This uses different path
convention for drive letters (simply `/c` and `/d` for `C:\` and `D:\` etc..)

I created a quick fix by adding a toMSYS2Path function and using that for rsync on Windows.
I fix can be found here: <https://github.com/pkitslaar/git-annex/commit/6cd134ade1cf5b03259d04779e2767a07a2f6014>

For me this works when I locally build git-annex and I can now \"get\" files from repositories on another drive.
