Hello,

I have 3 repos, desktop, external and server. desktop and server are sometimes connected, sometimes they should sync using the server. I want to do it manually without the assistent, since I love to learn it that way before I let the assistent do the work.

client and desktop are "wanted standard" and "group client". server is "group transfer".

desktop and server have each other and server in their remotes. server has no remotes.

Is this setup fine that way?

How to use it with the transfer repo?

"git annex sync && git annex copy --to server --auto" after changing files?
"git annex sync && git annex copy --from server --auto" to update?

Will the on the server automatically be dropped? Or do the server needs to have a active role, i.e. called via ssh?

Thanks!
