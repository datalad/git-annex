Little bit of both I think. Pictures uploaded by it are visible on flickr. You can configure a [[preferred_content]] expression so the flickr remote only wants *.jpg etc. Any other file is wrapped inside an image so flickr will accept it. It would probably be a good idea to configure git-annex to `untrust` your repository if using it this way.
