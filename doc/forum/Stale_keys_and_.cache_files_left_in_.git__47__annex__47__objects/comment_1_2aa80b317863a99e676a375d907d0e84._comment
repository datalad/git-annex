I cannot see a way that eg, `dropunused` could leave empty object directories. The few functions that remove content from a repository call `cleanObjectLoc` to prune the empty directories that result. Of course, the empty directories can be safely removed.

IIRC older versions of direct mode might have made stale .cache and .map before. They can be deleted if you're not using direct mode.

The only way I can see that a dash could come before the 'm' and the mtime is if the mtime were negative. I don't know how that would happen, but the code has certainly never put a dash there, and
