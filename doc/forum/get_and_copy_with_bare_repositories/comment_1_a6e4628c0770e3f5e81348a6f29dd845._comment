git-annex commands only operate on files in the currently checked out working copy. You can send files to/from bare repos from non-bare repos. But you cannot do anything with them inside the bare repo, just as regular git doesn't let you commit inside a bare repo.

There is talk about [[todo/add_-all_option]], which would be usable in bare repos.
