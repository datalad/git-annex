The version info you posted shows that your git-annex is not built with
support for S3. The "remote types" line should list S3 and does not.

If you got this from a distribution, could you let the distribution know
that they are building git-annex without S3 support?

If you built it yourself, you probably built it without the haskell aws
library installed, or with some dependency issue that prevented that
library from being used.
