Indeed after getting git-annex from https://downloads.kitenet.net/git-annex/OSX/current/10.10_Yosemite/git-annex.dmg my problem was solved. Turns out the version from Homebrew-cask doesn't support S3 and I vaguely remember that it was the case first time I tried.

Thank you for the help and for the great piece of software
