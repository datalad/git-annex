unfortunately, it is not working on the computer where ssh was not working
I click an got annex and nothing seems to open
I try to go on the system logs but I see nothing really obvious. The only log that may be related would be : 
15/12/13 10:46:23,230 Dock[166]: find_shared_window: WID 21425
15/12/13 10:46:23,230 Dock[166]: CGSGetWindowTags: Invalid window 0x53b1

if you tell me where to look at I can give you something more useful.
