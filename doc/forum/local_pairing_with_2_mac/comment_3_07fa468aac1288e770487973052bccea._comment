It's not a firewall or network problem, what you pasted earlier shows that the ssh-keygen command bundled in the git annex dmg is trying to use a symbol that is not present in your libSystem library.

I am puzzled why ssh-keygen apparently works on one of your macs and not on the other, if they indeed both have the same build of git-annex installed.

Please paste output of `otool -L /Applications/git-annex.app/Contents/MacOS/bundle/ssh-keygen` on the mac with the problem.
