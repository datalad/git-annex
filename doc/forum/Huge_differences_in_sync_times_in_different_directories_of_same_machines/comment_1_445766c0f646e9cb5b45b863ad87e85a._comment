Ooops, the formatting got all messed up. Here it is again:

I am confused by the differences in the time between updates of different
repositories in the same machines and of the same repository in different
machines. I am using the assistant (in all machines, 
'git annex assitant --autostart').



For instance, I have three machines synced as

A <-> B <-> C

and I have two directories being synced. The configuration (except for
directory names) is the same and looks like



    [annex]
            uuid = something
            version = 5
            direct = true
            autoupgrade = true
            autocommit = true
            startupscan = true
    [remote \"machine_repo\"]
            url = ssh://xxxxxx/~/repo/
            fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/machine_repo/*
            annex-uuid = xxxxxxxxxxxxx
    



I modify or add a file in one of the directories in A, and it quickly
(less than 30 seconds) appears in B and shortly after that in C.

In another directory, however, more than 30 minutes can go by without C
ever changing (even if B gets the change almost immediately). Looking at
the logs I cannot understand what is happening. This is the case of a
file, ```A_sentinel_file_A ```, created at 01:46.

In B (where it appears almost immediately)  I can see

And in C (the machine with IP 123.456.789.101, above)  I can see

Why did Machine C did not show the updated file at 01:47, which is when, I
think, machine B pushes it there? Or at 02:17 when both machines again
seem to talk to each other? Regardless, at 02:27 the file still was not
there. Yes, of course, if I issue a

```
    git annex sync --content
```

then the file is shown in Machine C. But I should not need to do that.



In contrast, as I said, there is another directory, with identical
configuration, where these things do not happen and changes show
immediately (both directories, for now, only have tiny test files).
