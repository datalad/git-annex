I am confused on how to invoke the web app. I am learning how to use this tool, however I don't feel quite confident yet. I wanted to test out the web app, to play around with configurations and auto syncing, however I stumbled over this:

    ➜  ~  git annex help webapp // works fine
    ➜  ~  git annex webapp
    Invalid argument `webapp' // uhh what.

git-annex-webapp didn't work either.

I installed with brew. El Capitan, latest update as of right now.
