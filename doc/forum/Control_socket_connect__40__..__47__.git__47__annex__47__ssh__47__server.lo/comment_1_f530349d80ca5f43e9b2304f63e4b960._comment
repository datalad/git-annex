I don't know why ssh is failing to connect via the socket file like that.
Generally when a socket file like this exists, there is a background ssh
process that is servicing connections to it. It may be there was some
problem with that process.

git-annex interprets ssh failing as the ssh server not having git-annex
installed, even though in this case it's some other problem. I have made
some changes that improve this, so in this situation it should not set
annex-ignore again, but will instead complain that it cannot connect to the
server.
