@justin, I discovered that \"git annex describe\" did what I wanted

@joey, yep that is the behaviour of \"tahoe ls\", thanks for the tip on removing the file from the remote.

It seems to be working okay for now, the only concern is that on the remote everything is dumped into the same directory, but I can live with that, since I want to track biggish blobs and not lots of small little files.
