Hey Jimmy: how's this working for you now? I would expect it to go slower and slower since Tahoe-LAFS has an O(N) algorithm for reading or updating directories.

Of course, if it is still fast enough for your uses then that's okay. :-)

(We're working on optimizations of this for future releases of Tahoe-LAFS.)

I'd like to understand the desired behavior of store-hook and retrieve-hook better, in order to see if there is a more efficient way to use Tahoe-LAFS for this.

Off to look for docs.

Regards,

Zooko
