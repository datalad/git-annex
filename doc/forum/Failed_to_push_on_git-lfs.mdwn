Hi,

I've setup a remote on Github with LFS enabled. Running `git-annex sync --content` failed to push on the main branch :

```
pull lfstest 
From github.com:myuser/myremote
 * branch            HEAD       -> FETCH_HEAD
ok
push lfstest 
Everything up-to-date
To github.com:myuser/myremote.git
 ! [rejected]        main -> main (non-fast-forward)
error: failed to push some refs to 'github.com:myuser/myremote.git'
hint: Updates were rejected because the tip of your current branch is behind
hint: its remote counterpart. Integrate the remote changes (e.g.
hint: 'git pull ...') before pushing again.
hint: See the 'Note about fast-forwards' in 'git push --help' for details.
ok
```
Is this an expected behaviour ? Is it possible to correct the push failure ?

Thansk in advance
