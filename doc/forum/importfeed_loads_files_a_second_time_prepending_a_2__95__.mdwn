I recognize that git annex importfeed is reloading old files for a second time while prepending the file name with "2_".

So if there is a podcast file called "foo_bar_in_baz_20170101.mp3" it now imports the same file again naming it "2_foo_bar_in_baz_20170101.mp3".

As I cannot imaging that the feed provider is renaming the files I guess that something else is triggerin this behaviour. Any ideas?

TIA
