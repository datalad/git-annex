I actually didn't originally consider this, but it turns out I have wonderful users, and you're at least the second to consider this case.

So the released git-annex version does already verify the checksum when doing a migration. However, as I was checking this, I noticed 
I had left a window between the verification and the generation of the new key for the migration. It's pretty unlikely a file would get corrupted just as it was being migrated, but that's no excuse. I've committed a change that reverses the order; so it generates a new key and then verifies the old one.
