I installed the Windows git-annex, and had to run the following command from Git Bash (in Admin mode) in order to get git to see git-annex:

$ ln -s /C/Program\ Files\ \(x86\)/Git/usr/bin/git-annex.exe git-annex.exe

Was this 
1) a known install issue that I missed somewhere?
2) a failure in my particular installation?
3) or was I supposed to put C:\Program Files (x86)\Git\usr\bin in my Windows path?

Wasn't sure if we needed a docs update...
