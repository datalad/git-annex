`git-annex p2phttp` does update the git-annex branch itself when recieving
files. And generally, any time git-annex stores an object in a repository, 
it updates the git-annex branch accordingly.

So, you can fetch from the remote and learn about those objects,
and then `git-annex unused --from=$remote` will show you unused objects in
the remote.

When running `git-annex unused` on the local repository, it does list all
objects in the local repository. So if an object somehow does get into the
repository without a branch update, it will still show as unused.

There is no way to list all objects present in a remote. Special remotes
are not required to support emumeration at all. So, if an object got sent
to a special remote, and the git-annex branch record of that was lost,
there would be no way to find that unused object.
