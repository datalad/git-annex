`git-annex examinekey --format='${bytesize}\n'`

Or `git-annex examinekey --json` and use the `bytesize` field.

(You will probably want to use `--batch` to keep a single examinekey
process running, for speed.)

Note that not all keys have a known size. Usually keys without a known size
were added with eg `git-anex addurl --fast`. Encrypted keys also won't have
a size field. 

Also, when chunking is used with a special remote (without
encryption), each chunk is a key, with its size field set to the total size
of the original key. In that case there is a separate chunk size field,
although the last chunk may be smaller than its chunk size field.
If it would be useful, examinekey could have something added to it to
indicate when a key is a chunk key, and show the chunk size.
