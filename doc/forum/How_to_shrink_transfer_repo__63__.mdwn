Hello,

I have two repositories (Asaru and Horus) that are both ```group=client``` and ```wanted=standard```. The other one, Astarte is ```group=transfer``` and ```wanted=standard```. Pretty standard I think.

```
repository mode: direct
trusted repositories: 0
semitrusted repositories: 5
        00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001 -- web
        00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000002 -- bittorrent
        58001764-966d-4076-ae99-4ef6de25df39 -- Asaru [here]
        8165bdf1-907e-4bbe-9c35-22fbf6f8cb00 -- Astarte [astarte]
        cca0c3c8-593a-4395-936c-1093f0f762e8 -- Horus
untrusted repositories: 0
```

I always sync on the two client repos like that ```git annex add . && git annex sync --content```. The transfer repo is growing larger and larger. ```git annex dropunused N``` says, that it ```could only verify the existence of 0 out of 1 necessary copies```.

What is the best way to clean up the transfer repo?

1. Make the two client repos trusted? The three repos have been created manually, not through the assistant. Is that what the assistant does, too?
2. Try to get the two client repos into touch with each other and try to use ```dropunsed --from=astarte```?

What is the recommended way for that?

Thanks,
Florian
