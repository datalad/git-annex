I have not looked into this particular S3 feature, since I see little point
in using it. git-annex can encrypt files client-side before sending to S3,
which is much better.

However, you can probably configure git-annex to send the header.
See the `x-amx-meta-*` option documented in [[special_remotes/S3]].
If the header was named encryptplz and needed to be set to
"canhazsecurityburger", you would enable it with something like:

	git annex enableremote mys3remote x-amz-meta-encryptplz=canhazsecurityburger
