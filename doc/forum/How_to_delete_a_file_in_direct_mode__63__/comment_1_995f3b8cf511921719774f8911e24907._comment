**direct** mode gets its name, because you can **direct**ly operate on files
with commands like "rm" or "mv /tmp".

So, to delete a file, you use such a command as you normally would.

`git annex status` can be used in direct mode since `git status` does not
work.

Perhaps you should read the documentation: [[/direct_mode]]
