Your files should be on the removable drive but the file structure and file names are following git annex logic and is not meant to be human readable.

The default assumption (which I question) is that you will use the removable drive to transfer files between git-annex repositories. So by default you cannot read the files on devices that do not have git-annex installed.

You can configure git-annex to do what you want using the `post-receive` hook. It's a bit complicated and might leave git-annex hogging your drive when you wan't to eject it but see the following:

 - [[forum/USB_backup_with_files_visible/]]
 - [[forum/Can't_get_git-annex_merge_to_work_from_git_hook/#comment-d93181e69b8bea54bc03cb335dd1d7c8]]

The last post on that second link tells you exactly what to put in the `post-receive` hook in the .git/hooks folder on your removable drive.
