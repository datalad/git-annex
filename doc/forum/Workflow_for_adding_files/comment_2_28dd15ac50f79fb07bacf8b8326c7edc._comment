Just to be sure I understood the topic, this would be achieved in putting the repo in the manual transfer group?

manual

This gives you nearly full manual control over what content is stored in the repository. This allows using the assistant without it trying to keep a local copy of every file. Instead, you can manually run git annex get, git annex drop, etc to manage content. Only content that is already present is wanted.

The exception to this manual control is that content that a client repository would not want is not wanted. So, files in archive directories are not wanted once their content has reached an archive repository.

present and ($client)

(Where $client is a copy of the preferred content expression used for clients.)
