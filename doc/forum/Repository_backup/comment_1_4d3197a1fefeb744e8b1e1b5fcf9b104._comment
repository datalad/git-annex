The best way is to make a git remote and let `git-annex sync`
sync with it. You can put the git remote on github, gitorious, any
server with ssh, any server with rsync, a local backup drive, etc.

Special remotes are key/value storage; this is not a very good
match for the access patterns needed for a git remote.
