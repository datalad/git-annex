Storing a tarball of the .git repository as a file inside the repository
presents a chicken and egg problem when it comes to restoring it. You'll
have to find the object file that git-annex has stored in the special
remote. If the special remote is encrypted, you may not be able to decrypt
it without the key stored in the repository. Etc.

Better to make a clone of the git repository elsewhere.
