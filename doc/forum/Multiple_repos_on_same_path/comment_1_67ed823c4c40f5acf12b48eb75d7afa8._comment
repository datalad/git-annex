My way of dealing with this is to create a symlink in the root directory that point to the root directory, like

[[!format sh \"\"\"
$ cd /
$ sudo ln -sv . compname
[sudo] password for sunny: hunter2
'compname' -> '.'
$ ls -l compname
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 1 May 12 14:52 compname -> .
$
\"\"\"]]

where `compname` is the hostname for the computer. Now you can create paths like

[[!format sh \"\"\"
git remote add comp-a /comp-a/home/my_user/data/repo
git remote add comp-b /comp-b/home/my_user/data/repo
\"\"\"]]

This is also useful in other scripts where fetching data from the right directory on the wrong computer is bad. Also, this is a cheap way for a script to determine which computer it's running on:

[[!format sh \"\"\"
test -L \"/comp-a\" && echo Running on computer comp-a
\"\"\"]]
