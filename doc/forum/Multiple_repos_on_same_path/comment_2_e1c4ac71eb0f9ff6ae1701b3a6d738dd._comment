sunny256 has a nice approach with the symlinks to make the paths
to the remores explicitly contain the machine name.

However, if you want to keep it simple, it's perfectly fine for a
remote's path to point to a directory which has different
repositories mounted on it at different times. I do this in my own
removable media drives, so the "host" remote uses /home/joey/sound,
for example.

This is safe to do because git-annex always checks the UUID of the
remote before using it. For a local path like this, it will automatically
update the cached annex-uuid of the remote when it finds a repo with a
different UUID mounted. (For a path to a repo on a remote server, it uses
other methods to verify that it's accessing the repo with the UUID it
expected.)

The only thing I'd be careful about doing is switching the repository that
is mounted at a path with another one while git-annex is running, since it
only checks at startup and won't notice the substitution and could get
confused.
