My use case is that I'm organising my media in a staging area called **uploadme/**.

At this staging area, I add all the media into git-annex and then I go to work pruning, editing & [adding metadata](https://github.com/muennich/sxiv/blob/master/exec/key-handler#L29).

# Pruning

If I find an image I don't like I move it to `/tmp`.

I expected to maybe type `git status` to see the missing file and later confirm that I don't want it. But when I type `git status` I get:

    X1C3:~/media/uploadme$ git status
    fatal: This operation must be run in a work tree

What should I be doing?
