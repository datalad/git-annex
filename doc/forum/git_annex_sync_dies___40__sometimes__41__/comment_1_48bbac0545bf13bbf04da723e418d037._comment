Since this seems to be a problem with ssh connection caching, you can disable that:

git config annex.sshcaching false

Seems like the problem would be in the version of ssh you have installed on your linux client. Or possibly some interaction between its version and the server's version. 

Since linux 2.6.32 is quite old, I'll bet you have an old ssh too.. what version?
