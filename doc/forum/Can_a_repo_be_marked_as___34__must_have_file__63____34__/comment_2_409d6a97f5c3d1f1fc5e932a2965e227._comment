Cost settings have nothing to do with this.

[[Preferred_content]] can be configured to include specific files
that you want to have in the repository, by matching on the filename.
For example:

	git annex wanted . "include=somefile or include=otherfile or include=*.mp3"

Putting the repository in the backup group is similar to setting
"include=*"
