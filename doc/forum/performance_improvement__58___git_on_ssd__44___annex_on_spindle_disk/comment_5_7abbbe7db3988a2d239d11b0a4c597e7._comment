I had my git annex directory on a ssd and .git/annex on a hdd (using a symlink). I got errors when adding files because a move failed. I forgot to copy the error message. When I had .git/annex/objects on a hdd, everything worked as expected, there were no problems.

So what exactly will go wrong if I only have this one subdirectory on another filesystem?
