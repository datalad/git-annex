I'll give it a try as soon as I get rid of this:

    % git annex fsck
fatal: index file smaller than expected
fatal: index file smaller than expected
    % git status
fatal: index file smaller than expected
    %    

And no, I am not sure where that is coming from all of a sudden... (it might have to do with a hard lockup of the whole system due to a faulty hdd I tested, but I didn't do anything to it for ages before that lock-up. So meh. Also, this is prolly off topic in here)
