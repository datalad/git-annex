Even if you remove the information from the remote log, it would still be
there in the git history of the file.

The thing to do, then, is to not store those capabilities in git at all.

If you have a use case for using tahoe without storing the capability in
git, we could talk about implementing that. 

I don't see how it would be useful to store content in tahoe if you can't
get it back out, so seems that some form of encryption would need to be
involved. Perhaps it could encrypt it using your gpg key or something?
