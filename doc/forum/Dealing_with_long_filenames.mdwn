- External HD A: annex (contains files with long paths)
- External HD B: annex (synced with A, doesn't have the contents for files with long paths)
- laptop HD: annex     (syncing with B fails: paths too long)

How should I resolve this? 

- Can I rename the broken symlinks on B to shorten the paths, and then sync to the laptop? Would this be propagated to A when it's connected again?
- Can I `git rm too/long/paths` on B and then sync?
