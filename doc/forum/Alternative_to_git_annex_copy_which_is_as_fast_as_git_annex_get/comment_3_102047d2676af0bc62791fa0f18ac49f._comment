I'm running v6.20170519 on Fedora. Syncing between my desktop and my external drive (USB3).

When I do the following:

1. desktop$ git annex sync usbdrive
2. desktop$ git annex copy --fast --to usbdrive

The output shows every single file in the respository followed quickly by an OK. Output-wise it's no different than if i omitted the --fast flag. 

However, when I do the following, 

1. usbdrive$ git annex sync desktop
2. usbdrive$ git annex get .

The only output is the files being copied over. It also appears to be faster for me than a copy.

I feel like i'm missing something basic or some step? Is copy --fast doing the same amount of work as get but just displaying more output?
