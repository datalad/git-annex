I tried git annex copy --to desktop from my laptop:

without --fast, I see a \"(checking desktop)\" line
with --fast, I only see the lines corresponding to transfer between files.

Given that I don't see a \"checking\" line when I do this with my usb, I assume that it's not actually checking. However, I'm puzzled by the difference in output between the USB and the SSH scenarios.

I still feel like I have a basic misunderstanding here, and I apologize in advance.
