The behavior is different when the remote repository is on the USB drive,
because git-annex knows it can quickly check if the remote really contains
a file, and so it always checks it, even with --fast.

I'm not sure if you're actually seeing a significant speed difference, or
are psycholicically feeling it's slower since it outputs more. Perhaps you
should time it.
