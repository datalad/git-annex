Well, are there any files in your repository (outside .git) that
are still symlinks to content in .git? If not, you know that
every file in the repository's working tree has been unannexed
ok.

The remaining files in .git/annex/objects are not unused, so some branch or tag
must refer to those files.

You might try running `git log --stat -S'KEY'`
where KEY is the basename name of one of the files in .git/annex/objects.
This will find commits to the repo that refer to that object, so you'll
know where it was used and what filename corresponded to it.
