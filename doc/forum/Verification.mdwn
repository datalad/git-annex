Hi,

I have a simple Client Mac <> FullBackup on remote SSH <> Client On Mac setup which seems to work great.

I have 2 questions :
- Whenever a new file is created or changed it can takes a few hours until the second client gets the file. Is this normal ?
- How Can I make sure, that all the files are on the FullBackup ?

Many thank !
