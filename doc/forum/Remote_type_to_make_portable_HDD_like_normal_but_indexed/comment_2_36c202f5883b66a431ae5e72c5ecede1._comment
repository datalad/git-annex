Suggest you use git-remote-gcrypt to encrypt the git repository stored on
the backup drive. This will encrypt the whole git repository with
your gpg key, and git-annex can also use it as a remote, and will encrypt
the annexed files stored there too.

See [[tips/fully_encrypted_git_repositories_with_gcrypt]].
