Well my idea wasn't to have only this in the preferred content. You
can use \"or\" expression.

That said, I've just check the manual, and it seem that there is no --in for
preferred content... But you could add your usb repos say to the
archival group (git annex group usb archival), Then use something like
like `\"include=* and ( exclude=*.mov or not inallgroup=archival )\"`
(this is untested, but I hope you get the idea).

With such a preferred content, you local repository should get (and
keep) the .mov not in usb, and should drop them when they are send
there.
