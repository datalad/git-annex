The assistant re-checks preferred content as rarely as it can get away with,
since that can be an expensive process. Basically, it checks it when
starting up, and when a remote is added or edited, and when it detects
certian kinds of divergences between the local repository and a remote.

I agree that it's not possible to express an expiry using a preferred
content expression.

What would work better is if you can move the old files to some other
directory via a cron job or whatever means. Then it's easy to configure it
not to want files in that directory.
