There have been some problems some time ago with the symlink bit getting
lost on information in the git repository when git-annex makes commits
on a FAT filesystem.

That was resolved in early 2014, and there's a test case to make sure that
particular problem doesn't come back, so make sure
you are not using a git-annex version from before then.

Please check that core.symlinks is set to false. Can check it by running
`git config core.symlinks` and see if it outputs "false"

I have tried to reproduce on FAT, `git annex drop` followed by `git annex
sync`, does not seem to do anything to the symlink here. If you can
reproduce such a thing happening, it's certianly a bug.
