I looked up more information, and this is getting strange. I verified the time of last change for the \"FAT link\" files in my indirect repository. **All** of them say 2016-03-13 11:43:55.3, including the two files that, `git log` says were last manipulated in August 9, and reside in a different area of the repository.

Here is my `git log` has to say about this particular moment:

    commit 2fe1a5834031838563acda9cbdb33ca4c13ec413
    Date:   Sun Mar 13 11:43:34 2016 +0000
    
        git-annex in Toshiba USB HDD

I wish these logs were more descriptive. :-/ If it said the hostname, $PWD and the command line, I could follow along.
