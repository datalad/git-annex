Hello,

I want to use git-annex on a couple of machines that are not under my control (and one that is). For that I use the provided static build, but encountered several problems:

I suppose the first step for command line use is to execute runshell:

On one machine:

flindner@yoko:~> software/git-annex.linux/runshell 
/bin/bash: /lib64/libc.so.6: version `GLIBC_2.11' not found (required by /home/flindner/software/git-annex.linux//lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libreadline.so.6)

Is there anything I can do about it?

On the other machine:

flindner@bladefoam2:~$ software/git-annex.linux/runshell 
bash-4.1$ 

It starts a bare, non-configured shell instance. Can I modifiy and source the script to only set the environment and not start up a new shell?

Another question: If using ssh:// remotes, how can I tell git-annex the first command to set up the environment need in order to execute command via SSH?

Thanks,

Florian
