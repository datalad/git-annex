I contacted the maintainer of the uuid-package and he fixed the issue in the current release, so everythings fine now. and: everything compiled beautifully. 

But to answer your question: I tend to rather compile things myself if I don't find them (or a current enough version) in the repos - but that's purely personal. ;)
