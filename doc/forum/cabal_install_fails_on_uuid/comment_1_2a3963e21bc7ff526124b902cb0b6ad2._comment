That version of the haskell uuid library installs ok on my Debian sid system. Seems to me you have a too old version of the haskell bytestring library, which added `fromStrict` in version 0.10.0.0. Probably `cabal install bytestring` will fix it up for you, but building git-annex from source using cabal is a complicated thing that can go wrong in many ways. Have you considered one of the prebuilt binaries?
