This seems like a reasonable request, so I've opened [[todo/untracked_remotes]]

I will note that if you know the annex.uuid of the previous AAA repository, you can make the new one use that same uuid, just `git config annex.uuid $UUID`. (`git annex fsck --fast` would be a good idea after doing that.)
