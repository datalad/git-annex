You're quite right. that info is stored in `.git/annex/fsckstate`. The timestamp of the file is when the last incremental fsck was started. The contents of the file is the same date, represented as seconds from epoch.

That is only written to when doing an incremental fsck though. A non-incremental fsck does not touch the file.
