I find that it's possible for a repo to not get the content that it wants to have. It happens if the repo only points to remotes that don't have the content.

`git annex get` will fail:

    $ git annex get --want-get
    get foo (not available) 
      Maybe add some of these git remotes (git remote add ...):
      	6ac12bd5-b585-4884-b0fe-a48fdc1b6365 -- b
    failed
    get: 1 failed

But `git annex sync --content` passes, despite not getting any of the wanted content.

Is there a way to make `git annex sync --content` error if it can't fetch wanted content, the way `git annex get` does?
