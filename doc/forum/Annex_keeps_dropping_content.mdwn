I'm experiencing a strange behaviour...

I have a few annexes (local, ssh, gitolite) in my group, some of them  are "manual standard" and some are "backup".

If I 'get' files on my laptop annex and then I 'sync --content' local files are dropped! Local is "manual standard".

Am I doing something wrong?

Thanks
