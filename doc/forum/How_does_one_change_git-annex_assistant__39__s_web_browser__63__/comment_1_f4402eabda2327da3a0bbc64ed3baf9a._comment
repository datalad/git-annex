The web browser is started by running the `xdg-open` program (or just `open` on Mac OS X).

xdg-open, in turn, runs the desktop environment's kde-open, gvfs-open, exo-open. Which browser these run is configured in the desktop environment's settings. Which is my goal for the web app; it should open the same browser that other applications in the desktop use.

When there's no desktop environment in use, xdg-open falls back to some default browser, or to what's configured by the BROWSER environment variable.
