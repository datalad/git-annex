Since I discovered the same behavior mentioned above (git annex webapp
tries to use 'winebrowser'). There is an easy way to work with the difference
between http
url and html files: enter preferences for both:

In ~/.local/share/applications/mimeapps.list:

		[Added Associations]
		..
		x-scheme-handler/http=iceweasel.desktop;
		x-scheme-handler/https=iceweasel.desktop;
		text/html=icewesel.desktop;


		[Default Applications]
		x-scheme-handler/http=iceweasel.desktop
		x-scheme-handler/https=iceweasel.desktop
		text/html=iceweasel.desktop


Your preferred browser might be a different one off course. And I agree that this has to be the most logical place to store that information ever..
