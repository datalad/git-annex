My annex contains several large files that I have unlocked, edited, and committed again, i.e. the annex contains the version history of those files. However, I don't want the history -- keeping the latest version is good enough for me. Running `git annex unused` won't detect those old versions, though, because they aren't unused as old Git revisions still refer to them. So I wonder:

1. What is the best way to get rid of the old versions of files in the annex?

2. What is the best way to detect old versions of files in the annex?

I guess, I could run `git rebase -i` to squash commits to those files into one commit, thereby getting rid of the references to the old copies, but that approach feels awkward and error prone. Is anyone aware of a better way?
