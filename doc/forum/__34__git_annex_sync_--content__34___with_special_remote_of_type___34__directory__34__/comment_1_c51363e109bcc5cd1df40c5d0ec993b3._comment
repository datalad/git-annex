What's going on here is that git-annex does not know that you want to
use "neon" as a repository that transfers content between "ldk" and
"storage". The configuration for "neon" only makes it want a specific
set of files, so it doesn't get other files from "ldk", and so does
not have them to send to "storage".

The solution is to change "neon"'s preferred content settings so it wants
files that are not yet present in "storage".

The [[transfer repository expression|preferred_content/standard_groups]]
is one way to configure preferred content settings so that a repo
will want to download files that other repos want to have. 

	not (inallgroup=client and copies=client:2) and ($client)

But that expression only works for transfer repsitories in between client
repositories. Your "storage" repo is set to be a backup repository.

So, we need something a little bit different.

	not inallgroup=backup and include=*

I think that would work, but I don't see a way to reconcile it with
the configuration you already have for "neon". If neon wants to
"exclude=pictures/* and exclude=video/*" then it will never get those
and so can never send them on to "storage". And if neon wants all
"present" files, then anything it does get for whatever reason
will stay in it, which is just not how a transfer repo needs to work.

What might work better is to set up a separate repository that can talk
to "ldk" and "storage" (as well as perhaps pulling files from "neon"
when available), and make it have that preferred content expression.
