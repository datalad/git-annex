Thank you. I settled on using `present or (not inallgroup=backup) or (exclude=pictures/* and exclude=video/*)`, which seems to be doing what I want. The most important thing to me is that files are transferred to the backup group. Some files might be left in pictures/ or video/ on \"neon\", but I can drop those from time to time if disk space is low.
