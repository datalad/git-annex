Hi,

I have created a git annex repo, added data. I then went to check it out in another location in the following way (my goal is to checkout origin, add a test file, push it back to origin).
 git clone ../test_repo/

   282  17:19   cd test_repo/

   283  17:19   ls

   284  17:19   git status

   285  17:22   git annex init DEV

   286  17:22   touch test.txt

   287  17:22   vi test.txt

   288  17:22   git annex merge

   289  17:22   git annex add test.txt

   290  17:22   git commit -am "test"

   291  17:23   git push origin master git-annex 

However I am getting the following error

To /test_repo/

What am I missing?
