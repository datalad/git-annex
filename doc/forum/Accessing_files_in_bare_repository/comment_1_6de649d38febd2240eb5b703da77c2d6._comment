Do you have git-annex available on the server from the command line?

If so, the easiest way would probably be to clone the repo in git, and do a \"git annex init\" in it.  This would give you a copy of the repo with none of the files in it.  It would be tiny, just full of symlinks, no content.  Then pull down copies of *only* the individual files you need using \"git annex get.\"

Maybe set that repo to \"untrusted\" to make sure other repos don't start depending on it to store copies of files to fulfill numcopies.

When you're done with a copy of a file, just \"git annex drop\" it again so it disappears from this skeletal repo.
