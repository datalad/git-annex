I have git-annex on the VPS. The bare repository is in the directory \"annex\"

From the user's root directory, I execute:

git clone annex/ Documents
Cloning into 'Documents'...
done.
warning: remote HEAD refers to nonexistent ref, unable to checkout.

cd Documents/
~/Documents$ git annex init 'Documents on VPS'
init Documents on VPS ok
(Recording state in git...)

Still, when I try to get a file now, or do a git annex find, nothing shows up.
