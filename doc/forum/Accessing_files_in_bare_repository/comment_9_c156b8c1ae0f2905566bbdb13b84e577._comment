I get the following:

frederik@niihau:~/Documents$ git status
# On branch master
#
# Initial commit
#
nothing to commit (create/copy files and use \"git add\" to track)

And this is the config:

frederik@niihau:~/Documents$ cat .git/config 
[core]
        repositoryformatversion = 0
        filemode = true
        bare = false
        logallrefupdates = true
[remote \"origin\"]
        fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*
        url = /home/frederik/annex
        annex-uuid = 1648a298-27aa-4cb1-xx-xxx
[annex]
        uuid = 4406bd35-9ff7-4008-yy-yyy
        version = 3
[remote \"niihau\"]
        url = /home/frederik/annex
        fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/niihau/*
        annex-uuid = 1648a298-27aa-4cb1-xx-xxx

Not having worked with git before, all this is still very new for me. I have 33M of data in the .git directory, mostly in objects, so it does seem to have synced something already.
