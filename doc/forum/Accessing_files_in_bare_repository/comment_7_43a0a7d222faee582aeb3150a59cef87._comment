That all sounded very plausible, but for some reason it failed to work for me. I went back to basics and tried getting there by replicating steps 1 to 3 of the walkthrough, but also to no aval. I'll still try one more thing - setting up a local repository on the VPS and syncing it to my main one over XMPP. That seems rather convoluted given the bare repository is on the same server, but who knows...
