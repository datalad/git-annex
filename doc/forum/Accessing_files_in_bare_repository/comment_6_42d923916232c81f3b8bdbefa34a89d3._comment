OK, I'm going to guess the problem is there is no \"master\" branch in your cloned repository, because there is no \"master\" branch in a bare remote. (Not sure about this, just guessing.)  Try \"git branch\" in your clone.  If there is no \"master\" branch, that's the problem.

If that's true, the right thing to do would probably have been not to clone from it, but to create a fresh git repo and then set your bare repo as a remote.

You could try doing that -- create a fresh git repo, git annex init it, and then try something like \"git remote add barerepo /path/to/bare/repo\" and then \"git annex sync\" which should pull changes from the bare repo's 'synced/master' branch into your 'synced/master' branch and from there into your master branch, giving you all your symlinks.

If that works you could declare your previous attempt \"dead\" and you'll be good.

It *may* also be possible to just fix the clone you've got by creating a master branch, maybe by branching off of synced/master.  Do a \"git branch\" and see whether synced/master exists, and just try \"git branch master synced/master\" and then \"git checkout master\" and that might do the job!

But I'm just throwing ideas around here, so I hope somebody who actually knows what's going on (joey? are you there?) will pipe up.
