Hello everyone,

my problem is: I have added a Bitbucket gcrypt repository (to be used for metadata only); it works via git-annex sync but the Assistant ignores it completely. I can check from the Bitbucket webpage that the remote repository never gets updated by the Assistant, it only does when i run 'git-annex sync' manually.

## Adding the repository:

    git remote add bitbucket gcrypt::https://bitbucket.org/omissis/basic.git

## Syncing to it is ok:

    $ git-annex sync
    commit  ok
    pull bitbucket 
    gcrypt: Development version -- Repository format MAY CHANGE
    gcrypt: Decrypting manifest
    [...]
    ok
    push bitbucket 
    gcrypt: Development version -- Repository format MAY CHANGE
    gcrypt: Decrypting manifest
    [...]
    ok

## But it doesn't appear at all in the Assistant webapp!

Even if I do "restart daemon".

BTW, adding a local gcrypt repo works fine and it gets synced normally by the Assistant  (after creating a bare Git repo):

    git remote add enc gcrypt::/tmp/enc

My Git-annex version:

    $ git-annex version
    git-annex version: 5.20140412ubuntu1

Anybody has any idea? My use case is that I have a computer behind a very restrictive firewall (only http and https are allowed) and I don't know how to sync it otherwise. I would like to avoid XMPP. Thanks!
