You are not supposed to quote the pattern after 'include='

So, what your expression actually says is if there is a directory
named `"documents/` that contains files ending in `"`,
to apply `not (copies=archive:4)`.

I am kind of surprised that the original situation would lead to any churn
though. It seems like, since it knows there are at most 3, copies, and 4
copies are required, it should be able to skip trying to drop at all.
Instead it does unnecessary work. Filed a bug,
[[bugs/unnecessary_work_when_drop_cannot_possibly_succeed]].
