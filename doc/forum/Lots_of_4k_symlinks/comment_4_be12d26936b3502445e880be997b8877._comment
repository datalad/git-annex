> And I doubt CandyAngel was counting only the sizes of symlinks and not git repos or at least directory inodes to hold all the symlinks.)

In that repository, it is only top level directories (no sub directories) and each directory in it only has symlinks (up to 8000 of them). Directories are **mkdir $(uuidgen -r)**, hence the wildcard for du.

It would be including the directory size to hold all the inodes, but it definitely *isn't counting .git* as this annex spans 3 drives with 6TB of content so far. Well, 6 drives because of \"numcopies 2\" :P

I will calculate this a different way and only count symlinks, when I have access to it again.
