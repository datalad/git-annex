My analysis above assumes no subdirectories.

To leave space for even a single "../" would need to drop to 13 bytes
of hash state. 1/79228162514264337593543950336 chance of 2 files colliding.
Not comfortable with something so worse than md5, and that still doesn't help
when files are 2 directories deep. Droping to 11 bytes for that,
1/1208925819614629174706176 chance is starting to get into could really
happen territory.
