You must have rsynced over the .git/config from A. That is where the UUID
of the repository is stored. So B now has whatever git config settings you
had in A. The reinit fixed the UUID; there could be other things, like
remotes, that are configured wrong. Otherwise, the way you recovered seems
fine.
