I don't think I'm stressing too much. Rather, I'm inquiring about why git-annex is giving me wrong (or at least unclear) output that makes me worry about losing data. I plan to trust git-annex with a lot of important files, and in order to do that I want to make sure it's trustworthy. And that's where the inaccurate key numbers get in the way.

So why do the local and known numbers diverge anyway? Would you consider adjusting the status output to be more accurate, or at least less confusing? I just want to be able to check that every single file in the repo is being backed up.
