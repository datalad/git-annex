I think you're stressing way too much about a number.

It's quite possible for the known and local key counts to diverge while no data is missing. For example:

<pre>
joey@darkstar:~/tmp/test>touch foo
joey@darkstar:~/tmp/test>touch bar
joey@darkstar:~/tmp/test>git annex add foo bar

local annex keys: 1
known annex keys: 2
</pre>
