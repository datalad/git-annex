Alright, thanks. For #1, it sounds like something like Git's hooks/post-receive would be very useful here – can they be used with direct mode, or might git-annex have its own mechanism?

---

Also question 3 – what's the proper way to remove files and have the deletion propagate to all repos? I couldn't find it under \"Removing files\"... Is it `git annex drop --force`? Or should I just `rm` the files and hope that `git annex sync` will pick it up?

The latter seems to work, although the files remain in `git annex unused`, and when I run `git annex dropunused` I again get warnings about \"0 out of 1 copies confirmed\" (so I have to use `--force` again), so it seems like a wrong way?

(These are large read-only video files, I don't care about keeping revision history, only about syncing what I have. I haven't yet done any \"preferred content\" config either...)
