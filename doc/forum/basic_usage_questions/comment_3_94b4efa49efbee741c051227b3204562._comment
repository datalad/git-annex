You can use git's post-receive hook to run `git annex merge` to update a
direct mode repository. See example in
[[tips/setup_a_public_repository_on_a_web_site]].

It's fine to use --force with dropunused if you really want to force
deleting the only copy of a file. git-annex will never delete the last copy
of a file without being forced as a safety measure.
