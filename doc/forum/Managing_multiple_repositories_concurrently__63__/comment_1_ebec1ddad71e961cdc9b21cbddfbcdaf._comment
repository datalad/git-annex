Each repository gets its own git-annex assistant daemon, which is entirely separate from the daemons used by other repositories. 

The only affect that switching which repository is in view in the webapp can have is it can start a daemon running on a repository that for some reason did not already have the daemon running. This could happen if it was not set to autostart on login, for example.
