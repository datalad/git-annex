Hello Joey, I would be very much interested in a walkthrough for direct mode, as detailed as the one currently published. I see the comments in the current walkthrough on some differences to direct mode, but to me it is not obvious what best practices for git-annex use would be in direct mode, with and without the assistant. For a mix of Linux, OS X and Windows installations in the homes, it may also be interesting to see how to best set up the individual machines. Many thanks -
