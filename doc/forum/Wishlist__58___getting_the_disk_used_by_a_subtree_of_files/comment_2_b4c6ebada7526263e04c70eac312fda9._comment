I have a hacked up version of sharebox that does this.. I need to fix it up and push it to github..

the short of it is that you can do

    def calculate_size(path):
        annexfile = os.path.basename(os.readlink(path))
        #SHA256-s2007550713--....
        size = annexfile.split(\"-\")[1]
        return int(size[1:])

to get the size of files.. a 'git-annex du' should be pretty straightforward...
