Hi,

I apologize, but I can't retrace my steps, so my problem is not replicable. The current situation is: 1 main repo and 1 directory/encrypted special remote. From the main repo, I see 0 available copy of the files I need. But when I do a fsck I do see the file. The problem is that the location log does not seem to get fixed after fsck, as I cannot use git-annex get to obtain the file, even after the fsck command. 

Do you have any suggestions for next diagnostic/repair steps?

Thanks a lot for your time and answer!

Vincent
