I'm curious if your repository is using direct mode, and is perhaps on a FAT filesystem, or other filesystem that does not support symlinks?

One way this could have happened is due to a bug in `git annex sync` when used on such a filesystem. I've just fixed this bug in commit 07580dc3dfb2f4d9af9a20bc172cbc32953c49d6
