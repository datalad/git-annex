Hello,

I want to use git-annex on a directory that also other persons, without git-annex use, i.e. modify, add and remove files to.

What need I consider when doing that?

 * Use indirect mode
 * The the .git directory somewhere else?
 * Be prepared that a ```git annex get``` can always bring up checksum problems because someone modified the file

I assume git-annex checksums before pushing to the repo, so that I don't otherwrite someone elses changes.

What else?

Thanks!
