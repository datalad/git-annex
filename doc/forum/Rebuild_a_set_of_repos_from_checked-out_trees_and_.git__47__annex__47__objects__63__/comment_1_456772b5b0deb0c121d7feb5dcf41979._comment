My solution is very roundabout but preserves a lot of information, but did involve buying another drive (and exclusively using v5 indirect mode!).

I create a new repository (on the new drive) which I import all the contents of the \"keyfiles\" (contents of .git/annex/objects). Then I create another repository with the filelinks (symlinks pointing to .git/annex/objects). After adding the keyfiles remote to this, this lets me see which content is present and valid, which got corrupted, is missing etc.

Then I can move the valid content from this recovery annex into a proper annex and try and repair/find the corrupted/missing.
