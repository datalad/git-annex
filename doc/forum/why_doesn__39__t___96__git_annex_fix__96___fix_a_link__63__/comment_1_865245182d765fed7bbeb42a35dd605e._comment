'git annex fix' will only fix symlinks that git is tracking (either staged, or part of the repository) because git-annex uses git-ls-files (or something like that) to get the filenames to fix.

'git annex add' adds the files to the annex and replaces them with symlinks, stages the symlinks but does not commit the symlinks.
