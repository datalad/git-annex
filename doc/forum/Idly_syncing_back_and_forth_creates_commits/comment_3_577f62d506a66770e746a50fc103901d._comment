The built in web and bittorrent special remotes are not at fault.

I don't know what is causing this, but am interested in finding out.
I have not seen this behavior in a long time. Back when git-annex had
direct mode, it did sometimes behave this way, IIRC, but that was a long
time ago. What version of git-annex are you using?

It would be helpful if you could show an example of this happening,
with details about what the commits look like and what the output
is of `git-annex sync` when they are created.

When I try this, it doesn't happen:

	joey@darkstar:~/tmp/bench/bar>cd ../foo
	joey@darkstar:~/tmp/bench/foo>git-annex sync
	commit
	On branch master
	nothing to commit, working tree clean
	ok
	pull bar
	ok
	joey@darkstar:~/tmp/bench/foo>cd ../bar
	joey@darkstar:~/tmp/bench/bar>git-annex sync
	commit
	On branch master
	nothing to commit, working tree clean
	ok
	pull foo
	ok
	joey@darkstar:~/tmp/bench/bar>cd ../foo
	joey@darkstar:~/tmp/bench/foo>git-annex sync
	commit
	On branch master
	nothing to commit, working tree clean
	ok
	pull bar
	ok
	joey@darkstar:~/tmp/bench/foo>cd ../bar
	joey@darkstar:~/tmp/bench/bar>git-annex sync
	commit
	On branch master
	nothing to commit, working tree clean
	ok
	pull foo
	ok

After making a change, it quickly settles down:

	joey@darkstar:~/tmp/bench/bar>date > new
	joey@darkstar:~/tmp/bench/bar>git-annex add
	add new 
	ok                                
	(recording state in git...)
	gijoey@darkstar:~/tmp/bench/bar>git-annex sync
	commit 
	[master f9e0940] git-annex in bar
	 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
	 create mode 120000 new

	pull foo

Making different changes in the two repositories at the same time similarly
settles down quickly, after one merge commit.
