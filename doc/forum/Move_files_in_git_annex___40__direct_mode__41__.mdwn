Hi guys, I have a git annex repo under `/path`.

I ran:

```
cd /path/subdir2
mv ../subdir1/stuff* .
git annex add
git annex sync
```

The I went to another repo (clone of the first) and did:

```
cd /paht1
git annex sync
git annex get .
```

Now I got the stuff from under `subdir2` in my second repo, just that the same stuff is also still under `subdir1` - how do I make git-annex aware of this change?

Also, someone suggested running `git annex watch`
