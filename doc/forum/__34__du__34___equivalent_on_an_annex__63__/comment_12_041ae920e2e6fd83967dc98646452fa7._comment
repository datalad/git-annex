Hey @wzhd,

Thanks a lot for this tool - annexize works like a charm even in tags views!

It's basically solve the most important problem for me:

I can use ncdu for organizing files in my local git annex repository that
does not contain any actual files (only file links), and then just sync
with linked repos that do store those files.
