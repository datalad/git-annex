Wrote a bare minimum [fuse fs](https://codeberg.org/wzhd/annexize/) so that du-like utilities like ncdu, gt5, gdu can be used.

It reads each symlink target, try to get a number after `SHA256E-s`, and pretends it's regular file with that size. `git-annex add`ed files don't need to be locally available.

Files can be deleted but no other operations are implemented.
