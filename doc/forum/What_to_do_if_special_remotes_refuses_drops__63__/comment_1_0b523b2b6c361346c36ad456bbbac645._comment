It could certianly be a bug in the special remote implementation. It's also
possible for some special remotes to intentionally not be able to remove
content (this is the case with the web special remote, and the bup special
remote at least).

You can manually remove the special remote, by editing .git/config and
deleting the stanza for that remote. You may want to run `git annex dead
$remotename` first, if you don't intend to ever use that special remote
again.
