The way autostart works is, the repository gets listed in
`~/.config/git-annex/autostart` -- setting up that file is all that
the webapp preferences does.

`git annex assistant --autostart` looks at that files and gets the
assistant running in each listed repository.

Now, something has to take care of running that command when the system
starts or you log in or whatever. At this point it gets OS dependant.

For example, on Debian, this is handled by the git-annex package containing
`/etc/xdg/autostart/git-annex.desktop`

Sounds like they may have left this file out of the Arch package. 

git-annex's `make install` handles building that desktop file. It only
generates it if run as root, or with DESTDIR set. One or the other should
normally be the case when building a package.

Here's the content of `/etc/xdg/autostart/git-annex.desktop`
