I think, although not sure, that all of this is related of failing/inconsistent ssh calls.

I filed a bug here: https://git-annex.branchable.com/bugs/git-annex_ignores_GIT__95__SSH

The problem is that failure in ssh does not result in proper error messages in git-annex, resulting in inconsistent repositories.
