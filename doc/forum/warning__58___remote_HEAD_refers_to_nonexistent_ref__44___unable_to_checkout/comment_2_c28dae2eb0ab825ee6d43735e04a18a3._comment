After you add a file to a git repository, you have to git commit it. Using git-annex is no different. The walkthrough shows using `git commit`: <http://git-annex.branchable.com/walkthrough/adding_files/>; you can use `git-annex sync` if you prefer.

Permission denied (publickey,keyboard-interactive).
 (merging origin/git-annex origin/synced/git-annex into git-annex...)
 (Recording state in git...)

   Remote origin does not have git-annex installed; setting annex-ignore
</pre>

git-annex uses a heuristic to determine if git-annex-shell is not installed on a remote server: It tries to run it, and if that fails, it tries to run git fetch. If that succeeds it assumes this means it can log into the server, but git-annex-shell is not installed.

Above, that heuristic seems to have failed; you seem to have given the wrong password or something so it didn't run git-annex-shell, but then it was able to log in for the git fetch. 

You will need to run this command to fix it up: `git config remote.origin.annex-ignore false`
