Your status shows that test.txt is deleted.
`git annex get` does not un-delete files, it just gets the *content*
of a file (whether that file is deleted or not).

You can use normal git commands to un-delete the file. Ie, "git checkout
text.txt". If you're using direct mode, you can't use such commands, but
can use "git annex undo" to undo a deletion.

Normally, if you have a bare repo, you'll want to clone it to get a non-bare
repo. I suspect you did something else that resulted in your repo being in
this state were files are deleted.
