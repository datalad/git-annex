Actually, I just removed all annexed files to try out disaster recovery. I stumbled across the `undo` command. Unfortunately, it does not seem available on Ubuntu running version 5.20141125 shipped by vivid (`git-annex: Unknown command 'undo'`).

Am I missing something, or how do I get a version supporting `undo`?

thanks
Andreas
