The gcrypt special remote will work without git-annex being installed
on the server. The server only needs git and rsync. I think the
tip is fairly clear about that when it says

"While this will work without git-annex being installed on the server, it
is recommended to have it installed."

Without git-annex being available on the remote server, some things
like `git annex notifychanges` and content locking during dropping won't
work with that remote. The basics should work well enough to use it that
way.
