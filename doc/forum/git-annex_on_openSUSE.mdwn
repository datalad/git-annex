I run into some problems installing git-annex on openSuSE:

1) cabal install ends up with the failure:

-->>> ExitFailure 1 network-protocol-xmpp-0.4.6 depends on gnuidn-0.2.1 which failed to install.

2) with the tarball the files are not synchronized, only linked

Here the link to the discussion in a suseforum:

https://forums.opensuse.org/showthread.php/506098-How-to-install-git-annex-on-13-1-2

It would be great to see git-annex in the opensuse repos,
maybe via the open build service, https://build.opensuse.org

Are there other ways to install git-annex on opensuse successfully?

Thanks in advance
