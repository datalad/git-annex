For this to happen, the repository must somehow not be listed in uuid.log,
but the location log for the file includes its uuid. Normally, any time a
git-annex repo is initialized, it gets recorded in uuid.log.

One way that could have happened is if `git annex reinit` was run
with some uuid that was not known in uuid.log. Or, if `git config
annex.uuid` were manually set.

I don't think it's a problem, other than you not knowing where this
repository is -- unless some file is only present in that repository. 

You can run `git annex dead` with the uuid as a parameter to mark it dead,
or you could `git annex describe` with the uuid as a parameter to give
it a description.
