To make git-annex output the key of a file, run: `git annex lookupkey $file`

I don't know if the git-annex key is appropriate for your use-case. If the files never get changed, then it's a nice stable identifier. If ongoing changes are made to a file, and you want to link to the most recent version, the key would not be useful.

You might also look at git-annex's [[metadata]]; you could make up some metadata field and value and attach it to a file, and it would persist as the file was modified.
