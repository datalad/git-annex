Note that you can avoid the trying of multiple keys by doing `git config gcrypt.publish-participants true` -- this is done by default by the assistant when setting up new gcrypt remotes. It needs my branch of git-remote-gcrypt, which is included in the osx app, I don't know which one is being used in brew.
