One of my remotes is S3 (named s3). I used to be able to run

    $ git annex sync s3 --content

But now I'm getting the following error:

    commit  
    On branch master
    nothing to commit, working directory clean
    ok
    git-annex: there is no available git remote named "s3"

My `.git/config` file contains following lines which I would assume mean that the remote is there:

    [remote "s3"]
            annex-s3 = true
            annex-uuid = bd9af194-b736-4114-a689-9a8bf212fb18
            fetch = 
            annex-sync = false

As far as I can tell only change I did was to install newer version of git-annex, currently I have:

    git-annex version: 6.20160418

How do I recover access to that remote?
