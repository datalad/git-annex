I've been improving this code path, so make sure you're current. I just made it wait for longer than the 10 seconds it was waiting before giving up. 

If it still fails, try running `git-annex assistant --debug --foreground`
in one terminal, wait for it to start up, and then run `git annex webapp` in another.
If that still fails, check if `.git/annex/webapp.html` exists.
