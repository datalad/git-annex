Reproduced the same thing on my Pixel 5 with CalyxOS.

My guess as to what has happened is that the arm64 build has been updated
to use a newer version of glibc etc, and that is trying to use a syscall
that the Android kernel is too old to support. (Kernel 4.19 in my phone's
case.)

I suggest you try the Nix-On-Droid installation method instead, if you
don't really need to use termux.
