You can `git annex add` some files and leave others not added, and `git annex sync` will commit only the added ones. 

What is missing is a way to have changed some files that were added, and avoid `git annex sync` committing them. 

There is no technical reason this cannot be supported in direct mode, there is just no user interface built to do it. 

One way is to temporarily bypass the direct mode guard, by using the appropriate git command line option to set core.bare=false temporarily while committing files. Note that it's then up to you to avoid staging the entire content of the file into the index (so no `git commit -a` etc).
