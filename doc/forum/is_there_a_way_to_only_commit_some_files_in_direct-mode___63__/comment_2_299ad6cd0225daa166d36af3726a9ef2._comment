Thanks for the reply!

I tried to commit manually but I got confused by the (recently introduced?) annex/direct/master branch and I am not sure which branch I need to commit/merge/pull/push my changes to.
I also got blocked when pulling from origin fail due to file changes needed to be overwritten.
I see git-annex cleverly merges those in .git/annex/merge folder so I could try doing the same but I am not too confortable doing a large part of git-annex's job...

Is there a simpler way to sync with a remote repository?
