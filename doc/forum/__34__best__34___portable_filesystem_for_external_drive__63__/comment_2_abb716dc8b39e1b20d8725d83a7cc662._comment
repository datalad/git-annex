Locking is not a concern. git-annex can lock files on a FAT
filesystem as well as on any other. (Network filesystems tend to be the
ones with problems with locking.) Lacking permissions do mean that a `rm -rf`
is more likely to delete annex objects, but a removable drive has a real
risk of accidentially being reformatted, or physically damaged, and you can
untrust it if any of those risks are too large.

I do think that a bare repo on a removable drive can work well,
if the point of the drive is to sneakernet data back and forth, or offload
storage. Keep your local clone on the best available filesystem the OS
provides and work in there. Used in this way, FAT is no worse than S3.
