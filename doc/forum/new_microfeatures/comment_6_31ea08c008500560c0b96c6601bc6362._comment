I'm not sure it is worth adding a command for such a small feature, but I would certainly use it: having something like \"git annex fetch remote\" do \"git fetch remote && git annex copy --from=remote\", and \"git annex push remote\" do \"git push remote && git annex copy --to=remote\". And maybe the same for a pull operation?
