ps: concerning the command 'find .git/annex/objects -type f -name 'SHA1-s1678--70....' from my previous comment, it is \"significantly\" faster to search for the containing directory which have the same name: 'find .git/annex/objects -maxdepth 2 -mindepth 2 -type d -name 'SHA1-s1678--70....'. I am just curious: what is the need to have each file object in its own directory, itself nested under two more sub-directories?
