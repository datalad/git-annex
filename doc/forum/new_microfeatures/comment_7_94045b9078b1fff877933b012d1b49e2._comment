My last comment is a bit confused. The \"git fetch\" command allows to get all the information from a remote, and it is then possible to merge while being offline (without access to the remote). I would like a \"git annex fetch remote\" command to be able to get all annexed files from remote, so that if I later merge with remote, all annexed files are already here. And \"git annex fetch\" could (optionally) call \"git fetch\" before getting the files.

It seems also that in my last post, I should have written \"git annex get --from=remote\" instead of \"git annex copy --from=remote\", because \"annex copy --from\" copies all files, even if the local repo already have them (is this the case? if yes, when is it useful?)
