Before dropping unsused items, sometimes I want to check the content of the files manually.
But currently, from e.g. a sha1 key, I don't know how to find the corresponding file, except with
'find .git/annex/objects -type f -name 'SHA1-s1678--70....', wich is too slow (I'm in the case where \"git log --stat -S'KEY'\"
won't work, either because it is too slow or it was never commited). By the way,
is it documented somewhere how to determine the 2 (nested) sub-directories in which a given
(by name) object is located?

So I would like 'git-annex unused' be able to give me the list of *paths* to the unused items.
Also, I would really appreciate a command like 'git annex unused --log NUMBER [NUMBER2...]' which would do for me the suggested command
\"git log --stat -S'KEY'\", where NUMBER is from the 'git annex unused' output.
Thanks.
