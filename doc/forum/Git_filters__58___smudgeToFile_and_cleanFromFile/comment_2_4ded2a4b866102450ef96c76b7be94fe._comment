Thank you for the reference!

I may try to use this trick, but I doubt it would be sufficient for me:

> To avoid the problem, git-annex smudge --clean relies on a not very well documented trick: It is fed a possibly large file on stdin, but when it closes the FD without reading. git gets a SIGPIPE and stops reading and sending the file. Instead of reading from stdin, git-annex abuses the fact that git provides the clean filter with the work tree filename, and reads and cleans the file itself, more efficiently.

I will keep you updated on the progress in this direction.
