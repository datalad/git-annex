Since filter.foo.process was being developed at the same time, they had a
good reason to not accept the patch.

This page tracks ways that the current git interface limits git-annex:
[[todo/git_smudge_clean_interface_suboptiomal]]

Since I've been able to work around most of the problems with the
interface, the main consequences are slightly slower `git add` of large
files and lack of integration with commands like `git stash` that update
the working tree without running any hook. This is minor enough that most
people won't be bothered by it, so implementing a better interface is not a
priority for me.

I would support git's smudge/clean interface being improved, but the benefits
to git-annex are too small to make me want to dive back into implementing
it myself.

(Adding a git hook that runs after `git stash`, `git reset --hard` etc
would interestingly fix the biggest remaining issue in a way that avoids
the issue of improving the interface. Adding hooks is comparatively
easy...)
