This sets `remote.<name>.annex-ignore` to false in the git config.

You would normally only see this if the remote server didn't have
git-annex-shell installed so was only a git repository with no annex. 
If it then got installed, so you were able to use git-annex to store
files there, this makes git-annex try again to use git-annex-shell in
that repository.

The naming is unfortunate since it's not related to upgrading the
repository version at all. I'll rename it to "Convert Repository".
