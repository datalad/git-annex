I did a simple search and it looks like it's already been asked and phrased much better [here](https://git-annex.branchable.com/todo/git-annex-cat/). It's in the todo forum and tagged with `needsthought`. I'm going to add a comment with some of my thoughts and hopefully have a more fruitful discussion there.
