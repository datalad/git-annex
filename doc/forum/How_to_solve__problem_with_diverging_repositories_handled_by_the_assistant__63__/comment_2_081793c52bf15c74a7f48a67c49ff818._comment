ok, now that git-annex has been updated to 5.20140117~bpo70+2 things start flowing again, so it was actually caused by [[http://git-annex.branchable.com/bugs/Jabber__47__xmpp_not_supported_on_Debian_Wheezy_backport/]]. Now there is a certain number of files called 'filename.variant.06b8' for instance. That is a bit messy.

I do not know wheter/how it would be possible to inform the user that something is going wrong, but certainely it would be better to avoid failing completely silently.

It would be useful if the webapp could give more precise information about the files the assistant is manipulating. For instance: \"now uploading file 'bla', updating version last uploaded from 'remote' on 'date'\".
