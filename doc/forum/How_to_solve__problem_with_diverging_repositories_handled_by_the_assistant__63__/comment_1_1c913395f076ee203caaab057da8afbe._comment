In order to check whether this is related to  [[https://git-annex.branchable.com/bugs/Jabber__47__xmpp_not_supported_on_Debian_Wheezy_backport/]] I tried to downgrade git-annex to the previous version that was available on wheezy-backports (git-annex_4.20131106~bpo70+1_i386.deb) but then I get:

    git-annex: Repository version 5 is not supported. Upgrade git-annex.
    failed
