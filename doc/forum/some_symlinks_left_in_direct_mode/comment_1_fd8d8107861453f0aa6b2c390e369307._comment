Well, it's normal to have broken symlinks if the content of a file
is not present. `git annex get` will get the file content
and replace the symlink with it.

If the symlink is not broken, you can run `git annex fsck` on the file
and it will notice and fix this inconsistency. 

Some old versions of git-annex had bugs in direct mode that could result
in files being left as symlinks like that. I have not seen any bugs
lately in that area. If you have a way to get a repository into that
state, file a bug report with a test case.
