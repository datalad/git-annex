Nice script to use recoil, and I imagine similar approaches could be used
to integrate with other search engines.

Note that `git annex metadata --json` yields a format better suited to
machine parsing. Especially because metadata values can contain arbitrary
content, even potentially newlines.

There are plans to eventually make git-annex use a caching database for
things, including metadata. This would automatically get updated whenever there
are changes to the metadata, and SQL queries could then be run against it.
Or, `git annex metadata` queries could boil down to SQL queries and so run
a lot faster than they do now.
