Hi,

I'm trying to figure out if it's possible to have a remote that allows access from _clients without git-annex_. That is a remote type that presents itself as a client repo. I'm probably missing something obvious.

Ideally I'd like to use my Nokia N900 phone as a ssh remote from which I can open files on any computer when the device is connected via usb in mass storage mode. This would allow me to access my files when I'm using a computer at work or at a friends house without installing git-annex. The phone has an ext3 partition so links are possible. Naturally I'd have to ensure the files I want are on the device before I leave the house.

I'd also like to be able to scp files from my ssh remote when on git-annex less devices. Unfortunately the ssh/rsync repo presents no links or normal filenames.

Git annex, and the assistant is working really smoothly between my local computers and my server on the internet. Setting things up with the webapp is super simple. Great work!
