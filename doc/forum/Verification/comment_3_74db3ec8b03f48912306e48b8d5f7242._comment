Also, I noted a difference between encrypted (gcrypt) repos and unencrypted repos. The second ones have the other icon saying that it is live messaging. The encrypted one have a standard icon.
Is it a technical limitation that encrypted repos can not live message ? And could it be the reason why the sync is not happening itself until i manually choose \"sync\" from the menu ?
