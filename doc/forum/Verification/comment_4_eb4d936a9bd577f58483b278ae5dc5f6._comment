You can use `git annex fsck` to verify your repository contents.
If you want to verify a local repository, the best thing to do is
to run `git annex fsck` there. If you cannot do that, you can use
`git annex fsck --from remoterepo --fast` to verify a remote. If you leave
off the --fast it will download all file contents to completely verify
them.

I suggest you read git-annex's documentation, there is plenty of it about
using git-annex fsck to verify repositories.
