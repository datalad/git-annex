Thanks for this speedy answer !

I have version 5.20150219 installed on all the clients and on the server.
The ssh server is a gcrypt repository. Could this be the reason of the clients not being notificated of the  changes ??

Also, in theory, some file on one of the repositories could get corrupted, deleted, whatever. How can I make the repo check if everything is like intended on the other repos ? 
For example, I made a test renaming a file within the objects directory on the remote ssh server and ran git annex fchk, but it reported nothing...

Many thanks again !
