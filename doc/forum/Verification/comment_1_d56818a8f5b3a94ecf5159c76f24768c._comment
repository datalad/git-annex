Well, it depends on how big the files are, but taking a few hours to sync
might indicate that your repositories are not immediately notifying
one-another of changes. It might be falling back to polling every half
an hour for new changes.

You could fix that by setting up XMPP, or better, by installing git-annex
5.20140421 or newer on the SSH server; then the clients would immediately
notify when there are changes.

You can find out if all files are present on the server by running
`git annex find --not --in $server` on one of the clients. Any files
it prints out have not been stored in the server.
