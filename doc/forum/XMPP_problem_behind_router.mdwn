I'm trying to configure a jabber account for use with git-annex, but it seems that something's wrong as soon as I try to go through my router (wired or wireless).  Compared to directly connecting to my modem, wireshark shows a lot of TCP retransmissions, eventually resulting in "Unable to connect to the Jabber server. Maybe you entered the wrong password? (Error message: host gmail.com:5222 failed: connect: timeout (Connection timed out))" in the webapp.

I've tried to configure the account both in the webapp and manually in the .git/annex/creds/xmpp file, but it doesn't seem to make a difference.  It's able to connect if I directly connect it to my modem, so I'm fairly sure it's not a problem at my computer or with the credentials.  It doesn't appear to be a problem at the firewall on the router, but I could certainly be missing something.  Are there some other tests I could try to narrow down the problem?
