I think that would be a great idea. If someone can tell me how to do that
on Windows.. 

Note that even if you opened such a file, and made a change, and then
saved it, this would at the worst result in a new commit being made.
Other repositories that have a copy of the file would not lose their
copy, at least not immediately (`git annex dropunused` might eventually
remove it). So, to recover from such a mistake, it suffices to run `git
annex undo $file`.
