I've recently added built-in bash completion to git-annex, enabled by the
`bash-completion.bash` file. It knows about all sub-commands,
and all options, and will automatically always be up-to-date with the
argument parser!

Currently, it only works for completing "git-annex", not "git annex".
I have submitted a patch to git's bash completion to make the latter work.
