I don't have bandwidth to watch screencasts, so I can only guess.

My first guess would be that you used `git add` to check the files into a git repository. This will exactly double the disk space, since each file is now stored in .git/ as well as in the working tree. This is a problem that git-annex solves.

If you'd like to provide more information (cut and paste of details is useful), I can perhaps make more informed guesses. Or you could use `du` so see which files are taking up more space than you expect.
