It's now pretty easy to set up a remote on a USB drive so that `git annex
sync` will update the work tree. See 
<https://git-annex.branchable.com/tips/making_a_remote_repo_update_when_changes_are_pushed_to_it/>

However, the assistant does not do this by default when adding repos on USB
drives, due to the likely confusion that setting up such a repo would
cause, as described in my previous comment.
