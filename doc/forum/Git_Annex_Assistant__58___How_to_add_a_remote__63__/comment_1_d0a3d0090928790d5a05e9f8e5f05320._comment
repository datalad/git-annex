You have two choices:

1. Install git-annex on your server. You can then use the webapp to set up a git repository, or use the git repository you've already set up.

2. Don't install git-annex on your server. Select the option in the webapp to use an encrypred rsync repository on your server. (The screen you described the webapp showing had a button to use this option, but you seem to have misread it.)
