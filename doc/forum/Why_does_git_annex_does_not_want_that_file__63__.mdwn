Hello,

I have an repo that uses standard groups / wanted expressions:

    % git annex wanted . && git annex group .               
    standard
    archive backup

I use the two groups so that the repo wants anything (backup) and is recognized as an archive repo, so other repos drop files in archive/.

    % git annex drop fortune
    drop fortune (checking S3...) ok
    (recording state in git...)

fine. But:

    % git annex get --auto

does nothing. I do not understand, why the repo does not want the file. Same for git annex sync --content.

    % git annex whereis fortune
    whereis fortune (3 copies) 
            19317658-7d40-4412-94ba-a2525e625283 -- Asaru
            2f41eb74-5f33-4737-bb6b-1cd31dd67ee5 -- External
            728648bf-5276-4a86-9df9-9a30f4783027 -- [S3]
    ok

Asaru is standard/client, S3 is standard/backup and External has no group / wanted set.



Thanks,
Florian
