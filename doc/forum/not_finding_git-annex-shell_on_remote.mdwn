I have set up an annex on a remote machine and I am connecting via ssh.  But, since it is a managed machine, I installed the git-annex binary in my own ~/bin.  Well, when I try 
$git annex sync

I get:
  $git annex sync
(merging origin/git-annex into git-annex...)
(Recording state in git...)
bash: git-annex-shell: command not found

  Remote origin does not have git-annex installed; setting annex-ignore
commit  ok
pull origin 

merge: refs/remotes/origin/master - not something we can merge

merge: refs/remotes/origin/synced/master - not something we can merge
failed
git-annex: sync: 1 failed


The git remote -v looks correct.  So, how do I tell git annex on my local machine where to use $HOME/bin in PATH on the remote machine when syncing  with remotes?
