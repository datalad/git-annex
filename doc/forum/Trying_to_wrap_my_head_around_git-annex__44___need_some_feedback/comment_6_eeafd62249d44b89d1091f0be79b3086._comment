you lost me there. so I'm using the command line on the NAS not the webapp but on the MACbook I do use the webapp.
so when creating a repo through the webapp I chose:  Remote server - Set up a repository on a remote server using ssh. and then I can chose between: Unencrypted repository, Simple shared encryption and Encrypt with GnuPG key

Unfortunately the descriptions aren't quite that self-explanatory. So far I have tested the 3rd option but here files get stored inside .git/annex/objects so I cannot access the files straight away. 
I'll be testing a few more option awaiting a reply here, maybe I'll figure it out on my own. 
The config of hte created repo on the NAS contained this:
[core]
        repositoryformatversion = 0
        filemode = true
        bare = true
        sharedrepository = 1
