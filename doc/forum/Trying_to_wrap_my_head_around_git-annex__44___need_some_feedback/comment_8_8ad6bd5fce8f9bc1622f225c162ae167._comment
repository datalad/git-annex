Thanks for bearing with me Carl, you mention the walkthrough and the command line so lets see:

on my nas I follow the walkthrough:

# mkdir ~/annex
# cd ~/annex
# git init
# git annex init

which yields in a BARE repo:

cat .git/config 
[core]
        repositoryformatversion = 0
        filemode = true
        bare = false
        logallrefupdates = true
[user]
        name = gitannex
        email = gitannex
[annex]
        uuid = 36bca403-027b-4e90-9504-123456789012
        version = 5

So where do I stand now? You mention I need a non-bare repo and suggested to follow the walkthrough. Kinda stuck here now and I really would like to get to use gitannex.


Maybe joey will give some advice?

Would you mind sharing more of your setup? Theory or practical advice welcome :-)


regarding an earlier question of mine, about how the syncing works: 
I understand its not possible to have git-annex running somewhere centrally and have two clients who only access parts of a repo?

i.e. on \"server\" have Documents with subfolder a) and b)  then have 2 clients, i.e. Macbooka and Macbookb which would each only sync the a) respectively b) folders out of the complete repo?
