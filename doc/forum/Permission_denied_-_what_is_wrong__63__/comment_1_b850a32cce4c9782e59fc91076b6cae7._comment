The remote server is rejecting your ssh key to log into it.

If you used the web app to set this up, it will have generated a ssh key
just for this server, and put it in `~/.ssh/git-annex/` on the client.

You need to check your `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file on the server
and make sure that the ssh key is listed in it. Checking the server's
ssh log file may also help track down why it's rejecting the login.
