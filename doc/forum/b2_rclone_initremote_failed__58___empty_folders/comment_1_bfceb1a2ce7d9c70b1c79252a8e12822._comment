Hi, author of rclone's \"gitannex\" command here. Sorry you're running into trouble with it!

Based on the text, that error is definitely coming from [gitannex.go](https://github.com/rclone/rclone/blob/6494ac037fdd7ada2052ae9a8e05d230e7e686b2/cmd/gitannex/gitannex.go#L276).

I believe that my intent was to detect that the following mkdir would fail, and offer up a more specific error message rather than letting it fail.

I don't know anything about Backblaze B2, unfortunately. I suppose we could work around the issue by creating an empty file underneath the place we want the empty directory. Sounds plausible, right?

Would you mind trying to make an empty directory on your B2 remote to verify it fails? Something like `rclone mkdir myremote:newdir`.

And also try touching a file in a new directory to verify it's possible in one go? Something like `rclone touch --recursive myremote:newdir/newfile.txt`.
