I think this is intended behavior when adding with `git add`, or at least it's what I've seen for long enough for me to have forgotten if it ever was different. `git annex add` will create symlinks, as will `git add  && git annex lock`.

If this was actually a small file, you wouldn't see it hashed & copied under .git/annex/objects. You should also see in git log that the change is an addition of some git annex key, not a git blob diff as would be the case for a small file.

NB: I'm just another user, @joey please correct me if this is wrong
