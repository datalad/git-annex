I am in Windows and therefore forced to use direct mode. After reading for a long while I still have not found a way of "git annex get" previous versions. Is this supported? is it only the last version in the repository?

any chance to use indirect mode in Windows? In theory Windows supports NTFS symlinks, why is this not supported?
