Repacking in cygwin towards a smaller packsize did not help. I shrinked it down to 2 MB per packfile, I still got the errors.

When checking the debug output, you can see that git crashes when adding some large-ish .mov files. I'm not even sure if git's supposed to add them or if something went wrong with Windows/DirectMode. I executed git reset to remove pending additions that weren't supposed to be there, but to no avail.

Any ideas on how to fix that?
