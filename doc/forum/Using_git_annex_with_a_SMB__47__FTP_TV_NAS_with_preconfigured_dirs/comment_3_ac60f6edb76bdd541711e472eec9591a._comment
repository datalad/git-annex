I've been experimenting with a direct mode repo on a CIFS mount of the SMB share of the NAS.

Unfortunately, it seems I can't propagate changes made on the laptop to the mount point by issueing a git pull or merge, as it is part of the unsafe commands that don't support direct mode (see details in <http://git-annex.branchable.com/direct_mode/#comment-fca93776b9526341e6aae4fe2c53038c>)... direct mode wouldn't be very useful then : I intend to mirror on the NAS the files I've been managing locally. For instance I will sort my photos in subdirs, on the laptop, and intend to mirror that on the NAS.
