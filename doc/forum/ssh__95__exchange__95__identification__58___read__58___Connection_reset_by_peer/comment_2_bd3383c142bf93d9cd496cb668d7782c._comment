I tried using git-annex on encfs to see if I could reproduce this problem, and I could not get exactly this error, but I certianly did see it cause problems with the ssh connection caching socket.

It would be a good idea to `git config annex.sshcaching false` in repositories stored on encfs. 

Actually, given other reports of problems caused by encfs, it would be a good idea to not use git-annex on encfs. There are better ways to encrypt your files.
