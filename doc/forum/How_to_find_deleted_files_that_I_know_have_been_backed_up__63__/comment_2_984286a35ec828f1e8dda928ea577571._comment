This is a git-annex question. I want to find files that are not in my working tree but are on the backups on my two USB hard drives.


I see in this commit the images that I deleted: <https://github.com/kaihendry/uploadme/commit/c53dbdd9bd7879d68635a2adc81a7bc59a84c5ea>

How can I simply just get a listing of where the copies are?

For example I deleted IMG_4110.JPG.

But when I run:

    X1C3:~/media/uploadme$ git-annex whereis IMG_4110.JPG
    git-annex: IMG_4110.JPG not found

I am pretty confident I have a copy of this on my external USB drives.

Also tried another file:

    X1C3:~/media/uploadme$ git-annex whereis IMG_4558.JPG
    git-annex: IMG_4558.JPG not found
    X1C3:~/media/uploadme$ git-annex whereis 2014-10-05/IMG_4558.JPG
    git-annex: 2014-10-05/IMG_4558.JPG not found

So I am still in the dark how to see how git-annex tracks deleted files across my remotes.
