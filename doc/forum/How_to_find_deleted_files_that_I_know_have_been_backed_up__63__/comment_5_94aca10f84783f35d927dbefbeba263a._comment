How do I undelete in my case then? I.e. not `git checkout ` to find where they are.

`git revert c53dbdd9bd7879d68635a2adc81a7bc59a84c5ea`



Assuming I make no effort to undelete or recover the files:

The (deleted) files I have copies of on my other two hard drives. Do they detect I've deleted the files and just clean up? How does that process work?
