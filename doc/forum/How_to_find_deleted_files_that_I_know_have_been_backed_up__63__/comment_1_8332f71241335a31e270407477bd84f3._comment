Is your titular question a git-annex question, or a generic git question?
Because I think the answer would be the same in either case. Ie, `git log`
or `git status` will tell you what changes you've made to the work tree.

If you've deleted files from your git working tree with rm -rf, then
their content is still stored in the .git directory. This is also true
when using git-annex (unless you're using direct mode). 

The size of your .git directory might be a clue: If you've deleted
files from the working tree, you may not have dropped their content
from git annex. You can use `git annex unused` to find and clean up
such file contents.
