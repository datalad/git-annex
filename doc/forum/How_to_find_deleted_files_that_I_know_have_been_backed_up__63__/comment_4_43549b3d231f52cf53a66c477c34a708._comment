Yeah, you need to `git checkout` a tree from before you deleted the files,
and then you'll be able to use `git annex whereis` in there on the deleted
files. This will tell you where the files are currently located (not some historical data).

`git annex whereis --key` is indeed an alternative approach, if you know
the key corresponding to the deleted file. You can see the keys in the git
diff, if you know where to look.

[[internals]] will let you understand how this all really works.
