I think the most likely reason for git commit to be slow on your setup is that it probably rewrites .git/index. If you have a lot of files in your repository, the index file will be large and rewriting the index file will involve re-transferring it all over the network to the SMB share. 

It's also possible that git commit scans the whole work tree, although I don't think it should -- it's not been told to with -a.

You may be able to find what's taking a long time by

    strace git --git-dir=/Volumes/Video/Videos/.git --work-tree=/Volumes/Video/Videos -c core.bare=false commit -m \"git-annex automatic sync\"

(or ltrace)
