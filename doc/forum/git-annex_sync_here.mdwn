Hello,

git-annex does a lot of convenient stuff, also locally. With git-annex sync [remote-name] the synchronization can be restricted to a single remote.

However, I think being able to restrict sync to no remote at all, only doing the local stuff, would be helpful.

The natural syntax for me would be git-annex sync here. But it says:

    $ git-annex sync here
    commit  ok
    git-annex: there is no available git remote named "here"

I think a workaround would be to do:

    $ git-annex sync --no-push --no-pull

Is that correct?

Still, I think "git-annex sync here" would be a convenient shortcut.
