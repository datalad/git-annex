The best way is to make your .gitattributes file configure annex.largefiles
to not match the files or file extensions that you want to not be annexed.
(Including the .gitattributes file itself.)

There are also ways to temporarily override annex.largefiles if you want to
add a single file to git. Although this can be messy to need to remember if
you later modify that file and are adding it again. Configuring
annex.largefiles is better.
