(Another user here.)

I can't take you by the hand but all this seems like regular use of git-annex.

I was overwhelmed at the beginning, followed http://git-annex.branchable.com/walkthrough , visited a number of pages.
I finally had something that worked.

In some cases you might consider, instead of moving files then using git annex add, using https://git-annex.branchable.com/git-annex-import/ with or without some of the options.

If you have specific problems, ask a more specific question.

Happy journey!
