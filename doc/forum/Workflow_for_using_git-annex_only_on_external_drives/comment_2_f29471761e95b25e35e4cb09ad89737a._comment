1) Check out the source repository group, which will drop files once enough numcopies are available elsewhere
2) This is pretty much why git-annex exists :)
3) Set numcopies to 2 and use 'git annex fsck' to find out when there aren't enough copies
4) You can use 'import' or 'reinject --known' to clean up known content outside of git-annex
5) git-annex will run on 'crippled' filesystems like FAT32. Would recommend avoiding this if possible though
6) This is presumed :)

Sorry for brevity, but this should give some direction/keywords.
