Today, I got the strange error below. I unlocked a file, and edited it, and attempted to sync, when I saw the error. 

```

```

It's strange because I've done this unlock, edit, and sync, flow a few times in the past week, with no problems. I've only been able to find one reference point for this, in [git's own documentation](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-fsck#Documentation/git-fsck.txt-codesymlinkPointsToGitDircode). 

It's very concerning because it prevents me from syncing with my remote repository at all. I was able to work around the problem with `git reset HEAD~` so I could at least get a few changes sent to my remote, but that meant I lost all the changes I made to the file itself. 

Can anyone say what the problem might be here? Why does git suddenly seem upset that I've got a symlink pointing at my git directory?
