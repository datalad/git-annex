Hi, I'm using the webapp and created a repository on my local computer. Then I created another remote repository (encrypted remote with gcrypt), this remote repository is selected as type "full backup". 

I've added some files to the local repository, then changed some of them and watched the sync happen. Then I deleted some files, and these also get synced to the remote.

Now, how can I recover those files from the foreign repo, using the webapp or the command line? I could not find any solution.

I tried:
git log --diff-filter=D --summary
and then
git checkout 488408bfcd58eced685d9e3ca5daf55250850f5d -- .
to recover the file listed in this remote but got the following response:
fatal: This operation must be run in a work tree

What do I miss and how does the "Restore" part work when using "full backup" remote repository?
