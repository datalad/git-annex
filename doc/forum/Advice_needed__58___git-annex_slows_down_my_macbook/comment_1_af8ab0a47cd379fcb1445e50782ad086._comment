First - Where are the repos actually located ~/Desktop or ~/annex/<repo>? Other?
 
I can confirm, that like two weeks back I have had similar issue using git-annex-assistant with other synced repos on local LAN and at Box.com. The git-annex processes actually overloaded the CPU and I was forced to kill annex processes to get over.

I also found myself that NFS mounted shares, linked by symlink to home directory, can slowdown mac finder app as well if NFS has slight delays in response.
