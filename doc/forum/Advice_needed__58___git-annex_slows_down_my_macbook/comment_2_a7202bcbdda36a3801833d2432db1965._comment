All repositories are located in my home folders:
~/Pictures
~/Movies
~/Music
~/Documents

On my Ubuntu desktop machine and my macbook. They are connected in my local network via WLAN. 

I use different git annex versions on these two machines. Maybe this causes problems.

On Ubuntu I have 
Version: 4.20130815
Build flags: Assistant Webapp Pairing Testsuite S3 WebDAV Inotify DBus XMPP 

On my macbook:
Version: 5-20140106-gcb3351b
