After installing the binary for Mac OS X and including some larger directories, my computer now seems quite busy (for the last days) with the import process. I see a process called git-annex causing the load, so it seems OK. As the git-annex assistant seems to hang quite a bit, I would like to see the progress using a command line interface. However, I cannot use the "git annex" command as I get the message "git: 'annex' is not a git command. See 'git --help'."

I guess this is my normal git version, installed by homebrew (the OS X version for apt-get) that does not know anything about the installed binary. Can I still use the CLI with this version? Or better, is there or will there be a way to install git-annex from source, or even better using "brew install git-annex"?
