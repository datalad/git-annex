I'm having trouble sharing an rsync remote between two users (as a "transfer" repository).  `git-annex` thinks `rsync` fails because it can't set the permissions on the root directory on the destination.  I've added `--perms --chmod=Dug+rwxs,Fug+rw,o-rwx` to `annex-rsync-options` so all users in the specified group on the destination can create and delete files.  However, I see in the logs errors like:

    sending incremental file list
    ./

      rsync failed -- run git annex again to resume file transfer

The transfer actually completes fine, except for setting permissions of the root directory on the destination (which I don't really care about, because I have manually set them to be correct).  Is it possible for `git-annex` to copy the contents of the directory to rsync remotes?  For the example above, instead of `/blah/.git/annex/tmp/rsynctmp/24863/`, `/blah/.git/annex/tmp/rsynctmp/24863/2fe` would work.  I can't come up with an alternate solution for this server, except using the same remote user (which I'd prefer not to do).
