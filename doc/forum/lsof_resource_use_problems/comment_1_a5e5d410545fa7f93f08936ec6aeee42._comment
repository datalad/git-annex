That seems very wrong.. On my linux system here, I can `lsof /` and it uses 4 kb total, and runs in 0.09 seconds, to report on 3500 open files.

But, I don't know about freebsd. lsof may be more expensive there for some reason, like needing to look in kernel memory rather than in /proc perhaps? But expensive to the tune of gigabytes of space used, that must be lsof misbehaving.
