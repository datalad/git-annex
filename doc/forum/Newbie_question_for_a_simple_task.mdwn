Hi,

I am pretty confident, that this is a newbie question. Nevertheless, I did not find the answer (or the solution) event after looking at the screencasts and reading through the files.

I want to sync 2 clients on different networks though a ssh cloud server begin a full backup.
Also, I would like to do this for 2 different folders on the clients and server.
I mean : client 1, 2 and the server sync a repo named "DATA" and also sync another repo named "IMAGES"

Setting the client1 as local client repo and also ssh remote repo works quite well, it uploads everything to the server. Then I make the same on the second client, and it does not start to download everything from the server...

Any clue ?
