I'm trying to sync from a direct repo to another direct repo but getting a non-fast-forward rejection:

      Pushing to v-crateris failed.

      (non-fast-forward problems can be solved by setting receive.denyNonFastforwards to false in the remote's git config)
    failed

I tried setting `receive.denyNonFastforwards` to `false` as the message said, but it made no difference.
Both repos have `annex/direct/master` checked out.

What should I do to resolve this?
