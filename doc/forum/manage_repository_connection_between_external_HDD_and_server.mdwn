I have one server, two computers, and one external HDD.

The git-annex repo on my server (`nhost`) has the following remotes:

```
qhost	qhost:NIdata (fetch)
qhost	qhost:NIdata (push)
zhost	zhost:NIdata (fetch)
zhost	zhost:NIdata (push)
```

The repo on `zhost` has the following remotes:

```
data0	/run/media/mee/data0/NIdata/ (fetch)
data0	/run/media/mee/data0/NIdata/ (push)
nhost	nhost:NIdata (fetch)
nhost	nhost:NIdata (push)
```

The repo on my HDD (`data0`) has thefollowing remotes:

```
nhost		nhost:NIdata (fetch)
nhost		nhost:NIdata (push)
qhost		/qhost/home/mee/NIdata/ (fetch)
qhost		/qhost/home/mee/NIdata/ (push)
zhost		/zhost/home/mee/NIdata/ (fetch)
zhost		/zhost/home/mee/NIdata/ (push)
```

Any ideas how I can set up a remote from `nhost` to `data0`, without making the identity of data0 dependent on which machine I am using on each particular session?
