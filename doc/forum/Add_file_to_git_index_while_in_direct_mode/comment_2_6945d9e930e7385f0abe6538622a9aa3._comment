Sorry, I should have clarified. I was not sure how to add a commit message.

I played with a test repo and I think I figured it out. What I tried was this:
   
```
$ git init test-repo
$ touch test.txt
$ git add test.txt
$ git commit -m \"initial commit\"
$ git annex init
$ git config annex.largefiles=\"*.pdf\"
$ echo \"updated\" > test.txt
$ git annex add test.txt
$ git annex sync -m \"updated test.txt\"
```

So if I understand correctly, in direct mode 

- ```git add``` ->  ```git annex add``` 
- ```git commit -m MSG``` -> ```git annex sync -m MSG```

```git log``` now shows the right message, but I am still not sure how to check whether a file is in the annex or directly in the git tree. I suppose I could just make aliases for git add and git commit, but I wouldn't be able to add arbitrary files to git annex without playing with annex.largefiles. For example, if I had many small ```.txt``` files and one large file and I wanted to just add that large file to the git annex, I'd have to change the largefiles setting.

Is there a better way of doing this or is loss of functionality intrinsic until Windows symlinks work?
