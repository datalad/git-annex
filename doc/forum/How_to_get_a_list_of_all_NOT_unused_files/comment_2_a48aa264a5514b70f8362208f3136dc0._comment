The reason `git-annex copy --not --unused` behaves that way is that
--unused is not a file matching option. --not, meanwhile, inverts the next
file matching option. So here it does nothing. So that command is the same
as `git-annex copy --unused`!

Obviously, that's a bit of an excuse, but it's what's going on. I do think
that having `--not --unused` work would be a useful thing. Opened a todo
[[todo/support_--not_--unused]].
