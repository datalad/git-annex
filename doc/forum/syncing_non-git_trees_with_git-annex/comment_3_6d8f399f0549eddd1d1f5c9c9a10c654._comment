Here's another handy command-line which annexes all files in repo B which have already been annexed in repo A:

    git status --porcelain | sed -n '/^ T /{s///;p}' | xargs git annex add

The 'T' outputted by git status for these files indicates a type change: it's a symlink to the annex in repo A, but a normal file in repo B.
