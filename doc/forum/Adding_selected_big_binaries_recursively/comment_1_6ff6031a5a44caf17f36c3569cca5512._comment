It's fine to annex the big files and store the small files in git in
the usual way.

The `find | xargs` approach should work.

You can also use the [[git-annex-matching-options]], eg:

	git annex add --include='*.adi'

Or:

	git annex add --largerthan=1mb


You can also configure git-annex to know which files you consider
large, so that `git annex add` will annex the large ones and add 
the rest to git not the annex. See [[tips/largefiles]]
