I created .gitattributes in the root of my repo:
jfisher@buildos1:~/annex$ cat .gitattributes
* annex.largefiles=(largerthan=100mb)
jfisher@buildos1:~/annex$ git config -l
user.email=jfisher@intouchhealth.com
user.name=John Fisher
core.repositoryformatversion=0
core.filemode=true
core.bare=false
core.logallrefupdates=true
annex.uuid=75d91aa9-f5fc-45b8-b62c-e6050ed7c3d5
annex.version=5

where I intend for all users of the repo to automatically add all files larger than 100Mb as annexed and add all other files as conventional git.

I ran 
git annex add
and small text files were staged as links, as well as a large file

Comment? Ideas?
