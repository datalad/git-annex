I've been using git-annex for a month or two to manage my music collection.  It's great to know I can drop files if I need space on the laptop, knowing exactly where I have other copies.  Now I'm writing an emacs mode to help me keep track: https://gitorious.org/emacs-contrib/annex-mode

Locally available files are colored differently, and pressing g runs `git annex get` on the file at point.
