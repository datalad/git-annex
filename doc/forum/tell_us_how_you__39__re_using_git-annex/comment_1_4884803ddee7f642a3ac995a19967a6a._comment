git-annex is just amazing. I just started using it and for once, I have hope to be able to organize my files a little better than now.

Currently, I have a huge homedir. From time to time, I move file away in external hard drives, then forget about them. When I want to look at them back, I just can't because I have forgotten where they are. I have also a ton of files on those drives that I can't access because they are not indexed. With git-annex I have hope to put all of these files on a git repository. I will be able to see them everywhere, and find them when I need to.

I might stop loosing files for once.

I might avoid having multiple copies of the same things over and over again, without knowing so. and regain some more disk space.

For the moment, I'm archiving my photographs. But there is one thing that might not go very well: directory hierarchies where everything is important (file owner, specific permissions, symlinks). I won't just be able to blindly annex all of these files. But for the moment I'll stick at archiving ocuments and it should be amazing.
