Any method that can be used to provide a passphrase to gpg should work. 

For example, gpg-agent can cache the passphrase.

Or, you could use gpg's passphrase-file option to make it read the
passphrase from a file. This could be put in ~/.gnupg/gpg.conf.
Although this configuration is probably no more secure than just removing
the passphrase from the gpg key..
