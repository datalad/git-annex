I recently dealt with a segfault caused by a bug in the haskell gnutls library. It could be that's what you were seeing. It's fixed in gnutls (>= 0.1.4)

Yes, you can run `git annex sync` by hand. It does the same syncing of the git repository that the assistant does. I don't think making the assistant poll is a good idea.
