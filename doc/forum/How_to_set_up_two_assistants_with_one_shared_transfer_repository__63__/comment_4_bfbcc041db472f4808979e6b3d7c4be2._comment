Maybe it is possible to avoid the XMPP account setup and transferring via XMPP, maybe getting notifications through the SSH connection is possible.

I'm thinking about a \"git-annex-shell server\" unix socket to which clients would connect using the SSH connection and get update notifications from other clients.
