I can only give the same anwser I gave in
<https://github.com/conda-forge/staged-recipes/pull/4157>,
that it seems to be using the wrong version of the iconv library, and that
the `LIBRARY_PATH`, `LDFLAGS` etc settings your using seem likely to be
causing the problem.

I mean, you're simply using haskell's stack tool, you've not started to
build git-annex at all at this point. If haskell's stack is really this
broken on OSX, I'd think that a lot of people would have noticed. But if
you can reproduce the problem without any strange environment variables
being set, why not file a bug report at <https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/issues/new>.
