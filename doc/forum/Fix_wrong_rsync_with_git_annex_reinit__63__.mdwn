# Context

* Had two repo A and B. 
* A had a lot of content not yet tracked and thus not available on B.
* Filesystem problem on A: (relatively small) part of big repo content is lost.
* In emergency, used rsync to propagate yet untracked content from failing A to sane B.
* But forgot `ignore .git`, so rsync also partly rsync'ed `.git/annex` .
* Now sane repo B believes it is the source one (same UUID A) as shown by `git annex info --fast`. 

Both A and B show:

    UUID-of-A -- A [here]
    UUID-of-B -- B

# Actions done

Search on Google, see [[https://git-annex.branchable.com/git-annex-reinit/]] .

On B:

    git annex reinit UUID-of-B
    git annex fsck

Now `git annex info -fast` on B shows as expected:

    UUID-of-A -- A
    UUID-of-B -- B [here]


I'm currently doing `git annex copy --from B` to repropagate lost parts of A.

# Question

* Were actions done best thing to do?
* Is there something more to do?
* Something to check?

Thanks.
