###Tried to install git-annex.app

- App hangs up
- Cpu "git" load is 100
- Had to force quite git-annex

###Install thru command line: using Brew

- Installed haskell
- updated cabal
- But when I do:

`
cabal install git-annex --bindir=$HOME/bin
`

**I get this**

    Resolving dependencies...
    Configuring gnuidn-0.2...
    cabal: The program c2hs is required but it could not be found.
    Configuring libxml-sax-0.7.3...
    cabal: The pkg-config package libxml-2.0 is required but it could not be found.
    cabal: Error: some packages failed to install:
    git-annex-3.20121127.1 depends on libxml-sax-0.7.3 which failed to install.
    gnuidn-0.2 failed during the configure step. The exception was:
    ExitFailure 1
    libxml-sax-0.7.3 failed during the configure step. The exception was:
    ExitFailure 1
    network-protocol-xmpp-0.4.4 depends on libxml-sax-0.7.3 which failed to install.

Any help would be greatly appreciated. 

Thanks,
