I would like to use git-annex to synchronize 2 directories in the same manner as unison.

I'm starting with 2 directories. There is an overlap of the same set of files in each directory, but each directory also has additional files as well.

I create a git annex in each directory but when I do a git pull it merges and produces conflicts on those files that are the same.

What is the correct workflow for this type of scenario?
