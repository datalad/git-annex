\"joeyh\" just helped me on irc, because I had this very same problem. I have git-annex repositories in A, and in external hard disks B, C, D, ...

If I remove a file in A, I mean to 1) free space in A (drop) and 2) this to propagate later to the drives.

No matter what \"git annex sync\" you do from A, the hard disks in your armchair will keep references to the file in their checkout, so A will refuse to drop the file contents until you run \"git annex sync\" from *each* of your external hard disks.

What you need (and what I also needed) was to rule the drop/unused from A alone. You have to use \"git annex unused --used-refspec=+master\" from A, and that
will only keep into account the contents referenced by your current A master, ignoring the checkouts of B, C, D, ...

The \"used-refspec\" can even be set up in the git config.
