After reading trough this again, I'd like to rephrase my question.

Is it safe if two independent assistants access the same repository at the same time (assuming locking works)?

But, much more important, a big thanks for creating git-annex! I'm using it successfully to keep my files in sync at home and at work and I think it is a really amazing tool. So thanks for the hard work!
