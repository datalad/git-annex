If your NAS is accessed over SSH, it is not a removably drive, clearly.

Try starting git-annex webapp from a console, you will probably see the ssh password prompt there. Or, install ssh-askpass, or, install a current daily build of git-annex, which will prompt for the ssh password from within the webapp.
