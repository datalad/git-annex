I am running git-annex on Mac OS 10.9 and syncing to a Linux device that was attached to a Synology NAS.  Both were running December versions of git-annex.

While working on an application in IntelliJ my workspace.xml file disappeared.  It went from being a real file to being a symlink to a location that didn't exist.

The symlink looks like this: workspace.xml -> ../../../.git/annex/objects/M2/8W/SHA256E-s68106--90e9cc4f617c9034db1bf462d058b82c59ade0be58de1d3a3e2f8c02606631c2.xml/SHA256E-s68106--90e9cc4f617c9034db1bf462d058b82c59ade0be58de1d3a3e2f8c02606631c2.xml

I tried git-annex fsck and I get this message: ** No known copies exist of XXXXXXX/workspace.xml

"XXXXXXX" is a path I needed to obscure I can see it in the git-annex repo but it is a reference to a symlink that doesn't exist

It was mentioned in another thread ( http://git-annex.branchable.com/forum/git_annex_on_osx_only_creating_symlinks__63____63__/ ) that this could happen if I did a forced drop but I do not use git-annex on the command line.  I'm using the assistant and having it manage all of my files for me.

I tried looking at the log for it and it shows this:

<pre>
timmattison$ /Applications/git-annex.app/Contents/MacOS/git-annex log XXXXXXX/.idea/workspace.xml 
- 2014-01-03 19:49:58 XXXXXXX/.idea/workspace.xml | d6747880-b355-4d41-b4e5-d1ad3afcb4a5 -- timmattison@MacBook-Pro.local:~/Desktop/annex
+ 2014-01-03 17:08:32 XXXXXXX/.idea/workspace.xml | d6747880-b355-4d41-b4e5-d1ad3afcb4a5 -- timmattison@MacBook-Pro.local:~/Desktop/annex
(Recording state in git...)
</pre>

So I can see that the git-annex thinks the file was deleted but what really happened is that IntelliJ just modified it.  workspace.xml files are modified very often when working in IntelliJ.

Is this a known bug that has been fixed in the new version (2013-12-30 or later)?

Thanks,
Tim
