A way to do this pretty cleanly is described here:
<http://git-annex.branchable.com/tips/setup_a_public_repository_on_a_web_site/>

The annex-content hook is not meant to be run when a regular git push
is made to the repository. That would be unnecessarily redundant with
existing git hooks.

I'd expect it to be pretty safe to edit files in such a repository,
but you have to keep in mind that if changes are pushed into it at the same
time as an edit is occuring, you can get into various situations with the
hooks etc.
