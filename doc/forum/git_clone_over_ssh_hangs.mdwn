I am trying to use git-annex to sync a folder with a backup drive over the network.
I have followed the walkthrough and run a git annex init in a TrueNAS jail and now I am trying to use git clone through ssh to link the drive and the jail together.
The problem is that the clone in the backup drive just hangs. It will enumerate the files and count them and then it just seems to do nothing.


Command: git clone ssh://user@ip/mnt/dir ./driveBackup
Output:
Cloning into './repo'...
remote: Enumerating objects: 1543, done.
remote: Counting objects: 100% (1543/1543), done.

...Hangs here nothing obvious happens...

Running it in verbose mode reveals nothing. When you stop the clone it will complain about some sideband packet.

I don't know if it helps, but I have set up passwordless ssh login and I have verified that it works by running ssh user@ip successfully from the backup system.
Can someone help me please?
