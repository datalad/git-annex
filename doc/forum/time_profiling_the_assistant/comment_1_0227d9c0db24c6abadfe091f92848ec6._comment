The assistant is stopped by sending it a TERM signal. Seems that the RTS
does not save profiling on TERM.

Try manually sending it an INT signal instead. The RTS does save profiling
when the program is ctrl-c'd.

I'd probably just run git annex assistant --foreground and then ctrl-c it.

There's also a cabal flag to enable EKG, so you can watch pretty graphs in
a web browser while it's running.
