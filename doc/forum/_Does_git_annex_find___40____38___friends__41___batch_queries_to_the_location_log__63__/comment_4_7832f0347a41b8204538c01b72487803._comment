Ok, thanks.

I understand that annex is more sophisticated than what I'm proposing. I'm also
not comparing apples to oranges, what I'm saying is this: All the
logic and checking and git calls that I thought annex needs to do, take
much much less time than those 55 seconds. So either I'm missing something big (about 98% of it in execution time), or
annex is doing something very inefficient. That's all I'm saying, and I was
hoping that you could clarify that, since you already know the code.

Also I'm sorry for being so annoying. If annex were writen in C, I would either have understood those 55 seconds or sent you a patch making annex faster. Being in
haskell means that it will take me considerably more time and effort. But if I manage to
improve things and if it is ok with you I'll send you patches... eventually.
