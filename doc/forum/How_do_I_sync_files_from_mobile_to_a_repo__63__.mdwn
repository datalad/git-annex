I have a local repo on a computer with some folder on the path
/computer1/annex/

Then I tried to run git annex on my phone and added a remote ssh repo syncing to
/computer1/annex/mobile/ from my mobile's picture folder.

But the files ending up there are:
ls /computer1/annex/mobile/
annex  branches  config  description  HEAD  hooks  info  objects  refs 

I chose "full backup"

Why dont I see my pictures there, even if they are hiding in the metadata ?
