This particular feature is unfortunately currently broken on Windows.

I have developed a fix, but am waiting on it getting into a library I use.
See [[bugs/windows_ssh_webapp_password_entry_broken]].

As a workaround, if you can manually set up a passwordless ssh key on
Windows, and configure the remote server to let you log in using that key,
the webapp can then be used to add a repository on the server.
