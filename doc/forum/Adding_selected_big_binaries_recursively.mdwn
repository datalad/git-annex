I have a very large stack of files, with many large binaries.
Unless I am told its a bad idea, I want to initialize a git annex archive with the big files 'git annex added' ( symlinked to hidden annex) and the rest of the files 'git added'

I tried-
git annex add "*.adi"
find . -name "*.adi" | git annex add
find . -name "*.adi" | xargs git annex add
git annex add robots/\*.adi


Whats a good ( correct) way to do only the *.adi files recursively?
( its Friday PST here- will return Monday)
