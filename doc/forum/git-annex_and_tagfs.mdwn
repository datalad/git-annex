Hi,

Thanks for git-annex, really a great project.
Another related feature which would be useful to have is described by tagfs [3][] [4][], experimental implementations such as [tagfs over fuse][1], and [tagsistant][2] exist, but having a solution within the power of git-annex would really be attractive.

How hard would this be to implement within the existing infrastructure?
Thanks.
