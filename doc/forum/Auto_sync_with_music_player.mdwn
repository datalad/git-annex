I have a music directory under Nexus 5 which is a git-annex repository. If I sync the same with remote repository, newly added songs or modified songs(modifed id3 tags) will not sync with music player. But if I use Android File Transfer to transfer songs, it will sync music player. The songs which are transferred using git-annex will reflect in music player only after restart. Do we have to execute any command which will sync music player.
