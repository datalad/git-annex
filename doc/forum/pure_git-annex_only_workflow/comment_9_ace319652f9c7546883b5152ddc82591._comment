Another option that would please the naive user without hindering the more advanced user: \"git annex init\", by default, creates a synced/master branch. \"git annex sync\" will pull from every <remote>/sync/master branch it finds, and also push to any <remote>/sync/master branch it finds, but will not create any. So by default (at least for new users), this provides simple one-step syncing.

Advanced users can disable this per-repo by just deleting the synced/master branch. Presumably the logic will be: Every repo that should not be pushed to, because it has access to some central repo, should not have a synced/master branch. Every other repo, including the (or one of the few) central repos, will have the branch.

This is not the most expressive solution, as it does not allow configuring syncing between arbitrary pairs of repos, but it feels like a good compromise between that and simplicity and transparency.

I think it's about time that I provide less talk and more code. Iâ€™ll see when I find the time :-)
