After some experimentation, this seems to work better:

    	git commit -a -m 'git annex sync'
	git merge git-annex-master
	for remote in $(git remote)
	do
		git fetch $remote
		git merge $remote git-annex-master
	done
	git branch -f git-annex-master
	git annex merge
	for remote in $(git remote)
	do
		git push $remote git-annex git-annex-master
	done

Maybe this approach can be enhance to skip stuff gracefully if there is no git-annex-master branch and then be added to what \"git annex sync\" does, this way those who want to use the feature can do so by running \"git branch git-annex-master\" once. Or, if you like this and want to make it default, just make git-annex-init create the git-annex-master branch :-)
