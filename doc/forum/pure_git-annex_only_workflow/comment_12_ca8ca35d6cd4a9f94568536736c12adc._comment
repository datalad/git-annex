I have made a new `autosync` branch, where all that the user needs to do is run `git annex sync` and it automatically sets up the synced/master branch. I find this very easy to use, what do you think?

Note that `autosync` is also pretty smart about not running commands like \"git merge\" and \"git push\" when they would not do anything. So you may find `git annex sync` not showing all the steps you'd expect. The only step a sync always performs now is pulling from the remotes.
