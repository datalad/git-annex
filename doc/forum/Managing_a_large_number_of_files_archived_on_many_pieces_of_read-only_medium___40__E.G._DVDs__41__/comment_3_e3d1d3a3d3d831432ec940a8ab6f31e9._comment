I have already stored a lot of large files on DVDs. I did that for arhiving, so I cared that there are several copies. But I want this to be more automated.

I take my disc (or one created by someone else, without any knowledge of Git), checksum its contents in git-annex, and in the projects where I'm using this content, I can check that the file is archived on at least N discs.

Also, I might enhance the content -- this would be refected in a Git commit, so then I want also to be able to check that the new version has also ben archived on severeal discs.

A special remote for such free-form read-only media would be very convenient.
