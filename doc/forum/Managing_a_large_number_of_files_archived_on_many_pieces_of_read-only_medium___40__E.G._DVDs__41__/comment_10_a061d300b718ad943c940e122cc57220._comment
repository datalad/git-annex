Thanks for the suggestion Joey, I found a way to make the web remotes work for adding the files from existing discs.  I wound up adding a symlink farm to the repo with a link for each disk pointing at the mount point.  This way when I try to retrieve a file, I see the URL which contains the name of the disc:

    $ git annex get bigfile.bin
    get bigfile.bin (from web...) 
    curl: (37) Couldn't open file /var/tmp/repo/storage/dvd13/bigfile.bin
    
      Unable to access these remotes: web
    
      Try making some of these repositories available:
            00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001 -- web
    failed
    git-annex: get: 1 failed

It took me a while as the version of git-annex in portage was rather old and I just didn't get around to updating git-annex on Gentoo for while.  If anybody wants to get git-annex 3.20121112 running under Gentoo I detailed the process I used at <http://git-annex.mysteryvortex.com>

Now I'll have to try out the assistant!  (Though I didn't get the webapp to compile due to a shakespeare-js error)
