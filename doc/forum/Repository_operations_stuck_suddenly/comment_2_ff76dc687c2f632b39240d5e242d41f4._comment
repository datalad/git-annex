If it gets fully stuck and the number is not increasing at all, I'd second
the suggestion to gdb, or run git with `GIT_TRACE=1 GIT_TRACE_PACKET=1`

If it's increasingly but slowly, it might be that you have an older version
of git-annex, or a repository using git-annex format v8. That makes git
have to run git-annex once per file it needs to update the status of.
(Why git needs to update the status of so many files I don't know, but
there are certianly situations where it could.)
Upgrading to git-annex v10 lets git run git-annex only once, so will be a
lot faster.
