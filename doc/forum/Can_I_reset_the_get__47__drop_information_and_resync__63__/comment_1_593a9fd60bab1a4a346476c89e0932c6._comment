If I understand you correctly you mean that you somehow got git-annex' location tracking out-of-sync with the reality of where files are? I.e. `git annex list` shows some files as present in a repository which aren't actually there?

If yes then `git annex fsck` (<https://git-annex.branchable.com/git-annex-fsck/>) should find and correct these issues (or tell you if they are not fixable).
