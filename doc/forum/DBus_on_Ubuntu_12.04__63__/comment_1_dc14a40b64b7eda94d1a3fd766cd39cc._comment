Hmm, let's see... 
 
If the gibberish error is ouyay orgotfay otay otay elltay emay utwhay ethay
roreay asway, then we can figure it out, surely..

If the gibberish error looks something like Ḩ̶̞̗̓ͯ̅͒ͪͫe̢ͦ̊ͭͭͤͣ̂͏̢̳̦͔̬ͅ ̣̘̹̄̕͢Ç̛͈͔̹̮̗͈͓̞ͨ͂͑ͅo̿ͥͮ̿͢͏̧̹̗̪͇̫m̷̢̞̙͑̊̔ͧ̍ͩ̇̚ę̜͑̀͝s̖̱̝̩̞̻͐͂̐́̂̇̆͂ 

.. your use of cabal  
has accidentually summoned Cthulu! Back slowly away from the monitor!

Otherwise, you might try installing the `libdbus-1-dev` package with apt, 
which might make cabal install the haskell dbus bindings successfully. Or
you could just install the `libghc-dbus-dev` package, which contains the 
necessary haskell library pre-built. But I don't know if it's in Ubuntu 
12.04; it only seems to be available in quantal 
<http://packages.ubuntu.com/search?keywords=libghc-dbus-dev>

Or you could even build it with the Makefile, rather than using cabal.
The Makefile has a `-DWITH_DBUS` setting in it that can be removed to build
the fallback mode that doesn't use dbus.
