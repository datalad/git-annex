I have a corrupted repository, that git annex assistant wanted to repair. Before clicing on the button to start the repairing process, I had to deactivate my internet connection for another reason. The daemon.log is showing some connection errors to my remotes. But since pressing the button to repair my repo, the webapp is not showing the dashboard and there's no indicator that's trustworthy enough, that stuff is happening. There are some git and git annex processes running, but is there really now better way to know, if the repairing process is making progress, or if I need to restart the assistant because I needed to reset my internet connection.
