If you also have the files present locally, you can simply do `git annex copy --fast --to remote`. git-annex copy will first check to see if the remote has the file; seeing that it does it will update the location log.

Another option, if you have shell access on the remote is to simply set up a git repository there, move the files into it and `git annex add` them, and merge that into your local repository.

There is not currently any way to set the [[location_tracking]] information to tell git-annex that a file has appeared on a remote. Of course, you can modify the git-annex branch manually to do so. See [[internals]].
