Hi,

Our need is to create a JAVA application under Windows that manages programmatically the synchronisation of a local directory structure from a remote directory on a Linux machine:
- locally the user may choose the content of the remote directory to synchronise
- then the application is able to synchronize ths content on demand or on a regular basis

Can git-annex + git a soluton that answer those requirements ?
Does git-annex expose an API callable from JAVA ?

Thank you in advance,
Regards
