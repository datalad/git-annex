You can sync both repos. The simplest way is to have both clients signed on to jabber. This way the clients exchange information when the two are online.

Additionally you need to have a cloud special remote available on both ends. The cloud repository is needed to push and retrieve data for the clients. You need to configure the cloud as a transfer reposity. The clients as - what else - client. The USB Drive can be used as a backup repository on one or both ends and perhaps even for syncing very large files around.
