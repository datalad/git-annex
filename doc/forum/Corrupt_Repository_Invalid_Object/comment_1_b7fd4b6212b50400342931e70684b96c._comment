git is complaining about one of the files in `.git/objects` being missing or corrupt.

It's not likely that some accidental command you ran caused this. More likely a disk error or an unclean shutdown could have left the repository in this state.

You can try running `git annex repair` which should be able to repair git repositories with this kind of damage.

Or you can just `git clone` the repository from any other place you have it and move over .git/annex/objects and .git/config to the new repository, discarding the damaged one.
