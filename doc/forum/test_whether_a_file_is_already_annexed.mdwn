I am storing the pictures I took over the years with git-annex. Frequently I come across messy old directories with lots of pictures inside and I want to know which ones were already annexed - or which ones were not. Is there a quick way to test whether the content of a given file is already annexed? I mean computing the key (hash) of the given file and testing whether it is already present among the annex objects.
