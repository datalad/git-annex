The "variant" names are based on a short hash of the key
of the file, so there's no way to get from such a name back to the
repository that the file was added to.

What you can do is, look at the `git log --stat`, and find
the two conflicting commits, and use git to either revert back to one of
the two, or reset back to before the automatic merge and manually
merge the two. 

(Of course, this all works best when the repository is
in indirect mode and you can use any git commands you like to slice and
dice it. When the repo is direct mode, you might be able to run those
same git commands via `git annex proxy`)
