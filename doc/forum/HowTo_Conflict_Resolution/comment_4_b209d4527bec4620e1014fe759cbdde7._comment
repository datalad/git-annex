git's default handling of merge conflict resolution is to require you to
manually decide which of the two versions of the file to use. So, if you
just don't use git-annex sync, and instead use git pull, it seems to me
you'll get what you want.

(You could also use `git annex sync --no-pull --content` to let everything
except for the pull and merge be done by that command, and run the git pull 
manually first.)
