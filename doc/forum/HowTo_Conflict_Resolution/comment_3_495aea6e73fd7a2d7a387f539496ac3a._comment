A very belayed reply...

I would really love to see a feature to make this easier! Like

* Interactive merge: During merge the user is asked for each file that conflicts, if it wants to keep the local or the remote
* A set merge tool: A tool that allows to either select the local or remote file, renames it accordingly and commits it.

Currently, I really fear a merge conflict, because I work with sets of binary files that needs to be in a coherent state and a merge conflict gives me very much trouble restoring that state.

Thanks!
