OK that sounds reasonable. I'll give it a go.

I don't mind so much that the remote is not human readable as I wont be browsing directly on the remote, but what I did find disconcerting is that I didn't seem to be able to access any files. For example if I lose both the client machines, how do I get access to the files on the remote?
