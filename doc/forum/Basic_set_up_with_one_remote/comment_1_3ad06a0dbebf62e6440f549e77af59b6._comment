Hi,

When setting up a ssh remote the default is to create a repo without a human readable file structure. To achieve what you are looking for you have to initialize a git annex repo on the server and then add the remote to the clients. afaik this has to be done using the command line interface. 

If i remember correctly you add remotes with `git remote add ssh://example.com/path/to/annex`

Cant find the docs atm (I'm commuting and at my final dest)
