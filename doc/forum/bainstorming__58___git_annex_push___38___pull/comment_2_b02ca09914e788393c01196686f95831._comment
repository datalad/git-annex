No-so-subtle sarcasm taken and acknowledged :)

Arguably, git-annex should know about any local limits and not have them implemented via mr from the outside. I guess my concern boils down to having git-annex do the right thing all by itself with minimal user interaction. And while I really do appreciate the flexibility of chaining commands, I am a firm believer in exposing the common use cases as easily as possible.

And yes, I am fully aware that not all annexes are created equal. Point in case, I would never use git annex pull on my laptop, but I would git annex push extensively.
