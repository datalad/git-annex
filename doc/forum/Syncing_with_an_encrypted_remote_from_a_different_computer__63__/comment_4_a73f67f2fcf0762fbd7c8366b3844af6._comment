Other good options to supplement an offline backup drive:

* A clone of the repository on another computer of yours, or on an Adroid tablet or phone.
* An encrypted git repository stored on a remote ssh server. (Supported by recent git-annex releases, although the assistant does not yet have a UI to set this up it's not very hard to do it manually at the command line and then the assistant will use it.)
