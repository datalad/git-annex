Here is the group and wanted output on my laptop (that is dropping all the files):

    ~/Documents/personal-annex $ git annex group .
    unwanted
    ~/Documents/personal-annex $ git annex wanted .
    standard

Here is the output on my desktop (that seems to be keeping all the files):

    ~/Documents/annex-personal $ git annex group .
    
    ~/Documents/annex-personal $ git annex wanted .
    



Reading the manpage suggests I might want to change this. However I haven't seen in the man page a list of the standard predefined groups, nor an explanation of how each predefined group behaves. Is that documented somewhere else?
