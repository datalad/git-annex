Hey,

I was wondering if it is currently possible to let the assistant (or git-annex in general) preserve extended attributes. I didn't find any options hinting at this, although it should be possible at least in theory by using the metadata system of git-annex...

Considering that some applications use extended attributes to store custom meta data (like tags etc.), I think it would be valuable to have such an option...
