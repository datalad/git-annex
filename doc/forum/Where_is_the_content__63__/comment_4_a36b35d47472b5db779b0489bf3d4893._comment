That warning about text relocations always happens on Android and is not relevant to whatever problem you're having.

If git-annex status does not print anything else, then it seems you have a git-annex repository in /sdcard/annex. If you entered \"mediashare\" in the webapp, you might have another repository in another location. When you open the webapp, it tells you the location of the repository in the upper-right corner -- \"Repository: $location\"
