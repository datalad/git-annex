I'm afraid I've ruined the remote repo. For directory, I wrote \"mediashare\" because that's where I want copy to go.  i don't want it in default \"annex\". In git assistant, it is unclearbwhst directory means.   Mount point for cooy of remote? 

Well, this is all I get now...

1|u0_a127@manta:/sdcard $ cd annex
u0_a127@manta:/sdcard/annex $ git annex status
WARNING: linker: git-annex has text relocations. This is wasting memory and is a security risk. Please fix.
