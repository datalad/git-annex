Thanks so much. I'll try digging some more into the syscalls and see what I can figure out. We do have it set up as a directory remote.

To clarify, when I said it was \"hanging\" maybe that wasn't a good word choice. What I meant was that it very quickly gets to 95% or 100% progress, then freezes and does nothing for a while, before ultimately reporting the error and exiting.

Also I take back what I said about it not using encryption. It is. I was confused by the fact that there are unencrypted files on the disk, but it turns out they are all from a long time ago, perhaps before we started using encryption. Everything more recent is encrypted.

Thanks!
