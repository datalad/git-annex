Yeah, it's close returning the error. As far as I can tell the calls involving that file are:

    open(path, O_WRONLY|O_CREAT|O_NOCTTY|O_NONBLOCK, 0666) = fh
    fstat(fh, {st_mode=S_IFREG|0755, st_size=sz, ...}) = 0
    ftruncate(fh, 0) = 0
    ioctl(fh, SNDCTL_TMR_TIMEBASE or SNDRV_TIMER_IOCTL_NEXT_DEVICE or TCGETS, ptr) = -1 ENOTTY (Inappropriate ioctl for device)
    write(fh, data, len) x 60
    close(fh) = -1 EHOSTDOWN (Host is down)

All the calls to write appear to succeed, followed by the call to close that fails. Maybe the previously failed ioctl command has something to do with it? I guess as was mentioned previously, there may be an operation the device doesn't support, but the weird thing is this used to work fine.
