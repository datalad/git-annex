Sorry about the delay getting back to this.. It's great you were able
to provide the strace.

I don't think that the ioctl is at fault. That seems to be something
that's done by the IO layer when opening a handle. It does not involve
locking.

Looks to me like the writes get buffered and it fails to flush to the SMB
server on close.
