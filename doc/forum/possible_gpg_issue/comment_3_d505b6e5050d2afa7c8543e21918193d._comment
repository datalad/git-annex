The relevant error message seems to be this:

	hClose: does not exist (Host is down)

Which doesn't point at gpg being the problem to me. git-annex is trying to
close a file after writing it, and that's failing with EHOSTDOWN. Not a usual
error code, but then you're using a network filesystem, which has many unusual
failure modes.

The next step would probably be to strace git-annex to see what syscall
is failing. Looks like it might be close(2), but then again hClose might be
doing something else first.

It's possible that this has something to do with the SMB share not supporting
some POSIX filesystem feature that git-annex uses. Lack of support for fcntl
locking is a problem with NFS, dunno about SMB.

What would probably work better would be to set up a
[[directory special remote|special_remotes/directory]] on the SMB share.
That requires a lot less from the filesystem than a full-fledged git remote
does.

(Two parts of what you said don't make sense to me BTS. I see no evidence of it hanging in the transcript, so am unclear why
you said it was hanging, as opposed to gracefully failing. And, you said the SMB remote was not configured to use encryption, but it's clearly
encrypted in the transcript.)
