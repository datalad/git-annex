Enormous animated gif shows:

1. List of remotes. "Kapsel" remote has "Syncing disabled"
2. Apparently user clicks on that, although it's not entirely clear.
   Page seems to reload and still has "Syncing disabled" for Kapsel.
3. User goed to Edit repository for Kapsel. That page has "Syncing enabled"
   checked.
4. User saves and remote list still has it disabled.

I guess my suggestion is, first to tell us what version of git-annex you're
using, and second, take a look at .git/annex/daemon.log inside the git
repository. There's probaby something to help narrow the problem down in
the log.

It would probably also help to paste the .git/config stanza for
the remote.
