Hi all,

git-annex basically renders my repository unmanageble.  What is the
best and save (!) way to recover?

Here is my situation:

I have a fairly large repository with ~8000 managed files taking about
65GB of disk space.

git-annex worked well there.  But some programs choke on the
symlinks.  So, I converted the repository to direct mode.  The
transition worked well.

Now git status reports a type change for the ~8000 files.

But as soon as I run

    git commit -m "typechange" even-only-one-of-the-files

the process `git-annex pre-commit .` eats 3.5GB of ram, where I
usually kill it, as I only have 4GB of ram....
