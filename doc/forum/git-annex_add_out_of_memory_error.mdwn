Greetings all!

I have only been using git-annex for a few days, but I am loving it so far.

I have run into one problem:

At the top of a directory tree with some very large (GB+) blobs, I issue this command:

find . -size +5M  -exec git-annex add --debug {} \;  2>&1 | tee -a ./annex-add.log

When the command completes, I see a number of these types of errors in the log:

I've googled around and searched the forums/bug reports here without much success.
I have tried setting the queuesize to smaller values, but that does not seem to help.

I am using git-annex version: 5.20150930-g40fdbe9 on RHEL 6.

I am happy to help debug further...

Thanks,

JC

P.S. - Is it normal that some links in the .git dir are created without user write access?
