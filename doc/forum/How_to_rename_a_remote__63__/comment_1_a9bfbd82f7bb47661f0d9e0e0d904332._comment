You can rename a git remote with just \"git remote rename <old> <new>\". However, for a special remote, git-remote will fail to rename it unless you first add a dummy remote.<name>.fetch value in .git/config. You can remove it later.

So, for example:

<pre>
git config remote.$uglyname.fetch dummy
git remote rename $uglyname $nicename
git config remote.$nicename.fetch \"\"
</pre>

(The webapp handles doing this when you edit a remote's name, BTW.)

---

There's actually another place the name of a special remote is recorded, in `remote.log`. That name is only used when you use `git annex initremote` though. It actually is possible to change it, by using `initremote` to change the vale of the name field. Example:

<pre>
git annex initremote $uglyname name=$newname
</pre>

Note that for some types of special remotes, this will require you to re-specify some other configuration. For example, with a directory special remote, it wanted me to include a directory= parameter.
