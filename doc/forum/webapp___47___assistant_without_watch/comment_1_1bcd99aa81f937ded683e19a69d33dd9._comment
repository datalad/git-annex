The assistant is currently only able to transfer files that it has added itself. So if you disable syncing, you have to manually upload any files you add.

I doubt that I will change this in the assistant, because supporting this use case would complicate it unnecessarily for a use case that is not what it's designed to do. It's more likely that `git annex sync` will get an option to also transfer file contents.
