git annex status doesn't checksum files, so it can't be the sha executables
in PATH.

Instead, git-annex status, when in a direct mode repository like on
windows, checks the recorded timestamps etc of the files to determine if
they're modified.

I suppose one possibility is a time zone change or DST change. Did you
recently "fall back" from DST in your location?

Due to the braindead way Windows deals with timezone changes, 
the timestamps of files appear to *change* when the timezone has changed.
git-annex tries to detect this situation and offset to get back a stable
timestamp that can be used to detect file modifications, but I can't say
that I've tested this situation very carefully, beyond the one very painful
day implementing that workaround.

Anyway, running `git annex sync` may result in it noticing that nothing has
actually changed and get the status display to work better.
