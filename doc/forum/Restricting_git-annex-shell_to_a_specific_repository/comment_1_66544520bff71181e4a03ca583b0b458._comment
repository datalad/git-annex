I've added a `GIT_ANNEX_SHELL_DIRECTORY` environment variable, that, if set, prevents git-annex-shell from operating on any other directory.

I've made the assistant include that setting in `authorized_keys` that it sets up. For example:

    command=\"GIT_ANNEX_SHELL_DIRECTORY=/home/me/annex ~/.ssh/git-annex-shell\" ...
