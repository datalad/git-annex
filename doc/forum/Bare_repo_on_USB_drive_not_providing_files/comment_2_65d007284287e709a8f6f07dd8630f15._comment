I fnally made it work. I tried git-annex sync wihtout luck. What tricked me was the size of the bare repo, it made me thought that it had the files. However after I've made a git annex get on the bare repo it got all the files and after that everthing worked as expected.
So, if I don't get you wrong, it is safer to use a bare repo on the USB drive?
Thanks for the help.
Best regards,
                     Juan
