You should be able to use a direct mode repo on a USB drive.
Of course, if you delete files from there, the deletion will propigate
to other clones of that repo. It could be that there's some bug
with direct mode repos that causes file deletions to be incorrectly
committed; if so you could a) revert the bad commits and b) file a bug
report with details to reproduce the problem.

As to a bare repo on a USB drive, it will work too. It sounds to me like
you forgot to run `git annex sync` after copying the files to that repo.
And/or forgot to run `git annex sync` before asking git-annex to get
the files from the drive.

That is to say, the fulll process would be:

Plug drive into first computer, and run in that computer's repo:

	git annex copy --to usbdrive
	git annex sync

And then move drive to other computer, and run in that computer's
repo:
	
	git annex sync
	git annex copy --from usbdrive
