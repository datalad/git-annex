I had never heard of [exFAT](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ExFAT) before.

I guess you were mounting it in linux using the FUSE implementation of
exFAT. It's not very surprising when FUSE filesystems leave off support
for some syscalls. In this case, chmod.

Since even git clone fails, git-annex obviously cannot work.

A bare repository might be the only option if you're stuck using exFAT for
some reason.
