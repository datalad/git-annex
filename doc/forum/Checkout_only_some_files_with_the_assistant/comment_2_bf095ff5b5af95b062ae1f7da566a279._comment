Thanks for your reply.

The Standard group \"manual\" seems to be what i need. The last thing i'd like to now is, is there a way to do git annex get on the assistant(on the webui) on my phone? (I know i can do this on the shell opened, but it's not that easy to write from the phone.) I guess it's not implemented, and i understand that it should be a lot of work to add a file browser in the ui where you can git annex get, and git annex add from it.

Thanks again for your answer, really helpfull: I have a better idea on how i will structur my git annex repositories.
