git-annex doesn't currently have a way to generate those lists itself, but you could use `git annex metadata --json` to get the metadata of all files, and pipe that json into a parser to get the data you want.

The output could also be parsed in non-json mode. For example, this will list the tags:

    git annex metadata  | grep '^  tag=' | cut -d '=' -f 2 | sort | uniq

Although it's possible for metadata to contain newlines, and so parsing the json is a more reliable approach.

Another nice way to see all the tags is to switch to a view of all tags:

    git annex view 'tag=*'
    ls
"""]]
