This may have been an unrelated issue -- I just realized that I somehow ended up with a bunch of files in the annex under the directory \"misc\" and others under the directory \"Misc\" -- I'm not sure how they got that way, since I'm on OS X and those are supposed to be the same directory -- but they get synced over to a linux box where they're different directories.  This may be the source of some of the weirdness I saw; I'm not sure.  I tried to fix it all up on the linux box so everything was in its own directory.
