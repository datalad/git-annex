It's not supposed to fail when the bucket already exists. There is an
explicit check to see whether the bucket exists in current versions.

Unfortunately, git-annex can't support the Frankfurt datacenter,
until this API problem gets fixed <https://github.com/aristidb/aws/pull/199>

In my tests, it doesn't fail that way when the bucket already exists.
I didn't create the bucket in Frankfurt though, and it could be
that due to the API problem it fails to notice that the bucket in Frankfurt
already exists.
