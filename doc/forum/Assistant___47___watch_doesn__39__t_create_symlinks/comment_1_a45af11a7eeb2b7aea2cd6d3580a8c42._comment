Found that 

git annex lock .


fix it 


I guess when copied it kept in unlocked state which may be nothing but absence of symlink (layman term)
So by this logic when I tried 
git annex lock .
it fixed this problem.

Not sure if here are any option/config to control this that
when file first copies it should be directly put into locked state.


Thanks
