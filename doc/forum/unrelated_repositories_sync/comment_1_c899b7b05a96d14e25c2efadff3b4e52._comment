It might help if you think about these two different repositories as branches. You have 2 branches with different files in them, and you want to produce a third branch with some mix of the two.

I think git is perfectly capable of doing that. Where it gets hairy is dealing with merges when either of the 2 repositories change going forward. The same as if you've forked and modified source code, you will need to do *something* to resolve merges.
