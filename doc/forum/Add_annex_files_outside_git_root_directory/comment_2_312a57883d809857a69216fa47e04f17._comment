Ok, seems that I assumed incorrectly that `.gitignore` files were not valid for annex.

However, if I `git add file_that_is_ignored`, I get an error message saying:

    The following paths are ignored by one of your .gitignore files:
    Use -f if you really want to add them.

Would it be possible for git-annex to be consistent with git behaviour here?
