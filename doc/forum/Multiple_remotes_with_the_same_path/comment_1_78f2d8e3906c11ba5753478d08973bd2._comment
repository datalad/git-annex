git-annex is not getting confused; it's looking at the current content of
the remote and using that uuid. Failing to do so would constitute
confusion.

If you want the remote to only work when the drive is plugged into a single
host, you need to make the remote path only reach a repository on that
host. One way would be a symlink, eg `/home/grawity/Attic/rain-Software ->
Software` on rain.

Or, just use the repository description, eg
`--in grawity@rain:~/Attic/Software`. Note that the description can be
changed to something easier to type.
