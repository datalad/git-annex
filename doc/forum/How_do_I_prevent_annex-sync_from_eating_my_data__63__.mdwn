How do I prevent annex-sync from eating my data by automatic commits?

I have already set the following:

$ anx config --get annex.autocommit

false

$ anx config --get annex.resolvemerge

false

$ anx config --get annex.synccontent

false

$ anx config --get annex.synconlyannex

true

Workflow is as follows:

- single repo on a PC with mixed locked and unlocked files and an adb special remote.

- make a change to a file on the android device;

- run git annex sync;

Current behavior:

Said file (sometimes; I don't get the logic) gets overwritten on the PC.

All unlocked files are automatically locked.

Oh and if git-annex noticed a conflict and refused to overwrite the file on the android device during export,
then if I run git annex sync again it overwrites the file on the android device anyway leading to data loss.

What the hell?

Desired behavior:

Apply some conflict resolution strategies if needed and just stage the changes.

Don't actually commit any changes.

Don't eat my data by automatically running git annex export.
