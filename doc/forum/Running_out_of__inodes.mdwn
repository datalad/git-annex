When syncing with a huge git annex repository on usb disk, my small laptop partition runs out of inodes.

Any workaround for this?

- Use bare repository?

    Some git annex command are not supported.
    This makes managing (particularly adding) files difficult.

- Use a loop file partition with tiny block size and large inode numbers?

    Operations on a huge git repository are slow.
    On a loop file partition will be slower.

- Maybe shrink the partition and make room for a specific partition for git annex repository?

Any opinions?
