The assistant can handle this syncing via a central bare remote. The only problem is that, since your server does not have git-annex installed, that remote will have annex-ignore set on it. That made the assistant not use it for syncing at all.

I've just committed a change to git that makes the assistant still use such a git remote for syncing the git repository, even though it cannot store file contents there.
