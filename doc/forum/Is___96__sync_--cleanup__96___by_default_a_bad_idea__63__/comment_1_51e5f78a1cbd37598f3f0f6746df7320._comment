`git-annex sync --cleanup` does not do any of the pushing and pulling that
`git-annex sync` does without the option. So you would want to run the
command once without the option, and then once with it.

Besides being extra work, `git-annex sync --cleanup` can delete sync
branches that have not yet been merged. That's the point of it after all;
the docs for it discuss a situation where you would want it to do that. But
usually you do want to let the sync branches be merged.

My recommendation would be to not use the option unless you actually need
it.
