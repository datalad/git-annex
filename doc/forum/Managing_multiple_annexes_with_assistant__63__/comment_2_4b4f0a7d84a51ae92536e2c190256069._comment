I was trying to add a second annex (repository) via the webapp, but it seems like the process never completes: the browser just spins (\"connecting...\"). If I kill the webapp process and restart, I can see the second annex in the list of repositories, but clicking on it gives the same behaviour. Interestingly, the path *is* added to ~/.config/git-annex/autostart, and the webapp does create the path, if needed, and initializes it as a git annex. I've reproduced this on two different machines, both running Ubuntu 12.10 and git annex 3.20121112.

Is there anything I can do to help debug?
