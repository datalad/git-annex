That sounds like this bug:
<http://git-annex.branchable.com/bugs/__34__git-annex__58___direct__58___1_failed__34___on_Windows/>

Windows has some path length issues that come up especially when using
git-annex in a deeply nested directory tree. Try cloning the repository to
somewhere like c:\\ and see if that works around the problem.

Although, the path it's complaining about is relative and only 113
characters long, which should not be long enough to trigger that problem.
So, this could be some other problem. I tried cloning a git-annex repo
and git annex init did not fail like this, so any information you can
provide to help me reproduce the problem would be good.
