[I described the ikiwiki album setup](http://ikiwiki.info/forum/ikiwiki_with_album___38___underlay_plugins/) on the ikiwiki website as there are no git-annex tricks anymore. Just standard behaviour.

Yes they are completely separate repos. Really the underlay dir could be managed in any way you like svn, rsync, ftp etc. I didn't expect the album plugin to pick everything up but apparently it does! Perhaps underlays are completely integrated and appear as 'normal' to all of ikiwiki?
