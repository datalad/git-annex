Interesting experiment.

I don't know why you don't want to let git-annex sync its data to $gitdir.

The symlinks could be occuring because of a bug in direct mode. (I have fixed many past bugs that caused that.) But just as likely it's because ikiwiki will run `git pull` in the srcdir.

I think it would make more sense to use the underlay plugin and keep your annexed repository in a separate underlay. This would guarantee ikiwiki doesn't run git commands in there, and would ensure that nothing done with the web interface could mess with the annex.
