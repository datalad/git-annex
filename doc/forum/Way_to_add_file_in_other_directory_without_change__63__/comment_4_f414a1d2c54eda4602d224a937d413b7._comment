This is a job for a directory special remote with importtree=yes

	git-annex initremote nas type=directory directory=/mnt/nas encryption=none importtree=yes
	git-annex import master --from nas --no-content
	git merge --allow-unrelated-histories nas/master

As shown this will merge all files in /mnt/nas into your master branch,
without downloading the content. You can `git-annex get` files from there
later. It's also possible to import the files into a subdirectory, see
[[git-annex-import]]. 

If you want to only add a single file, you can replace the 
`git merge` with something else, or configure the preferred content
expression of the remote to only match that file.
