Okay I got git annex addurl file:/// working with this config.

```
[annex \"security\"]
	allowed-url-schemes = http https file
	allowed-http-addresses = all
```

But it copies the file to local directory, is there a way to make it 
just calculate checksum without copying(downloading) it?

Or if there's just alternative way please let me know.
