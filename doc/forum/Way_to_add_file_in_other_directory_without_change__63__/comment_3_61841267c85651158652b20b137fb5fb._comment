thanks, but It seems git annex import is just same as 

```
cd ~/annex/
cp /mnt/nas/FILE FILE
git annex add FILE

or

git annex addurl file:///mnt/nas/FILE
```

Is there a way to avoid copying file when trying to add file in annex repository, but do all the required operations like checksum calculation (as it is already accessible in local filesystem through nas)
