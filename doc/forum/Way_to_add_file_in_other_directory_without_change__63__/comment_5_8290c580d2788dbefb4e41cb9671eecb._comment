Thanks joey. This is almost close to what I wanted. 
But I wanted to naviagate and open the file without \"annex get\" the content.
When I add file in this way, dead symbolic link is created and it would end like  

```
a.mp4 -> .git/annex/objects/w6/X8/***.mp4/***.mp4
```

It would be great if it can be something like this

```
a.mp4 -> .git/annex/objects/w6/X8/***.mp4/***.mp4 -> /mnt/nas/a.mp4
```

It might not be proper feature, just asking if it's possible or alternative way for doing this.

Or

Is there way to get the original directory of the file? Something like this  
```
$ git annex {somecommand} a.mp4 # Output: /mnt/nas/a.mp4
```

I couldn't find a way to do this with `whereis`. If it's possible I could just write custom xdg-open command.
