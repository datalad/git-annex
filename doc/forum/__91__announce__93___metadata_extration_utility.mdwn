Let me announce 'metatag', a simple metadata extraction utility.

The Design Idea is to make it completely event driven. There are string matching rules over added metadata,
who invoke engines when matched, which in turn add more metadata and so on.
Thus the whole metadata extraction process is controlled by those easily configurable rules. Processing a file or
directory just starts by adding "/=filename" to the metadata, everything else bootstraps from that. After metadata
got extracted there are exporters which implement different backends for storing this metadata (currently only a
'print' and a 'gitannex' exporter are implemented)

While still in a infancy state it already works for me. It now needs more rules and engines for metadata extraction
and some more efforts to 'standardize' generated metadata. I'd like to welcome comments and contributions.

A README about it can be found at

 <http://git.pipapo.org/?p=metatag;a=blob_plain;f=README>

The code is available under git from

    git clone git://git.pipapo.org/metatag

To make the contribution barrier as low as possible there is a public pushable 'mob' repository where everyone can
send changes too at `git://git.pipapo.org/mob/metatag`

after installing it, using it on a annexed directory is like

    metatag -r -O gitannex,gitexclude -o gitannex:-stat ./
