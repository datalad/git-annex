If the laptop has not pulled from the server since those files were sent to
it, it does not know the server contains the files yet. So it will try to
send them again. Normally this won't result in the same content being
actually sent again, instead for each file it will check if the file is in
the server yet, and when it sees it is, it won't send it again.

My first guess is that just the network overhead of doing those checks is
what "fills the upstream".

It is possible that it's actually re-uploading files that the server
already has, without checking it first, which will result in the server
accepting the upload and then throwing it away, since it already has the content.
This can happen eg, if the same file is being sent into a repository from
two other repositories at the same time. But I don't know of any common
situations where it happens. 

So, if you're sure it's doing that, please provide details about what exact
git-annex commands you're running that are causing it to do that.
