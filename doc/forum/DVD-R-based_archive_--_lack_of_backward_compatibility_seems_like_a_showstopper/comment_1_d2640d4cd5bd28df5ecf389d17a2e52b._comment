I understand your pain (and have just made git-annex support reading V3
repos without upgrading them). But, it's not a good idea to make git-annex
support reading all previous repository versions without an upgrade step.

Suggest you plan on copying your DVD-R to a writable medium to access it,
if git-annex at some point stops supporting the old repo version without
upgrade.
