Just passing the `--cookie` option to `curl` doesn't do it; what I need is to automatically fetch the current cookies from the browser and use those every time, i.e. to run custom code at download time. The old `web-download-command` option would have worked fine; alternatively, a setting to run a script to generate the curl options would also work.
