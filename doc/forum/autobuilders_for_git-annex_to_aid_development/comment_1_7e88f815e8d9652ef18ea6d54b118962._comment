I've some binaries for OSX which can be found at <http://www.sgenomics.org/~jtang/gitbuilder-git-annex-x00-x86_64-apple-darwin10.8.0-binary/dist/> its just the master branch, and it's built on a system that runs macports. Binaries are built and updated whenever there are changes made to the master branch of git-annex.
