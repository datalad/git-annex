Despite v6 repo format being available now, git-annex still defaults to v5,
and so needs to use direct mode when run in a FAT filesystem. If you want
to use v6 repo mode, you will need to `git annex init --version=6`

Based on some googling, "stuck" state in OSX top means that it's stuck in a
kernel call. This probably means that git-annex is waiting for a disk
access, or from output from one of its child processes (eg git commands).

It would be helpful to look at the process tree and see what child
processes of git-annex are running at this point.
