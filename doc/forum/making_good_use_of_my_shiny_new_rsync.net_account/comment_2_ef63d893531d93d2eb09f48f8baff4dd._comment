Note that you don't need to shut down the assistant; you can run multiple git-annex commands simulantaneously safely.
You will probably want to set that repository to be in the manual group in the assistant though.

Another way to do it is to make rsync.net a small archive, and move or copy your important files into `archive` directories.

You can also set up multiple remotes using the same rsync.net account. So you could have a transfer remote that's used to ship files between clients, as well as your archive remote.
