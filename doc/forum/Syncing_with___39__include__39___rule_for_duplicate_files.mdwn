I have the following problem. I have file in git annex repo which is in two places in this repo.
So there are two links to the file in the working tree.
Let say (for clarity) that its path is: a/foo and b/foo.

And when I do:

    git annex wanted . "include=a/*"
    git annex sync --content

git-annex downloads the file and then drops it
(i.e. it try to get a/foo and then drop b/foo).

What should I do to avoid droping the file when include only
one link to the file?

The only one solution to the problem I've found is to use
deprecated 'direct' mode, but let's say I want to do this the right way.
