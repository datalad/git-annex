I'm running version 5.20131224-g692aa01 standalone tarball on linux x86_64 (Linux Mint 15). When I run `git-annex status` in the terminal I get no output. 

I've tried:

* system linked (`ln -s`) the `git-annex`, `git-annex-shell`, and `git-annex-webapp` to `~/bin/` which is on my PATH
* run the `runshell` program from the terminal 

Other things to consider:

* I've just upgraded the repo from version 3 to version 5
* Repo was created using git-annex version 3 
* I don't use assistant or the webapp
* Only used from my terminal
* Repo is in indirect mode

What do I need to do to see the results of `git-annex status`? in my terminal?
