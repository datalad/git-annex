My particular example is that I’m using git-annex:

• mostly as an archive (esp. in family files context),

• but also as a sort-of FLOSS Dropbox for some specific files, that we’re editing.

I’d like to prevent easy (accidental, really) editing of those archived files.

Does this make sense?

Thank you!
