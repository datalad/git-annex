How many files are in the directory tree you're copying?

`copy --fast --to` does indeed avoid the check to see if the remote already has the file before copying it.

However, it still needs to look in the location log to see which files are already present on the remote. Whereas `copy --from` can do a single stat of the file on disk to see if it's present in the local repo. Location log lookups are about as fast as I can make them, but they still require requesting info from out of the git repository. If you have a lot of files this otherwise minor difference in speed can stack up..
