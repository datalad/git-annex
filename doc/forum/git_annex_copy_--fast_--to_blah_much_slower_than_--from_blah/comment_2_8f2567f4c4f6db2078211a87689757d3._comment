That example I gave: 10 sec vs 1 sec is on a repository of pictures with about 6200 files on a SSD.

Oh, I think I understand the source of the asymmetry, now! So, `git annex copy --to` queries the location log file by file? I've tested a `git grep` on the git-annex branch as follows

```
git grep -e <repo uuid> git-annex
```

and seems to be quite fast, less than a second on my test repo. Could git annex make use of this to speed up bulk queries to the location log?
