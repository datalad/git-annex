Right, it's a feature of v6 mode that `git add` adds the file to the annex,
unless annex.largefiles is configured to make it be added directly to the
git repository.

To switch your small files that are currently annexed to be added
directly to git, the easiest way is:

	git annex unannex $file
	git -c 'annex.largefiles=exclude=*' add $file
