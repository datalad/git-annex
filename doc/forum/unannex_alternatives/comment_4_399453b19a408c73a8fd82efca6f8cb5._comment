This is still occurring for me. If I unannex, then commit the deletion, drop the key, and add back the file now with `git add`, annex usurps the commit and commits only a pointer. Then, `git annex find --unlocked` shows the file as an unlocked annexed file.

`git show HASH` shows the pointer, not the file contents, thus my worry that the contents are lost in the git repo. What's worse, `git hash-object` gives the same hash as shown in `git log --raw` so by plain inspection of the log it seems like the content is properly logged in the git repo but it's not!

It appears the bug you mentioned has been closed/deleted (instead of moved to done). I am going to reopen it and put in my details.
