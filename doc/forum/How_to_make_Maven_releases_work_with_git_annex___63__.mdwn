Hi,

In normal maven release procedure, it re-clones the gitrepo from the tag to do the release from either git or local file, But as git-annex uses symlinks when the repo is clones by maven, it misses the files. Any recommendations how i can make this work ? 

Also would love some data on who is using git-annex in production environment would be good.
