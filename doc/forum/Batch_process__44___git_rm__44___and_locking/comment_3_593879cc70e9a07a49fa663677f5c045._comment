`registerurl` does not touch the git index so uses the usual git-annex
locking that supports concurrency.

Interestingly, `git commit` does not hold the index.lock while waiting for
the editor anymore. Despite git's lock failure message still suggesting
that as the most common reason for a lock to fail. So the window for this
race is narrower than it used to be. (Also this surprisingly means that you
can `git add` (or `git-annex add` while `git commit` is in the editor and
stage files that will be included in the ongoing commit!)

Also the index lock is just the git lock that I've seen be a problem
before. git does have some other locks that could in some situation be a
problem with concurrency. See core.filesreflocktimeout for one example.

git-annex's locking method is not without problems either, see
[[todo/withExclusiveLock_blocking_issue]].
