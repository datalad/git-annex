The lock you need to worry about here is for `.git/index`,
which both `git rm` and `git-annex addurl` need to modify
(when the latter is adding new files, not adding urls to existing files).
Unfortunately git's handling of that lock file doesn't play well with multiple
processes (unlike git-annex's other lock files that it uses).

With --batch, git-annex reads a line, handles it, outputs a response, and
waits for the next line. It should not keep any lock held while it's
waiting for the line. So, you should be able to schedule your `git rm`
to happen at that point and not have problems with locks colliding.
