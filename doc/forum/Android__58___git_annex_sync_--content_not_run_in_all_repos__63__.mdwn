I have two repositories in an Android device, and each is synced with a corresponding repo in a computer:

A-android <-> A-computer

B-android <-> B-computer

Both are configured as "client: a repository on your computer".


One of the repositories (say, A) has the expected behavior (changes in the Android device show in the computer and viceversa).

The other repo pair doesn't. Changes in the computer do appear in the Android device, but not the other way around. I can get them to appear if, in the computer, I do

~/B-computer$ git annex sync --content

but not otherwise. For example, from the Android web app clicking "sync" in B-android or B-computer does not make the changes in the Android appear in the computer. 

I am very new to git annex, but I do not understand this; I've searched around to no avail; I think that I should expect sync to run for all repositories

then maybe not to do what I expect: [http://git-annex.branchable.com/sync/#comment-1a0a053001ef684a0f3c5325e8062483](http://git-annex.branchable.com/sync/#comment-1a0a053001ef684a0f3c5325e8062483).


The problem with the behavior I see is that in addition to making me unsure if I am seeing the latest stuff when I do, say, "ls" or "cat", it leads to trouble (if I edit the same file in both the Android and the computer, eventually I will get a conflict, of course). If this is by design, is there a way to get all of the repositories to show the first behavior (changes propagated android <-> computer)?
