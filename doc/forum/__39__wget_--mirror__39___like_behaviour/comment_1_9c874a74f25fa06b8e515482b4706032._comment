There is not, but if you can find a way to get wget or something to
generate a list of urls and the files it downloaded them to, you can
feed that into `git-annex addurl --batch` to teach git-annex what the urls
are.

There is a subsystem in git-annex that could in theory be used for this,
[[git-annex-import]] can import trees of files from a special remote.

But the complexity of mirroring a website makes me think I would not want
to try to support it in the web special remote. I mean, just look at how
many options wget has that you might use to control how the mirroring
works.

Other special remotes can support importing from specific types of websites
though. Currently this is limited to built-in special remotes, such as S3,
but it would be possible to expand it to support external special remotes
as well. See [[todo/importtree_only_remotes]] for discussion about doing
that.
