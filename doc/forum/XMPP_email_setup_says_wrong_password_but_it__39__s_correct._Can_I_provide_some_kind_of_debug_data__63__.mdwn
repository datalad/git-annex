git-annex-assistant is so exciting...

Can't set up XMPP sharing. The web app says "Wrong Password" for my gmail/home-google-apps/work-google-apps addresses, but they are correct.

I'd love to send some debug output, can anyone tell me how to get it? Of course if I'm just doing something wrong and you have an FAQ link or similar, feel free to RTFM me :)

I'm on Ubuntu 12.04 running https://downloads.kitenet.net/git-annex/linux/3.20121112/git-annex-standalone-amd64.tar.gz
