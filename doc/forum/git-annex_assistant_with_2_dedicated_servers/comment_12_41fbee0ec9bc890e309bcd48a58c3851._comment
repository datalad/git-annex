Hello,

Thanks for your help and explanation. Now I had some time to test git-annex and I had a sad experience. I tried to sync the files from server1 to server2 (as described before). We are talking about 87000 small files (these are maildir folders and each file is an e-mail) with the total size of 19 Gbytes. After a few hours git-annex assistant consumed all memory on both servers ... and then all swap ... and then kernel killed git-annex. The servers have 512 MB RAM and 1 GB swap.

According to the Scalability page (http://git-annex.branchable.com/scalability/) the \"memory usage should be constant\" and I am sure I didn't run \"git-annex unused\".

Is this memory consumption normal or it might be a bug? What shall we do?

Thanks,

David
