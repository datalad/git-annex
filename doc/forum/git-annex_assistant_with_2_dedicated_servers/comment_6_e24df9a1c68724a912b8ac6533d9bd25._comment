Hello,

Yes, meanwhile files started appearing. :) Maybe I just did not wait enough time.

So, I have just one more question. Shall I set the remote ssh repositories to client or transfer? I read the docs and understand the difference, but in my case I simply cannot decide. 

Thanks a lot for your hard work and great support. 

David
