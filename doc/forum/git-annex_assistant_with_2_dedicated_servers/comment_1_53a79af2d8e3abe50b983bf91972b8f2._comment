The [[assistant/remote sharing walkthrough]] assumes that the computers are not servers, so they might not be turned on at the same time, and cannot directly contect each other.

With 2 servers, it's much simpler. Just add a git remote on each pointing at the git repository on the other server, and run the git-annex assistant on both to keep them in sync.

You can add the git remote with `git remote add otherserver ssh://otherserver/path/to/repo`, or you can use the webapp to do it (Add another repository -> Remote server)

(If your WAN puts the servers on the same virtual subnet, ie a VPN, you can also probably use local pairing over the WAN to get to the same setup by a different route.)
