Great. Understood. :) Thanks.

Although there is one more thing that I don't really understand. Why do we need 2 repositories. In my mind (without knowing git) I thout it would work with one repository, where both server1 and server2 can upload/download files and they got synced through this. 

    server1 <-> repository (somewhere, eother server1 or server2) <-> server2

Now they use different repositories and I don't get why. Also I don't get how conflict-handling can be done if there are 2 repositories for the 2 transfer-ways.

Sorry to bother you with this.
