Okay. One last question. Could you please help me understand how this sync works now? 

So for example if I save a file on server1, it gets pushed to server2's repository. But how is it translated back to a normal file from the repository?

And in this case will this file be on server2's repository as well (so are there 2 copies on server2, one in the repository and one human-readabl)?

Thanks!
