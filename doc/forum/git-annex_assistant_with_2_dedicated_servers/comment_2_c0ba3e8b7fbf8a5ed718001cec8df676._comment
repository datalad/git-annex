Hello,

Thanks for your reply. I guessed that there is an easier, direct way to do it. But unfortunately I still need some clarification. This is how I tried:

1. Cleared everything to start from scratch.
2. I started git-annex on server1: screen git annex webapp --listen=server1_ip, opened the webapp and created the local repository /media/mail
3. I configured the XMPP account on server1.
4. Started git-annex on server2: screen git annex webapp --listen=server2_ip, opened the webapp and created the local repository /media/mail
5. I configured the XMPP account on server2.

And here comes the confusing part:

6. On server1 I clicked Add another repository / Remote server: and configured ssh server2 to the same folder: /media/mail. I chose client repository group instead of transfer. (I am not sure if I did it right) ... but server1 started sync-ing.
7. On server2 I clicked Add another repository / Remote server: and configured ssh server1 to the same folder: /media/mail. Then I received an error message:

    Failed to make repository
    Something went wrong setting up the repository on the remote server.
    
    Transcript:
    
    init  error: could not lock config file /media/mail-test/mail/.git/config: Permission denied
    git-annex: git [Param \"config\",Param \"annex.version\",Param \"3\"] failed

Cold you please help me where I did wrong?

Thanks,

David
