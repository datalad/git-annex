Hey,

Yes, you were right. The ssh user did not have privileges to read/write the folder. Now I have corrected this issue and things started sync-ing.

But I am afraid, this is not exactly the thing I wanted to achieve. My goal was to sync from folder to folder ... and not from folder to repository both ways.

So, what I would like to do is that if I create a file at server1 (e.g. /media/mail/test01.txt) then it should appear at server2 at /media/mail/test01.txt.

How can I achieve this?

Thanks a lot.

David
