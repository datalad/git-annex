Thought I'd ask how y'all are finding the current communication by this forum/website/git repo only.

Would there be a benefit to having an irc channel for git-annex?

Maybe a mailing list? (Any persuasive reason why it would be better than this forum?)

Are the existing RSS feeds on this site, for eg, new [[comments]] and posts to this forum, sufficient to keep up with
things?
