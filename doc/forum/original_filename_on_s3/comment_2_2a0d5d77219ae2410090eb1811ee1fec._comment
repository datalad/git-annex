What real filenames? A git-annex special remote is a key/value store, where
any key can correspond to zero or any number of filenames in the working
tree. 

What you're doing with S3 is using it to publish some files over the web.
Fine. That's not a S3 special remote, so don't use it that way, just `git
annex addurl` the files from S3.
