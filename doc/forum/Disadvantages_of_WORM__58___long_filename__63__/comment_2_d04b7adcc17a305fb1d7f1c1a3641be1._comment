I refreshed my memory and did some testing, and the WORM backend
deals with extremely large filenames by detecting the filename length
limitations of the filesystem where the repository is located, and if a
WORM key is longer than the maximum filename length, it will truncate it
down to fit.

This avoids any problems in my testing, as long as the WORM keys are being
generated and used all on filesystems with similar filename length limits.
If you are using a version of git-annex older than 4.20131024, it won't
do that, and you should upgrade.

If you are using a mixture of filesystems, eg EXT4 and VFAT, this can still
result in WORM key names generated on EXT4 being too long to fit on the
VFAT filesystem. In this case, I would recommend not using WORM.

Incidentially, that version also made many problematic characters
not be included in WORM key names, so they're more portable to eg, FAT
filesystems.
