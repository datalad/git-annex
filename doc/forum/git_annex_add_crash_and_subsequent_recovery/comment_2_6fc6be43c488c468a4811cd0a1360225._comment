The bug with newlines is now fixed.

Thought I'd mention how to clean up from interrupting `git annex add`.
When you do that, it doesn't get a chance to `git add` the files it's
added (this is normally done at the end, or sometimes at points in the middle when you're adding a *lot* of files).
Which is also why fsck, whereis, and unannex wouldn't operate on them, since they only deal with files in git.

So the first step is to manually use `git add` on any symlinks.

Then, `git commit` as usual.

At that point, `git annex unannex` would get you back to your starting state.
