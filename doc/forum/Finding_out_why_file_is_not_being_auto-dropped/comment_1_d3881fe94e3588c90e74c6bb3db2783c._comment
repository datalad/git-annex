`git-annex drop` only operates on files in the current subdirectory
and below, so it won't do anything about a key that is not used by any
file.

Run `git-annex unused` and then `git-annex drop --unused` to deal
with such keys.

All it takes to create a key that is not referenced by anything in
the repository is adding it and then never committing the file.
For example:

	git-annex add foo
	rm foo
	git rm --cached foo
