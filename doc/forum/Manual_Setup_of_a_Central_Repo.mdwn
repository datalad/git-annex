My current setup involves 3 computers, one desktop one laptop and a vps. In my current setup I have created annex repos on the server and cloned from it, both machines sync to the server. All three use non base repos. Now I have another annex folder on the desktop that I would like to sync between the three. Both machines are behind NAT so server can not communicate with the machines. In order to init the repo on the vps, I was thinking of setting up a temporary VPN/port forward between the desktop and the VPS then clone from the desktop finally remove the remote section in .git/config on the server so VPS becomes the master again. First of all is there an easier way to do this? if not is it safe to do this? or is it going to cause problems down the line.
