It seems I could sort things of.

I have run git annex sync from another annex. It took 30 minutes but could synchronize with the slow annex. Then I launched git annex sync on the slow annex (the one which seemed to had troubles with the repair command). It took 278 minutes, used all my ram and swap, but managed to end successfully.

I launched git annex sync again today, another 279 minutes:

    vincent@berlioz:~/photos2$ time git annex sync

I will try to do some git gc.
