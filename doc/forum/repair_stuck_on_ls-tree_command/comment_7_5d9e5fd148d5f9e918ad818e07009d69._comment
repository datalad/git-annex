Hi,

I have uploaded the repository to:
http://dl.free.fr/bczxhyOhy

You can decrypt it with your gpg key. It weights 200 Mo.

Moreover when I try to run git annex whereis on files present only on the defective annex from another annex I get the following error:

    $ git annex whereis IMG_4701.JPG
    whereis IMG_4701.JPG (0 copies) failed
    git-annex: whereis: 1 failed

I guess the defective annex could not completely synchronize with the others.

I also tried to look at the git tree with gitk --all.
Well there seems to be a lot of commit with message update (recovery from race)
I am forced to kill gitk because it starts lagging a lot.

Hopefully you will be able to provide me some hints on how to resolve this issue.

Best regards
