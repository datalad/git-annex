According to the ls-tree output you posted, the git tree object
5fe5193e079631c0ceac0688ae0a6c1636491b61 is somehow 11 mb
in size, which seems quite enormous, since a git tree object
is just a list of files in a directory in the repo.

Does your repository actually contain a directory that big? 
(This seems unlikely, since git annex info says there are only 59117 annxed
files.)

What is in the output of `git-ls-tree 5fe5193e079631c0ceac0688ae0a6c1636491b61`
that is so enormous?

I think you need to figure this out to get anywhere, because it's quite
strange. Or, if you're willing to put the git repository someplace
(minus .git/annex/), I could take a look at it.
