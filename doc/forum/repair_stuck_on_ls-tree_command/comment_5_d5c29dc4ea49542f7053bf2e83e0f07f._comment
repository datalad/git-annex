The output of the ls-tree command suggests this tree is the git-annex branch at some point in time.

I tried on my photos annex to ls-tree the git-annex branch and got.

    $ git ls-tree -r --full-tree git-annex | wc
    156405  625620 23685538

My git-annex tree is about 22Mib in size, that means twice bigger than yours (no
dumb joke intended) and I don't suffer such problem.
