No, interrupting will never lose previous incremental progress. In fact, if
you interrupt `--more` and run the same command again, it will skip all
files that were recorded as checked already by the first `--more`.

I suspect you were reading a previous version of the man page, which
discussed being interrupted under `--incremental`. That wording was
recently adjusted.
