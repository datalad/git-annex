Please tell me if I'm getting this right:

- `--incremental` starts a *new* incremental fsck, regardless of whether there was a previously interrupted fsck or not
- `--more` also starts a new incremental fsck but only if there wasn't a previously interrupted incremental fsck in which case it resumes that to the end

So if I do `git-annex fsck --more` on a repo without previously interrupted incremental fsck, it is effectively the same as `--incremental`?
