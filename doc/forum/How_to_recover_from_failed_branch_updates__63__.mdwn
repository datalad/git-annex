Due to the issue reported in [[bugs/Failed_adjusted_branch_update_after_error_in_drop]], my git-annex repo is now is a limbo state:


```
$ git branch --show-current
adjusted/master(unlockpresent)

$ git annex drop dirF/
drop dirF/a/a1.txt ok
drop dirF/a/a2.txt ok
[...]
error: Your local changes to the following files would be overwritten by checkout:
    dirF/a/a1.txt
    dirF/a/a2.txt
    [...]

Aborting

  Updating adjusted branch failed.
(recording state in git...)
$ git status
HEAD detached at 9d92415fb
nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

What is the recommended course of action to (safely) return to the `adjusted/master(unlockpresent)` branch?

Is it safe to just use `git annex adjust --unlock-present`?
