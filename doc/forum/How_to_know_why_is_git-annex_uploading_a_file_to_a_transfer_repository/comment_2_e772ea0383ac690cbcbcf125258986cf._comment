I thought I had already checked all does possibilities, the repositories where in the correct group and no new repositories had been added. *git annex info* didn't show anything weird and nor did *git annex whereis*. I finally found out *git annex vicfg* and I found two new repositories with no name in the repository groups. It looked something like this:

    # (for )
    group repository-hash = client
    # (for )
    group repository-hash = client


No idea of how they got there, but setting both of them to unwanted solved the issue.
