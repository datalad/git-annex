A few likely reasons:

* If a 4th client repository had popped up. 
* If you have configured a high number of copies, it might only be able to be met by keeping files on the transfer repository.
* Similarly, if a repository that used to have the files has been marked as dead or deleted, more copies might be needed to make up for that.
* For completeness, if the transfer repository accidentally had its type changed to some other kind of repository, like a full backup.

You can enable debugging (start with --debug or go into the webapp's preferences) and it might say a little more, but the debugging info is not very good.

The best thing is probably to look at one single file, use `git annex whereis` on the file to see what repositories contain it, and then think about how that interacts with the [[preferred_content_expression_of_the_transfer_repository|preferred_content/standard_groups]].
