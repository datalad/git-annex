Say I have a git annex repository with one regular remote.  The status of both remotes is clean.

If I run `git annex sync` in the main remote, it will not create any commits.

However, running sync alternatively in both remotes will keep creating regular and merge commits.

I wonder if it would be possible to avoid this behavior.
