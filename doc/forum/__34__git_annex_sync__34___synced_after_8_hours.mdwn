Hi,

The git annex seem has problem with many files.

For synchronize, the operation lasts 8 hours. Here the sample for synchronizing to my local remote server (sbackup)

start at **20:12** / end at **04:13** / total time = ~ **8 hours**

    git annex sync sbackup
    
    [2015-04-13 20:12:26 CEST] call: git ["--git-dir=.git","--work-tree=.","push","sbackup","+git-annex:synced/git-annex","master:synced/master"]

    ok

Another problem, I do not know exactly how many files I own (i use **find . | wc -l** )

.git = 1250633

documents = 61124

medias = 199504

it seem i own ~250000 files, but in the .git **1.2 millions files**.

The following command also very slow

    git annex info


What the best pratices for use git annex with many files > 500 000 or maintenance & reduction/cleaning method

Thanks
