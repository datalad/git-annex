I used to save movies with the srt subtitle files next to them. 

Usually vlc finds it because it's on the same directory than the movie file, however with git annex the link is located on another folder.
So after adding movies to git, the subtitles doesn't load anymore.

couldn't find a quick fix. I'm thinking a bash script, but wanted to discuss it here with all annex users.

I know It's out of annex scope, but I think a movie archive is a great scenario for git-annex.
most of my HD is filled up with movies from the camcorder, screencast, etc... 
And we usually don't modify those files
