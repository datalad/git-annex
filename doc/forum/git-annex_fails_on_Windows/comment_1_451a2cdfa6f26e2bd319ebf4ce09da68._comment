This is a mismatch between the version of git that git-annex was compiled
to use, and the version of git that you have installed.

You seem to have a git version older than 1.8.1.6 installed, since
"--literal-pathspecs" was first added in that version. According
to the [Windows installation instructions](http://git-annex.branchable.com/install/Windows),
you need to install msysgit 1.9 to use git-annex.

So, upgrade..
