This works, but it's very inneficient. You're
adding metadata (which is committed to git!) to represent location information. 
git-annex already knows about location information,
so it could just look at it and use it to build the view.

The reason I haven't implemented this yet is I'm not clear about what to do
if a file is dropped while in a view. It seems like git-annex should update
the view to no longer show the dropped file. But this means that any change
to a file's presence needs to update the view, and so it entangles the
implementation of views with a core part of git-annex. And it might be
pretty inneficient to need to build a new view branch each time a file is
dropped too.

With your hack, the view doesn't automatically update when a file is
dropped. Since you're using it this way, maybe you have some advice or
thoughts about this question?
