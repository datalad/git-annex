Well, `git annex sync` does not itself run `git status`. 

Try running git-annex with the --debug option, it will say what git
commands it runs, and that should help find out which git command is
complaining.

My guess is it's `git commit`, which  is probably getting the status
unncessarily for a commit message template, despite a commit message
being specified. If so, `git annex sync --no-commit` would avoid
that.
