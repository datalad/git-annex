One of the most impressive aspects of <a href=\"https://melon-playground.io/online/\">Melon Playground</a> is its physics system. Every action feels meaningful because small changes can lead to very different outcomes. Whether you’re connecting objects, applying pressure, or testing explosions, the results often feel unpredictable and entertaining. This makes experimentation highly addictive, as players are constantly curious to see “what happens if” they try something new.

The ragdoll physics of the characters add another layer of fun. Watching how they react to impacts, tools, and environmental hazards can be both humorous and fascinating, especially when combined with creative setups.
