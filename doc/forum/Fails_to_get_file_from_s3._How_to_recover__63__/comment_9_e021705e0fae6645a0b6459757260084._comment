My best guess at the moment is that the corruption must have something to
do with using a partsize.

Since you were able to get at the corrupted files, can you characterize at
all how they were corrupted?

In particular, did the corruption start at some multiple of N GiB?
into the file? If so, that would correlate with your 1 GiB part size.

Or was it just a small area of corruption?

Or is the corrupt file truncated?
