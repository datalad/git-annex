What you could try is:

	git config remote.s3.annex-gnupg-options --ignore-mdc-error
	git config remote.s3.annex-verify false

That should make gpg ignore the error and proceed, and make git-annex
not try to verify the download either. The resulting file will probably
be corrupt in some way. It might have a bad chunk in the middle, or be
truncated, or be garbage past a certian point.

This sounds like something went wrong with the multipart upload to S3.
What does `git annex info s3` say about the configuration of your S3
remote? I'd like to reproduce this problem, if possible. Since it hit two
of your files, it seems to not have been some kind of one-off data
corruption problem.
