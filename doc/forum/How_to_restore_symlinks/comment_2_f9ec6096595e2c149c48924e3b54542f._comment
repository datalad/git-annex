The key thing to realize is that the symlinks used by git-annex are checked into git like any other file would be. So you can use the entire git toolkit to manage them. 

For example, you could run `git status` to see if git shows them as recently deleted, and then use `git checkout $file` to restore the deleted files. 

Or perhaps the deletion has been committed to git, and then you'd use `git log --stat` to find the commit that deleted your files, and `git revert` could be used to undo it.

(`git annex fix` is not related to this and won't help.)
