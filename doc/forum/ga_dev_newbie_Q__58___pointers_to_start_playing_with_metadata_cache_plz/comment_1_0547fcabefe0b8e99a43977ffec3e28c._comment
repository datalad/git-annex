To not sit idle, I've been looking for development branches (specifically the one containing code that gave the rise to Joey's claim \"Querying for 30000 keys that all have a particular tag in their metadata takes 0.65s.\"), but could find only repos with the one branch - the master branch, which doesn't (naturally seem to) include the code for SQLite metadata tinkering.

Is there someplace I could find such development branches please?
