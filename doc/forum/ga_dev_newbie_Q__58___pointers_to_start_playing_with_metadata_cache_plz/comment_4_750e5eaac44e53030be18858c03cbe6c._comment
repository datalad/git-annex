Yeah, you found the stuff. That's as far as the metadata cache idea has
gotten yet. I've restored the missing "database" branch, which was just
that commit you found.

I do hope to circle back around to this eventually to speed up generating
views and other metadata queries.

But, as a programmer, you could create your own sqlite database and put
metadata about your git-annex repository in it. Using
`git annex metadata --batch --json` you can query git-annex
for metadata about your files as fast as it can pull it out of git,
and shove it into your database, and then write your own sql queries.

That would be a good first step, because working with real-world
data would help develop the sql schema and see if it'll be fast enough to
bother with putting into git-annex.
