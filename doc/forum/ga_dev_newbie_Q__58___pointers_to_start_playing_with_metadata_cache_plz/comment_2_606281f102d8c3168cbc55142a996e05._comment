Did you clone the repository?

    $ git clone git://git-annex.branchable.com/ git-annex

I see lots of branches (remember they are *remote* branches so you will need the `-a` flag):

    $ git branch -a
    * master
      remotes/origin/HEAD -> origin/master
      remotes/origin/atomic-store-test
      remotes/origin/debian
      remotes/origin/debian-jessie-backport
      remotes/origin/debian-squeeze-backport
      remotes/origin/debian-stable-security-fix
      remotes/origin/debian-wheezy-backport
      remotes/origin/ghc7.0
      remotes/origin/improved-smudge-filters
      remotes/origin/master
      remotes/origin/newwinrelease
      remotes/origin/no-direct-mode
      remotes/origin/p2p-map
      remotes/origin/setup
      remotes/origin/smudge
      remotes/origin/tweak-fetch
      remotes/origin/uuid-type-rework
      remotes/origin/winsplicehack

You can checkout one of the branches like:

    $ git checkout remotes/origin/setup

Does that help?
