Hi,

thanks for your reply. The repo server I used to store just the repository does not need to have git-annex installed, correct? As long as I do not intend to use it for exchanging files... 

This message can be ignored?

    Remote xgm does not have git-annex installed; setting annex-ignore

    This could be a problem with the git-annex installation on the remote. Please make sure that git-annex-shell is available in PATH when you ssh into the remote. Once you have fixed the git-annex installation, run: git annex enableremote xgm
