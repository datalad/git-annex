Says that should have been fixed in ndk-r8c's gcc, but git-annex is already built with ndk-r9b. It might be though, that the llvm compiler still has the problem. In any case, I doubt there is a real security issue here, it's probably just a binary exploit hardening thing.

As for the git log, git users the less pager by default, but of course it's not necessary and so not included on Android. You can `git config core.pager cat` to get around this.
