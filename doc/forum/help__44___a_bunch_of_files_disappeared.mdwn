I have a large repo full of movies (dvd and blue-ray rips). I host it on my ubuntu linux 16.04 xenial system which sits next to my tv.

I use git annex sync to copy stuff to my mac laptop running high sierra and I just updated to the brew version of git-annex there, 6.20171109

I also have a copy on my really old laptop running mac os x lion, that one has a really really old version running.

I hadn't done a git annex sync in a long time. so I updated via brew on my high sierra laptop to 6.20171109 and ran git annex sync on the laptop, and then on my server.

when I ran git annex sync on my server, i saw it modify the 6 or so movies which I had copied over to the old lion laptop long ago. those six movies are now pointed to hashes which don't exist, and when I look at the history, the previous hashes don't exist either.

then I ran a git annex fsck on the server, and it listed tons of movies which is says have no known copies. at some point, all of them were on the server. I suspect, but don't know how to confirm, that all the movies are still sitting in the annex on the server, but many many of the links are wrong.

how can I fix the links?

thanks.
