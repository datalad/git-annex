Thanks, that seemed to be the problem!  My router's dnsmasq had the 'filterwin2k' option set, which apparently [blocks queries for SRV records](http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/dhcp.dnsmasq#sip-phones.and.dnsmasq).  This may be fixed in newer OpenWRT versions, but my device is no longer supported.
