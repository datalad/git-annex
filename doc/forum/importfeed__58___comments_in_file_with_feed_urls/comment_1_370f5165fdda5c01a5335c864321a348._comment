Well, this seems to work:

	git annex importfeed --fast http://www.starshipsofa.com/feed/#award-winning-science-fiction-podcast

But that limits you to url formatted comments. Instead, you could make
the list of feeds into a shell script.

	#!/bin/sh
	# award winning science fiction podcast
	git annex importfeed http://www.starshipsofa.com/feed/

Or, you could strip out comments from the list of feeds before passing it to
git-annex:

	sed 's/#.*//' feeds | xargs git-annex importfeed

How you do it is really up to you..
