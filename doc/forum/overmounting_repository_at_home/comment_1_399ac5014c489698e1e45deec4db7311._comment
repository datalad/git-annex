From the few details you give, this sounds like a bad idea. git-annex tells different repos apart by using a UUID. You can see this UUID in `.git/config`.

But if you are really insistent on doing this, you could always system link the folder to the spot you want it, then write a script that mounts the server in an arbitrary location and redoes the system link. I'd try this on a copy of the data or with some data that doesn't matter before going for it.
