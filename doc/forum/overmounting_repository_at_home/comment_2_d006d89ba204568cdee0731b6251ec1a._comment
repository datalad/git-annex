I know that this is a bad idea right now when done in a naive approach, I am wondering if git-annex could be made aware of this case and how it could be implemented.
A immature idea for example would be only to overmount the .git/annex/objects folder and let the git-annex check if the objects lay on a different device, if so, refuse to do operation on the object store.

I started this thread to figure out if there is some interest in such functionality and if so, polishing it out to see how it could be done.
