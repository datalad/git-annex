Suggest you run git log --stat to see if you can find a commit that deleted
the missing files. Reverting the commit should then get the files back.

There have been several bugs of this kind in direct mode. Using such an old
git-annex from 2014 makes it more likely you'll hit an old bug like this.

The new v6 repository mode should be much less likely to have this kind of
bug.
