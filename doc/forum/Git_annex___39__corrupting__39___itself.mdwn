Hi,

Since the I updated to `2013-10-24` `git annex` has corrupted itself twice on my setup.  I'm not claiming causality here and thus I haven't filled it as a bug (probably the mistake is mine).

I use three laptops and one remote ssh server.  The motherboard on laptop *T* seems to have broken and I haven't fixed it yet.  I have disabled sync to *T*  on the webapp dashboard.  

First, one computer, called *W*, broke on Friday.  I got the dreaded [serious problem](http://git-annex.branchable.com/devblog/day_41__onward/) screen. `git fsck` reported lots of missing blobs and tree problem, though my data seemed OK.  I git cloned the repo from computer *X*.  Now, last night both X and W reported the same problem (log below).  *W*  recovered itself somehow, but *X*  is now in a cycle of re-adding all files in the repo and the posting the below error that has to do with computer *T* (IP ending with 107).  

I would appreciate hints on why this suddenly started happen.  Computer T has been out of sync for almost 14 days (since the 24th of October I think).
