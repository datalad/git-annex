The "GitLab: You don't have access" seems to be gitlab refusing to run
git-annex-shell when asked to. Only the gitlab people could help you with
that. (Gitlab does seem to work with git-annex today when I try it,
I had some similar problems with their implementation refusing to
start git-annex-shell earlier.)

OTOH, the "git-annex.exe: unknown command git@gitlab.server.com"
looks like you ran into this bug:
<http://git-annex.branchable.com/bugs/git-annex_sync_under_windows_fails_by_using_itself_as_the_ssh_command/>
Since I have still not managed to reproduce or get to the bottom of that
bug report, any information about it would be useful.
