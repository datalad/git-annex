Also, I created git-annex-shell.exe as a copy of git-annex.exe which you recommended here: https://git-annex.branchable.com/bugs/no_git-annex_shell_on_Windows/.

I also made sure UAC and Windows Firewall were disabled and they already were.

What environment variables should exist to support annex? I see references to GIT_ANNEX_SSHOPTION and GIT_SSH, but those aren't currently configured on my Windows server. The git, git-annex and git-annex-shell files are in the global path and accessible from anywhere.
