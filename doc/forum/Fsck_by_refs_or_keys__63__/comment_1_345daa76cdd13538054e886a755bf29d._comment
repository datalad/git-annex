Currently the only way to do that is to make a clone of the bare repsitory
that's not bare. Then run `git annex fsck --from origin` inside the clone.
This is more efficient when the clone is on the same disk as the bare
repository.

Another way to deal with it is to use `git annex dead --key` to
make fsk stop complaining about the specific keys that you don't mind are
gone.
