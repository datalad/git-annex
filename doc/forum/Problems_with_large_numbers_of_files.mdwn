I'm trying to use git-annex to archive scientific data. I'm often dealing with large numbers of files, sometimes 10k or more. When I try to git-annex add these files I get this error:


    Stack space overflow: current size 8388608 bytes.
    Use `+RTS -Ksize' to increase it.


This is with the latest version of git-annex and a current version of git on OS 10.6.7. After this error occurs, I am unable to un-annex the files and I'm forced to recover from a backup.
