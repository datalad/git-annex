story: i got a new drive from the store. plug it in. it's recognized by XFCE and mounted automatically. turns out it's NTFS, but Debian doesn't seem to mind.

go in the assistant, add it as an "External drive", make it a "full backup" and let it sync.

expected result: i see files

actual result: i see a bare git repository.

if i first `git init` the directory so it's not bare, at least i get a better handle on it: i can sync with the assistant, then `git merge synced/master` to see the files.

really confusing to me, sorry if it's a dupe... 

workaround: use the commandline: `git clone <repo>` and `git annex get`. --[[anarcat]]
