Well, in the screencast it seems to work alright.

I only get a \"Syncing with laptop B\" on one side, nothing more happens. I'm not sure if there is a recommended version to follow this screencast, or if the versions need to match (I'm syncing between macos & linux/debian, and the mac packages are lagging behind).

My guess is that the assistant is simply \"not there yet\": using git-annex manually works just fine, but the assistant... ew. :/
