* 1K blocksize is now the default
* \".\" is now the default path
* implemented -B/--block-size option
* --help is no longer -h, it only has a long option like du
* implemented -h/--human-readable option

du will take up to yottabytes for the --block-size option.  I had been fudging the sizes with a size_t thinking 16 exabytes was plenty big enough for now, but since I was implementing --block-size I went ahead and converted everything to use the GNU MP.  So libgmp is now a dependency.

--human-readable probably doesn't have exactly the same output, but I think it is good enough.  I tried to make the options work mostly the same as du from core-utils.  Let me know if you find other discrepancies.

I'll see about making the git tree available soon, but it may have to wait until next weekend.  I may also look into a forum for the website, or a mailing list.
