Thanks a lot, Steve. Awesome, got everything on my wishlist. :) A very useful utility, and works perfectly. Will be using this a lot. git-annex-utils is a good name for this, I'm sure if you place it on GitHub or somewhere else you'll get lots of contributions and this could grow to be a project containing many useful utilities for git-annex.
