I pay attention to feedback ;)

I'm not done with it yet, I want to add in some options to limit what gets counted.

For example:  If you have two annexed files that contain the same content using the same backend, they will be stored only once in the .git/annex/objects directory but be counted twice by gadu.

I want to fix that, but I'll leave an option to keep that behavior if you want.  I also want to add options to count or not count files that exist in a certain repo.  It will be very easy to add options to only count files that you have or don't have locally as well.

Making it pay attention to environment variables that git and git-annex do would also be a good idea. (like GIT_DIR, etc...)

I'm open to good ideas that anybody has, unfortunately I can only work on it on the weekends for now.
