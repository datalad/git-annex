No problem, glad to see it is useful.  I'm not exactly a web guy, but I want to get some sort of comment/discussion system up there soon so we aren't filling up Joey's web site with semi-offtopic discussion.  (also a little beautification is in order)

Yes, contributions are welcome.  GPG/PGP encrypted email is the preferred mode of communication.

Currently I ask for copyright assignment in case I want to change licenses in the future.  I pledge not to go to a non-free license, but the GPL3 license choice was fairly arbitrary.  I might want to add the \"or any later version\" clause, for example.  There is also potential for a library to be split off which might benefit from something like LGPL licensing or similar.  I haven't really studied the licensing situation since GPL3 came around, so I need to take some time to look into it.

I don't want to have a licensing discussion here though as it would be offtopic.  Feel free to email me and we can discuss.
