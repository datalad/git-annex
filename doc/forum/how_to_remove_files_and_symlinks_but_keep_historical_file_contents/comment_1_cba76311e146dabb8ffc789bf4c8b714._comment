A suggestion from #git-annex:

> &lt;mhameed&gt; i think others are already doing this, using branches, but not sure if we have a writeup/tutorial of it
>
> &lt;mhameed&gt; gioele:  instead of working on master branch, switch to laptop branch, git rm the files that are not wanted and commit
>
> &lt;gioele&gt; mhameed: I'm lazy, I'd like git-annex to do that for me :)
