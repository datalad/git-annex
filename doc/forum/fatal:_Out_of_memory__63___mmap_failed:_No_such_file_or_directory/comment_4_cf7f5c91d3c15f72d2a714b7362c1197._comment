[2014-06-29 12:49:57 Mitteleurop├ñische Sommerzeit] call: git [\"--git-dir=C:\\Users\\Name\\Pictures\\.git\",\"--work-tree=C:\\Users\\Name\\Pictures\",\"add\",\"-f\",\"Hochzeit von NameB und NameC/2013-08-17_MVI_9701.MOV\"]

When does git-annex in direct mode run \"git add -f\"? In stageDirect, when a file has been modified that is not an annexed file, but already has been committed  directly to git.

This certainly points in the direction of what the problem is with the repository. I think you need to take a look at `git log --stat \"Hochzeit von NameB und NameC/2013-08-18_MVI_0583.MOV\"` and see if it has been committed to git as a symlink or if it is indeed being stored as a Bin file in git. 

Here's how the log would look for a regular git-annexed symlink:

<pre>
 $somefile | 1 +
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
</pre>

And here for a binary file stored in git:

<pre>
 $somefile | Bin 0 -> 1016920 bytes
 1 file changed, 0 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-)
</pre>

If you find the latter in the log, then the author and commit message of the commit adding it would be interesting.

Hypothesis: Perhaps this repository started off on a Linux or OSX system, and you were using a git-annex older than 5.20131118, when the direct mode guard was added. You might have added this file back then and accidentially committed it directly to git.
