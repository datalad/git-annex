Aha, that what I missed!

Indeed, my original observations weren't entirely correct. Seems like git annex does record it's state periodically.
For some big files where copying took ~1 hour, after running `git annex copy` again it was done almost
immediately. And as you suggested `--not --in=slowremote` should speedup the initial process.

It laterally saved me hours, thanks a lot!

P.S.: Still, it may be probably a good idea to record the progress state to git annex on `ctrl+c` and show a friendly message e.g. \"The operation is interrupted and the progress is recorded. You can safely resume it by running `git annex copy` again.\"
