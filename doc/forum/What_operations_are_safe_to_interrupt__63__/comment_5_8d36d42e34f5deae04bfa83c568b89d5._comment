Git annex can normally resume any operation seamlessly. It can resume from aborted copying and shouldn't need to start over. I suggest:

- setting [annex.queuesize](https://git-annex.branchable.com/git-annex/) to a low value to commit more frequently to the `git-annex` branch (I think that it does that)
- skipping already-present files by specifying `git annex --copy --to=slowremote --not --in=slowremote`, that should speed up the initial phase of finding what to copy and also not display the files that are already copied (maybe that confused you)
