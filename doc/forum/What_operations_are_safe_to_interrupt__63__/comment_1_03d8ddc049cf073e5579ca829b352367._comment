Note that git is not entirely robust against being interrupted.
In particular, interrupting a commit can leave a stale lock file in place,
and committing will then fail until the user manually goes in and removes
the lock file.

I'd say that git-annex is overall more robust against interruptions
than git is, except that git-annex uses git so of course inherits 
its limitations.

git-annex tries to handle all interruptions sanely. Ie, files are always
moved into place atomically so partial writes are not a problem, stale lock
files are not a problem, and any recordkeeping that might be lost by an
interruption should be able to be recovered by running the interrupted
command again, or perhaps `git annex fsck`.

The only problem that I can think of with interuptions is that
since git-annex uses temp files in `.git/annex/tmp` extensively, 
if it's interrupted nothing will clean up those temp files.
