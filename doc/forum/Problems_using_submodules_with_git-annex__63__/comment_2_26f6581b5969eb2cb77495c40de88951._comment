Does this work well even with direct mode ?
How is this managed in direct mode ?

Coming back from direct mode to indirect mode (required when I want to run git commands) I found that the .gitmodules file was an annex symlink (to .git/annex/objects/...). I just recovered from corrupt repository and may have made mistakes, but is this a risk under normal curcumstances ?
