There is a standard group called \"transfer\" which is meant for this kind of thing: <https://git-annex.branchable.com/preferred_content/standard_groups/>. This is especially applicable if there is a static preferred content expression that can be written for each repository (i.e. no ad-hoc gets, just something more structured).

To make it more dynamic you could include a match on a metadata tag in a repositories preferred content expression. Requesting a file would then be setting the tag on it (well, and a bunch of syncing in all repositories).
