I have decided to add importing of another playlist to the same repo (https://github.com/TrueTube/Andriy_Popyk) which already had some videos fetched for another playlist.  First I got confused since my invocation of `git annex importfeed --debug --fast 'https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?playlist_id=PLSWNjjvqdBIsKntshAmYH7HBCv2HLlowX' --template 'Суспільство_і_політика/${itempubdate}-${itemtitle}.mkv'` just silently (no reason even in `--debug` output) did nothing. RTFM pointed me to `--force` flag which "Force downloading items it's seen before." which seemed like a remedy since it quickly added those videos from the play list.  But it is not a clean remedy since rerunning causes `git annex` to re-add those same videos with `2_` prefix, wasting "traffic" and requiring subsequent adhoc `git rm -f folder/2_`.  I wonder if there could be some way to avoid needing that?
