Hi,
we are using git in a research lab to store both code and text log generated by this code. Until now, we are using standard git and then it compresses the text files when they are committed (our text log files have +- 100MB each one). Recently, our institutional git server started to support git-annex and then we are moving from a git only solution to a git + git annex case. Git annex is working like a charm and the operations in our repository are faster after the migration to git annex. However, the files stored with git annex (.git/annex) are not compressed. I understand that git annex was designed to store binary files and then, the compression does not make sense, but I would like to know if it is possible to enable the compression when pushing the files with git-annex?

Thank you for your attention!
