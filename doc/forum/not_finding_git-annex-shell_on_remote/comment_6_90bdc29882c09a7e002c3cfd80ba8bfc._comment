As a solution to my own question, for anyone who stumbles upon this with the same problem...
You don't have to set the path on the remote machine to get this working.

On the local machine, simply do: `git config remote.macbook-remote.annex-shell /usr/local/bin/git-annex-shell`
Then do: `git annex enableremote macbook-remote`
Finally, `git annex sync macbook-remote` to sync it with the remote one.

See: [[https://git-annex.branchable.com/tips/get_git-annex-shell_into_PATH/]]

I don't think this really fixed whatever weirdness is going on with the remote, but thankfully the tip works.
