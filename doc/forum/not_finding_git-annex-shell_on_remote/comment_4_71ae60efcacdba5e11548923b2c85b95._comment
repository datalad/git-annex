@Srinath I wonder if the machine you are running git-annex sync on is a Windows machine? I have seen that \" refs/remotes/origin/synced/master - not something we can merge\" intermittently when testing on Windows, but not other times.

(It's not related to the original PATH configuration problem on your server.)
