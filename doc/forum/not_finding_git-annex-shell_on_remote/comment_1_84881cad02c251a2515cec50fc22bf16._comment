If i don't misremember some systems including Debian require you to set the path on the very first line of .bashrc for it to work. Can't remember why just now.

in other words paste the following into the very first line of `$HOME/.bashrc`

`PATH=$PATH:$HOME/bin:$HOME/bin/git-annex.linux`

Modify the line above if you haven't installed to `~/bin/git-annex.linux`
