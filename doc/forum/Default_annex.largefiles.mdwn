I'm new to git annex, so if this has been discussed before, please forgive me.  The documentation of annex.largefiles seems to say that all files are added to the annex by default.  However, when I tried it, several of my smaller files were not added to the annex.  I admit that I haven't tried changing this value yet.  Has the default changed?  I'm using the package from Arch AUR git-annex-bin. Possibly this version has a different default?
