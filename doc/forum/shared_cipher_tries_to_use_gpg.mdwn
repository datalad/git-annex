I tried 

    git annex initremote encsharedtest type=directory encryption=shared directory=/home/lee/gitannexplay

and got errors:

    initremote encsharedtest gpg: error reading key: public key not found

Looks like it thinks "shared" should be the name of a key rather than an instruction to use the shared cipher.
Am I doing something wrong?
