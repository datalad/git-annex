Just to clarify...

There will be situations where I will want to access other remotes (either networked or special, like an external drive) when I'm blocking access to others (like Glacier).

So, for the music annex example when I'm roaming:

- Remote: external drive  -->  low cost
- Remote: other machine on my local network  -->  medium cost
- Remote: youtube --> high cost  (if, for example, my data provider gives me a certain amount of free youtube streaming...)
- Remote: Glacier  -->  NO

...and in this case if there are files that are only available on Glacier, I'm happy to live without them.

And for the work example, again when roaming:

- Remote: external drive  -->  low cost
- Remote: other machine on my local network  -->  medium cost
- Remote: Glacier  -->  high cost

...but if there is a file I need on Glacier and no where else, then just get it.
