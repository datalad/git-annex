Another good reason to have a separate config is it should probably
block `git annex sync` from pulling/pushing the remote. Cost does not
affect pulling and pushing.

The two config settings `annex-ignore` and
`annex-sync` are the non-dynamic ways to control this. 
So perhaps the way that annex-cost-command is the dynamic form of
annex-cost, there ought to be annex-ignore-command and annex-sync-command.

That also allows for situations like a network where you want git-annex
sync to only push the git repository but not annexed contents.
