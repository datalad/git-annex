Cost settings only affect sort order, they don't allow completely blocking
use of a remote.

I feel that it would be perhaps the wrong design to extend cost settings
into blocking a remote.

There's also the `remote.<name>.annex-start-command` hook. However,
failure to run its command does not prevent git-annex from trying to access
a remote.

I think it would be reasonable to add a hook
`remote.<name>.annex-check-command`. If set, the command would have
to succed, or git-annex would refuse to use the remote.
