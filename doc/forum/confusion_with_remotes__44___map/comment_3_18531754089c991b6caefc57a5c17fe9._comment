No extra remotes (that I'm aware of); that output was only edited to change hostnames.

On all three hosts, \"git push origin\" and \"git pull origin\" say everything is up to date.

I'm using git-annex 3.20111011 on all hosts (although some were running 3.20110928 when I created the repositories).

Regarding the multiple links, I've put a copy of the dot file [here](http://jim.sh/~jim/tmp/map.dot).
It shows psychosis in three separate subgraphs, that are just getting rendered together as one,
if that helps clarify anything.

Wait, I just realized you said \"the git-annex branch\".  My origin only has \"master\".
Do you mean the one specifically named \"git-annex\"?  I thought that was something that
gets managed automatically, or is it something I need to manually check out and deal with?

Any other info I could provide?
