Trying to add a Backblaze b2 special remote using rclone. 

Have tested the remote using rclone so I know it is set up properly and connecting. 

Running 

    git annex initremote remotename type=rclone encryption=none rcloneremotename=remotename

to initiate the remote in git-annex. 


It fails with: 

    initremote remotename
    git-annex: this rclone remote does not support empty directories
    failed
    initremote: 1 failed

Can not figure out what that means, searching does not help. What have I missed?
