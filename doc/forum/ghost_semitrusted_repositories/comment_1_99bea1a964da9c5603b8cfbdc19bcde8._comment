This is the git remote you currently have set up.

    d4456c86-fa2b-43a7-a132-027915390cf6 -- usb_papers

This is the old remote from before.

Take a look at the repository in the USB drive, and see what its annex.uuid is set to. git-annex doesn't change the UUID after a repository is set up, so the fact that you have two different UUIDs is puzzling. 

If you really wanted to, you could remove the old repository from the list by running: `git annex dead d4456c86-fa2b-43a7-a132-027915390cf6`  
But I would want to get to the bottom of what happened before doing that.
