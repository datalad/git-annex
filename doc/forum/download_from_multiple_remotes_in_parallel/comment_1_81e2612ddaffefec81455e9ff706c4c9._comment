Currently the way to do this to run two git-annex get's in parallel, one
--from A and the other --from B. They will avoid stepping on each other's
toes.

-J2 does not currently accomplish this; git-annex always defaults to
using the remote with the lowest cost. It might be a nice improvement to
have get round-robin when multiple remotes of the same cost contain files.
