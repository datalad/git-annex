Sorry for the delayed response.  I am in the middle of an apartment move.

I tried changing my default PDF viewer to Skim to see if that improved anything.  Nada.  Same thing.  Finder opens the terminal and outputs a bunch of nonsense.  

I tried `git annex migrate --backend=SHA256E` and it seemed to really improve things from finders point of view.  Still not icon previews, but you can launch every file by double clicking it and preview is able to follow the symlink.  

Note, I am on OS X 10.6.  I cant upgrade to 10.7+ due to my laptops aging processor (10.7+ requires 64-bit intel chips) and thus can't test git-annex on a more modern OS version.  Someone should test it out on a newer version of OS X before chaining any defaults, however, it seems to really improve things for the setup I have.
