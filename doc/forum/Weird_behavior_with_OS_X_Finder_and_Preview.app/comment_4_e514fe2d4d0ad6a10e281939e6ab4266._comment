I see a migration to SHA256E currently outputs:

migrate issue.txt (checksum...) (Recording state in git...)
ok

Is that verifying the existing checksum or re-computing it to re-name the file?  If the latter, couldn't the SHA256 to SHA256E migration just rename the file?

I would be worried about this process hiding data corruption.. If it isn't using the old checksum but instead re-computing a new one then it would be easy to miss the fact that a files checksum changed during this process.
