I have a music repository(direct mode) in my Nexus 5 which I want to sync with remote repository(indirect mode).

When I run 'git annex sync --content', it did not sync the content but when I changed remote repository to direct mode, content got synced.

Do I need to set some configuration ?
Is it possible to sync content between direct and indirect mode repositories ?
