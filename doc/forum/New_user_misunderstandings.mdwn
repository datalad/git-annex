New user? Can't figure out the basics? Add it here - what you wanted, what you tried.

#### I wanted to keep track of some files I had all organized in a directory outside of my ~/annex:

    $ cd ~/annex
    $ git annex add /path/to/some/photos
    fatal: '/path/to/some/photos' is outside repository

 But git-annex doesn't work that way. I had to do this instead

    $ rsync -a /path/to/some/photos
    $ git annex add photos
    (Recording state in git...)
    $ git annex status
    ... lots of helpful info...

#### I just have the OS/X app, can I do commandline stuff?

yes

    $ /Applications/git-annex.app/Contents/MacOS/git-annex add photos/
    (Recording state in git...)

but perhaps there is a better way.
