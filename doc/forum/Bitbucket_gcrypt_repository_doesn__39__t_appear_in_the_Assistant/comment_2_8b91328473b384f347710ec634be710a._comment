Unfortunately the Assistant doesn't sync to the https gcrypt repository at all! E.g. if I add a file, the file gets added to the other repositories (the Assistant syncs it in the background) but it doesn't get added to Bitbucket (https gcrypt).
I know that because Bitbucket tells me when the latest change has been made; I can see that no change is reported unless I perform 'git-annex sync' manually.
