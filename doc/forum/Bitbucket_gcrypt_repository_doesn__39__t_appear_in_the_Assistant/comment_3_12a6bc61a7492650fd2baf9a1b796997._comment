Well, the file is not uploaded to the bitbucket remote, because bitbucket
doesn't support git-annex. Without git-annex-shell on the remote, git-annex
cannot send files to it.

Even if it did, it would need to be a ssh
transport, not a http transport, since git-annex doesn't upload files over
http (except to S3 or webdav remotes).

I think that the assistant also assumes that http transport git remotes are
read-only, and doesn't try to push to them. Which might be improvable,
perhaps.
