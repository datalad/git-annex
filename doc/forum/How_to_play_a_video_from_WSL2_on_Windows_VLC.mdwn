I was trying to check out the videos in the downloads repository associated with this project, but I don't know how to get them to play.

In WSL2, I ran:

```
git clone https://downloads.kitenet.net/.git
cd downloads.kitenet.net
git annex get ./videos/git-annex/git-annex-assistant-intro.mp4
```

The download was successful, but trying to play the video using VLC on Windows resulted in the following error:

```
VLC is unable to open the MRL 'file://wsl.localhost/Ubuntu-20.04/home/username/annex/downloads.kitenet.net/videos/git-annex/git-annex-assistant-intro.mp4'.
```

I suppose this is because VLC doesn't know what to do with the symlink, but I don't know how to deal with the problem.
