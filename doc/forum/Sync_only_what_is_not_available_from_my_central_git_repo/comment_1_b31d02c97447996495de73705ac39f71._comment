> If I leave from a meeting or brainstorming session without having pushed all of my work into the cloud then I cannot continue working from home. This is because our office is behind multiple levels of NAT over which we have no control. Hence I am unable to remote into my machine in order to push work up to GitHub or scp it to my laptop.

This is not a git-annex solution, but you could use Pagekite to SSH to your work machine from home.
