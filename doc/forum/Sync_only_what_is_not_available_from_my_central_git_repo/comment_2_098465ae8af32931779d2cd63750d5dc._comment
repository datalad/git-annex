It seems to me that simply running `git annex sync --content` before you go home would do what you need. Have you tried using git-annex? 

Some of the things you're saying don't entirely make sense to me, and so I suspect you're perhaps worrying about problems that don't exist, or that git-annex deals with nicely.
