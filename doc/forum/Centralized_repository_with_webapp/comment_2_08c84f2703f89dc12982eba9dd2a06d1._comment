Hi Joey,

My problem isn't that the repositories don't sync immediately, they are never up at the same time and I understand that the assistant is not constantly checking for changes, so that's not an issue.
The problem is that with this setup I'm experiencing data loss (files being completely removed from both repos), it has happened a few times, but I cant seam to reproduce it reliably. I'll keep investigating and get back to you if I have a proper bug.
