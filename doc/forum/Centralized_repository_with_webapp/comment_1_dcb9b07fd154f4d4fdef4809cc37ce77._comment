Your setup is fine as far as it goes. The problem is that a client has no way to know when another client has pushed a change to the centralized repository. It might take quite a while before it decides on its own to go pull changes from there (most often because *it* has now changed a file, and realizes it needs to sync), and so it won't see files the other client has added right away.

The solution to this is to go to Configuration -> Jabber account, and set both clients up using the same Jabber account. (Or, if these two machines belong to different people, you can pick \"pair with a friend\" to link one with the other over Jabber.)

Now when one client pushes to the centralized repository, it will immediately send the other a message letting it know something has changed.

The webapp actually pops up an alert when you add that centralized ssh repository, to nudge you to do this:

I'm trying to find ways to make the need to do this more clear...
