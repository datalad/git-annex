I had the same problem an got Lightroom to work nicely with the following configuration.

Place catalog and photo data in the same directory tree, for example:


    /Lightroom/2015/2015-01-10/IMG_4432.JPG
    /Lightroom/2015/2015-01-10/IMG_4433.JPG
    ...
    /Lightroom/Catalog/Lightroom 5 Catalog.lrcat
    /Lightroom/Catalog/Lightroom 5 Catalog Previews.lrdata
    /Lightroom/Catalog/Backups


Now the image data and Lightroom metadata (= catalog) can be archived at the same time. In order to prevent temporary files and previews to get annexed use the following `.gitignore`:


    */*.lrdata
    Temporary Folder*/
    */Temporary Import Data*/
    *.lock

The downside is that previews will have to get regenerated on other machines which pull this data, but I don't use it to share my Lightroom config across computers but as an archival tool.
