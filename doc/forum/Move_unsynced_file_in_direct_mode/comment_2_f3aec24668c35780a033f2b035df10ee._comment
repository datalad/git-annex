Thanks for tracking down that bug and for clearing up my confusion about `annex.autocommit`, Joey.

I didn't realize `annex.autocommit=true` is only used by `git annex assistant` and `git annex watch`.  I thought that running `git annex sync` with `annex.autocommit=true` would also commit the change.

A few small changes to `git-annex(1)` could clarify:

    sync [remote ...]
         ...
         The sync process involves first committing all local *staged* changes...

    annex.autocommit
       Set to false to prevent git-annex assistant and *git-annex watch* from automatically committing changes to files in the repository.
