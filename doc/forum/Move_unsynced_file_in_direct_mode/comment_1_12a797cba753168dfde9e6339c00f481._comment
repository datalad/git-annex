Well, you can run `git annex assistant` or `git annex watch` and it will automatically notice the moved file and commit it. I think this is what you were trying to do when you set annex.autocommit to true (which is the default so accomplished nothing).

But your example does show a bug: `git annex add` should add the dangling symlink to git in direct mode, as it already does in indirect mode. Fixed in [[!commit 44e7d6e1fe6e13091adbd572f66412e3601df3c5]].
