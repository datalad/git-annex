Are you using v6 mode? I'd have two entirely different sets of anwsers to
all of these questions depending on whether you're using v6 mode or not.

Since you mentioned annex.thin, I'm going to guess v6 mode...

1. `git status` will be slow in v6 mode if files have been dropped or
   git's index has otherwise gotten out of sync. This is the main reason v6
   mode is still considered experiemental. It's being worked on.
2. WORM backend won't help with 1. The only thing WORM is going to speed
   up is avoiding checksumming when adding files. At the cost that two
   versions of a file with the same size and different content can't be
   differentiated.
3. Yes, git config annex.backends WORM would set the WORM backend by default.
   I don't think that WORM is a good fit for your use case though.
4. `git add` is much slower than `git-annex add`, because the former has to run
   git-annex once per file added. Instead, run: `git config annex.addunlocked true`
   and then `git annex add` will add the files unlocked.
5. We could think about making `git annex add` fiddle with directory perms
   to allow replacing a file with the annex symlink. But, what happens
   if it loses power before it can fix the perms back to original mode?
   Etc. Perhaps there's a way to make lftp not remove write perms to start
   with. But I think you're going to need to use unlocked files anyway,
   otherwise lftp mirror is probably going to see the annexed symlink as
   different than the remote file, and replace it.
6. See #4.
7. No, annex.thin does not make anything slower AFAIK.
