views are a somewhat new feature that still needs work, and you will find this question of what to do about a file added while in a view in the todo list [[here|design/metadata]].

Since views are just git branches, you can check out the view branch where you added the file, and it'll still be there. You could merge the branch (probably not a good idea since the filenames are moved around in the view). 

Using `fromkey` will also work, if you have the right key and the content is present in the annex -- I just tested it.
