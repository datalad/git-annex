OK, I could find the commit where I have added the data. I can 'git show' the commit and see the keys. I can also checkout the commit and I can see my data. Now I tried to create symlinks based on the keys I found in the commit, so whats the right way?

    git annex examinekey SHA256E-s1390161393--1dcba6e914ad6a9133d374e3c55fbf9a58f036e64298262692c7f8e7cdb65852.mkv
    SHA256E-s1390161393--1dcba6e914ad6a9133d374e3c55fbf9a58f036e64298262692c7f8e7cdb65852.mkv

    git annex fromkey SHA256E-s1390161393--1dcba6e914ad6a9133d374e3c55fbf9a58f036e64298262692c7f8e7cdb65852.mkv e01.mkv
    git-annex: key (SHA256E-s1390161393--1dcba6e914ad6a9133d374e3c55fbf9a58f036e64298262692c7f8e7cdb65852.mkv) is not present in backend

I am not sure what to do now :-/.
