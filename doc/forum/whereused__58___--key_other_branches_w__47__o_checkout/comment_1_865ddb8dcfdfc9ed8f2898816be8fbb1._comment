The `--historical` flag of `whereused` leads to a wider search,
including of other branches but also other things, like the current
branch's history and the reflog.

I'm guessing you're after more specific control.

If I want to know when a key occurred in a particular branch, I
usually do something like

```
$ git log -p -S $KEY $BRANCH
```

To know whether a particular key is in the *tip* of a particular
branch (or of some subset of branches), one way would be

```
$ git rev-list --objects --no-object-names --no-walk $BRANCH | \
  git annex lookupkey --ref --batch | \
  grep $KEY
```

Perhaps there are more streamlined ways to get to that information,
though.
