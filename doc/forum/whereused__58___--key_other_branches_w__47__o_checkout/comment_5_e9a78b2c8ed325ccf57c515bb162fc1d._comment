It's fine to have multiple unrelated branches in a repository, I don't
think you're doing anything wrong.

Currently --historical stops once it finds one use of the key.
I think you are wanting to find all uses by any of your branches?

Maybe the right option for this use case would be a --branches that
searches each branch for uses of the key and doesn't stop at the first hit.
Perhaps combined with a --refspec= option that takes a wildcard that can be
used to select which branches to search.
