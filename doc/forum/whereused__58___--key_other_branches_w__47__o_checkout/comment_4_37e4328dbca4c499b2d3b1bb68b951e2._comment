Thank you for the offer. I'm a little sheepish about it though.

Because I'm mindful that my, perhaps over ambition, has knock on effects. eg. is what I am doing (with unrelated branches) breaking how unusued detects unused objects?

If that is the case, I'd understand being consistent and not facilitating this hubris.
