Probably the best thing to do is to use `git log --stat` 
to find the commits that were made on the remote that added the conflicting
files. Also find the merge commit that created the variant
files. You can then `git revert` the merge commit, and follow up by `git
revert` the commits that added the conflicting files. This will bring your
working tree back to the state it was in originally.

Alternatively, if your current repo has the contents present for 
the variants of the files you want to keep, while the remote repos contain
the contents of the variants you want to delete, you could use this command
to delete the variants that don't have their contents in the local repo:

	git annex find --include='*.variant-*' --not --in here --print0 | xargs -0 rm
