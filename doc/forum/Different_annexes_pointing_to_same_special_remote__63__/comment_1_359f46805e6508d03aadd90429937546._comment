You're basically right. Additionally, if you use encryption, the keys used on the remote are themselves encrypted and so even the same content will result in different keys.

With this said, it's easy to use a subdirectory of a rsync or box.com remote, and I'd rather recommend doing that, rather than jumbling multiple repositories data into a single directory.
