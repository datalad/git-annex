Hello,

I have two git annex repos, AA and BB in direct mode. Both have edited a binary file before syncing

```
~/Desktop/BB (git)-[annex/direct/master] % git annex sync

```
How can I resolve this conflict now? Is there a way to tell which bin1 / bin2 is from AA, which from BB? Is there a way to tell git annex to completely take the data from AA or BB?

This case might appear somehow artifical but I was caught in that various times when syncing my music database. Actually I didn't care which version of the database it took, but I was unable to produce a coherent data set, so that the database files only come from one sync partner.

Thanks,
Florian
