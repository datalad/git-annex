There is never a reason to run "git reset --hard git-annex"! For that matter,
don't mess with the git-annex branch if you have not read and understand
the [[internals]] documentation. Even if you have, it's entirely the wrong
thing to be messing with in this situation. It has nothing at all to do
with your problem, except that after running that completely random reset
command, you now have two problems..

The right answer to your interrupted add is something like:

* `git reset --hard master`
* Or, run the `git-annex add` command again and let it resume
* Or, run `git commit` to commit any changes the add made,
  followed by `git annex unannex` to back out adding those files.

Or, if this is an entirely new git repo that you have
never committed to before 
(my guess based on the "bad default revision 'HEAD'"),
just `rm -rf .git` and start over.
