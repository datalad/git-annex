It protects against adding in corrupted files without noticing.

If I move the symlink as a real file, the receiving git-annex will rehash it and, if it is corrupted, effectively change the symlink to a corrupt file with no way to tell this has occured.

This method leaves the transplanted symlink broken (and may be fixed by a reinject of a good copy of the file from another drive) and the corrupt content would be left behind by the reinject. This makes it very obvious something has happened.

Thank you for making these changes to support my use case. I really hope it doesn't break anyone else's!
