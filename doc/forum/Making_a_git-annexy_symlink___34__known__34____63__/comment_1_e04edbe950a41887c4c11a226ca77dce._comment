fsck sees that the (lack of) location
log accurately states that the content is not present, and so avoids
writing to the log.

If fsck always wrote to the log when content was not present, running
fsck in sparse repos would bloat the location logs unncessarily.

But I suppose that it makes sense for fsck to notice that the key
was not known and write to the log in this particular case.
I've gone ahead and made that change.

It's not clear to me though, why this workflow of copying over symlinks,
and adding them and reinjecting is better than just moving over content and
adding it.
