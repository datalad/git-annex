*Laughing* I wish the data collection was interesting.  Just a machine with locked down networking so that it's a tad more secure.  Closest example is an EC2 instance sitting in a VPC...</br> 
&lt;/ASIDE&gt;

Thanks for the feedback Joey.  I tried again and this approach works **except** where the downstream repo is direct mode - in this case the transfer repo doesn't drop.  I'm not sure if it's a bug or a feature I didn't read about.

Happy to submit a bug report with steps if it's unexpected.
