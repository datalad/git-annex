This deduplication is generally considered a feature.
(If you don't want it, you can eg use the WORM backend.)

The `git annex unused` command can be used in this case. It looks through
all files (in all branches) in the repo and finds content that no files
are using, which can then be dropped.

So the question is, if you've been using `git annex drop` before deleting a
file, how do you know when you need to not do that, and 
instead use `git annex unused` after deleting a file? Well, my suggestion
is to just never get in the habit of `git annex drop` before deleting a
file. Reserve using `git annex drop` for times when you are getting low on
disk space and need to free some up by dropping content from local
storage; don't try to manually manage which content is stored in the local
repository as long as you have enough free disk space.
