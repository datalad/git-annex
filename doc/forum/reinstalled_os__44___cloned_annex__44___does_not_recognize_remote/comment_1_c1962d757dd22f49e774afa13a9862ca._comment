It might help if you pasted the actual error message that git-annex shows when you try to use this remote. Along with the part of .git/config that configures this remote.

In general, git-annex does not are if you've reinstalled your OS, moved things around, etc. As long as the git remote's path points to a repository, git-annex will see it and be able to use it.
