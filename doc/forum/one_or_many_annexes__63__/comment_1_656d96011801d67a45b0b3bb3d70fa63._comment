That's an interesting question. Personally, I have two annexes. One for my \"digital library\": movies, music, ebooks, downloads, everything I want to keep but was not created by me. I don't want to loose them because getting them back would be expensive and cumbersome. The other is my personal archive for Photos and Videos I've taken, which are valuable as they contain many memories which would be impossible to recreate if lost. With the first one, I'm experimenting quite a lot, with the second one I'm very conservative. Hope that helps.
