I had to change the checkpresent hook to:

	hogneygmail-checkpresent-hook = (imaputils.pl --subject $ANNEX_KEY --count | grep -q \\"1 messages\\" -) && echo $ANNEX_KEY || exit 0

Also, i have 5 files more than 30MB in size, that refuse to transfer.

 postdrop: warning: uid=1001: File too large
 sendmail: fatal: tou(1001): message file too big
 Error sending message, child exited 75 (Deferred.).
 Could not send the message.

  store hook exited nonzero!
 failed

This really needs some split operations to support large files.
