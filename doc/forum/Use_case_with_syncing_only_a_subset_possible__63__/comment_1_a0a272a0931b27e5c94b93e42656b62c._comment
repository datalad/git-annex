I guess you might be using the git-annex assistant. If you were just using git-annex at the command line, you could simply only run `git annex get` on the files or directories you wanted to get.

You can control which directories the git-annex assistant downloads/uploads files for using [[preferred_content]] expressions. Or the easy solution is to use the webapp to put the repository into \"manual mode\" and then manually run `git annex get` as described above to get just the files you want. (And `git annex copy --to remote` to share new files you make.)
