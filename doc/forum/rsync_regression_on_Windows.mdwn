I'm on Windows 7 and msysgit. The rsync that comes with the git-annex installer downloaded on January 19 2015 works fine (rsync version 3.0.9, protocol version 30; git annex version 5.20150113-gcf247cf). The rsync that comes with the current git-annex installer errors out (rsync version 3.1.1  protocol version 31; git annex v ersion 5.20150420-gb0ebb23). I don't think it's a version/protocol mismatch, as I get the error against a server with the same version and protocol.

[[!format sh """
$ rsync -rvvp anton@myhost:wtmp/ wtmp
opening connection using: ssh -l anton myhost rsync --server --sender -vv
pre.iLsfx . wtmp/  (10 args)

Bug or user error?
