> I am interested in using git-annex to manage git repositories, and I am wondering if it is possible and if anyone has experience with it?

That is not what git-annex is for. git-annex adds large file support to git.

> I have done some searching, and I know that many people have asked for support for a Dropbox-like workflow, where Git repositories are mirrored everywhere. 

The git-annex assistant will automatically sync your files for you. It is similar to dropbox but not entirely the same.

> I also know that no such support seems forthcoming, however this is not my goal. 

I don't know what would give you that idea, the git-annex assistant has already been released.

> Rather, I would like to use git-annex to track the location of many repositories. I keep a lot of repositories and would like to offload them onto other storage devices and keep track of where each repository is stored.

git-annex is not the right tool for that. Maybe you want something like myrepos, which is always written by Joey.

> Perhaps entire Git repositories can be added as a single unit for tracking in git-annex?

Seems unlikely as it is out of scope for git-annex.
