`git annex drop` removes the file's content from the local repository.
It does not affect other repositories, such as in your case the server.
You could use `git annex drop --from origin` to remove the file from
the origin repository.

If `git annex unused` is not listing the deleted file as unused, there
must be some git tag or branch that still refers to it.

Also, `git annex dropunused` won't remove the last copy of a file unless you pass
`--force`
