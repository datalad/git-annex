git annex drop can only drop files that the local repository knows about.
Perhaps you forgot to update your local repo (eg with `git annex sync`) so
it didn't know about the files in the remote and so couldn't drop them.

Of course, git annex drop also will refuse to drop a file from a repository
if that not preserve the required number of copies of the file. It will
tell you if this is the case.

You need to post more details. I can assure you that git annex drop drops
content from a repository.
