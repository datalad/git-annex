I notice you also filed the bug report
[[bugs/Unable_to_take_transfer_lock]], where you said something about having
copied the repository over SMB using `cp` and some kind of OSX copy and
paste. 

So, if you did that, it seems likely that you have 2 git repositories with
the same annex.uuid setting. In fact this is confirmed by [another bug
report](http://git-annex.branchable.com/bugs/remote_repo_marked_as___34__here__34__/) you filed.

Since git-annex expects each repository to have a unique annex.uuid, this is
going to confuse it badly. Don't do that. Use `git clone` to make a clone of
a git repository.
