I have an external HDD which I setup as a remote manually before I started using the assistant.  When I plug it in files sync fine and the git-annex branch gets synced, but the master branch doesn't; git annex sync doesn't do the job and I have to run git pull.  This is annoying because it means that portable drive is useless as a backup, since it doesn't have the required metadata; I have to manually git pull to make it a useful backup.  How can I make the assistant sync the metadata in--if not the master branch, at least origin/master so I could merge later without the remote available.  Thanks.
