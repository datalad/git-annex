Well, I suppose this is doable, but the way this scenario is generally handled is to make a transfer repository (which your desktop is serving as here) have a preferred content expression that makes it want files that the client repositories (phones) want, until the files have reached the clients:

In your case you could have:

    (not inallgroup=phones and ($phone_preferred_content)) or ($desktop_preferred_content)

Where `$desktop_preferred_content` is whatever files the desktop actually wants on its own, and `$phone_preferred_content` is a copy of the preferred content setting for the phone.

To make this work, you also need to put your phone in the phones group.
