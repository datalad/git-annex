I agree with the fact that it answers my initial question.

Nevertheless, I guess it is really annoying to have to change the preferred content in two locations each time I change want to modify what is on my phone.
Indeed, I quite often change what should be really present on my phone, depending on several factors (my mood, the time I will have in transports and the phase of the moon).

The reason why I use \"git annex wanted\" is that it is straightforward: I just launch : \"git annex wanted phone include=some/file\" and that's all.

With the solution you propose, I would have to each time additionally launch \"git annex wanted here '(not inallgroup=phones and (include=some/file)) or ($desktop_preferred_content)'\"

Where I probably have to previously launch \"git annex wanted here\" to remember what is the preferred content of my computer (and put it in $desktop_preferred_content).

Another option would be to run \"git annex vicfg\" and edit both fields manually, but IMHO this appears also to be too complicated relatively to the use case.

About your second comment, I really enjoy the idea if \"git annex sync --content\", but it is really long in big repositories. I guess it is because I cannot restrict the command to a directory like I do with get, drop, move and copy.

Besides, the use case wants to get the files whenever they are and copy them only to the phone. With git annex sync --content, the files are also put in the other repositories.

For the time being, I prefer falling back to explicit commands that are much faster when I know a directory to sync \"git annex get --auto directory && git annex copy --auto --to phone directory\".

For example, I just tried \"git annex sync --content phone\" and I killed it after 5 minutes and nothing was copied yet. With the set of two commands above, the synchronization of directory (get --to phone directory + drop --from here directory) took about 3 minutes.
