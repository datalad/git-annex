I have configured git-annex on my Nexus 5. Even though it works fantastic, it shows some warning messages.

1: 'git-annex sync' :  WARNING: linker: git-annex has text relocations. This is wasting memory and is a security risk. Please fix.

2: 'git log': error: cannot run less. No such file or directory.

Both the commands will work has expected with these warnings. What could be the issue here.
