My attempt to redo the podcast repository adding the `--fast` flag seems to be successful. Thank you.

However, I would still like to ask you one thing about the delete operations.
When would you use `git rm` instead of `git-annex drop` (in a repository that uses only git-annex to store the files)?

Oh, and I'll also sneak in a small question that is unrelated to the above, since I don't think it deserves its own topic:
Is git-annex safe to operate in parallel tasks? Can I be adding file A and move file B and rename file C from the same repository at the same time, without the integrity of the repository being compromised?
