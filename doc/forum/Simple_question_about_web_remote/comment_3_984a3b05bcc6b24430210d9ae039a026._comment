The checksum is not coming from the RSS feed. If you ran `git-annex
importfeed` without `--fast`, it downloaded the content and checksummed it
locally, and this checksum becomes the one it expects to have when
downloading the file again. If you ran `git annex importfeed` with `--fast`, 
it doesn't get a checksum, but it does record the current size of the file
as reported by the web server. 

Either the size or the checksum changing could be what caused the
verification problem. It's possible that the web server reports a bogus
size somehow (I've seen this happen before), or the web server might
be some kind of CDN that is serving up different file contents at
different times for whatever reason.

If you use `git rm` or commit a `rm`, then any content of the file is
retained in the git-annex repository, at least until you use `git annex
unused` to remove it. You can check out old versions of the branch and the
file content will still be there.

If you use `git annex drop`, it drops the content from the local
repository. git-annex still knows about the file, and `git annex get` can
get the content again, perhaps by downloading it from the web again.

Since git-annex still knows about the file even if it's removed or dropped,
`git annex importfeed` avoids re-importing such files from a rss feed.
