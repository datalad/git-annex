The web remote is automatically available (so long as you have an internet
connection) and does not need any configuration to use.

What's going on here is, after git-annex downloads a file from the web
remote, as from any remote, it verifies its checksum. Seems that the
checksum of the content at an url on the web has changed. So, git-annex
rejects the bad data.

(Note that git-annex only started verifying checksums of downloads in
version 5.20151019.)

Now, sometimes you don't care if eg, a podcast file might get modified
after `git-annex importfeed` initially adds it, and you want to just
download whatever file is on the web now, and treat any contents coming
from the web at different times as equivilant.

The way to do that is to use --relaxed when running git-annex addurl or
importfeed.
