When trying to change a remote to the new rclone special remote (from `type=external externaltype=rclone`), I encountered this:

```
$ git annex enableremote halde-pcloud type=rclone 
enableremote halde-pcloud 
git-annex: getRemoteConfigValue externaltype found value of unexpected type PassedThrough. This is a bug in git-annex!
CallStack (from HasCallStack):
  error, called at ./Annex/SpecialRemote/Config.hs:192:28 in main:Annex.SpecialRemote.Config
  getRemoteConfigValue, called at ./Remote/External.hs:920:35 in main:Remote.External
failed
enableremote: 1 failed
```

(The reason I tried it this way is that I didn't want to lose the encrypted files (`encryption=shared`))
