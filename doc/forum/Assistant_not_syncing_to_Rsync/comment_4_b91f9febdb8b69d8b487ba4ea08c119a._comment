Sorry for lack of extra information: The sizes of the remote folder is still at 21MB, well below even the size of the PDF I posted about (that's about 75MB). Copy claims to work, but I see no network use and the remote repo doesn't grow. I install using cabal on my max yesterday, git-annex version: 3.20130107
