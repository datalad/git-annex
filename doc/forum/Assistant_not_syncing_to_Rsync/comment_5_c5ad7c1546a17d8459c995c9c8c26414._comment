Ok, so copy is checking if the file is present, and it seems to think it is, so doesn't try again to send it.

Here's what you need to do: Run `git annex copy FrenchBasicCourserevised-Volume1-StudentText.pdf  --to Womb_MacDocuments --debug`

It'll output something like this:

    copy new (checking rsync...) [2013-01-10 14:51:43 JEST] read: rsync [\"localhost:/tmp/r/f87/4d5/'SHA256E-s0--e3b0c44298fc1c149afbf4c8996fb92427ae41e4649b934ca495991b7852b855/SHA256E-s0--e3b0c44298fc1c149afbf4c8996fb92427ae41e4649b934ca495991b7852b855'\"]

Now try running that command at the shell, and check its exit status. For the above, I ran:

    rsync \"localhost:/tmp/r/f87/4d5/'SHA256E-s0--e3b0c44298fc1c149afbf4c8996fb92427ae41e4649b934ca495991b7852b855/SHA256E-s0--e3b0c44298fc1c149afbf4c8996fb92427ae41e4649b934ca495991b7852b855'\"; echo $?

It output:

    -rw-r--r--           0 2013/01/10 14:51:40 SHA256E-s0--e3b0c44298fc1c149afbf4c8996fb92427ae41e4649b934ca495991b7852b855
    0

Compare with the same command but with the filename mangled. 

    rsync: link_stat \"/tmp/r/f87/4d5/'SHA256E-s0--e3b0c44298fc1c149afbf4c8996fb92427ae41e4649b934ca495991b7852b855/mangled'\" failed: No such file or directory (2)
    rsync error: some files/attrs were not transferred (see previous errors) (code 23) at main.c(1536) [Receiver=3.0.9]
    27

It seems that rsync might be exiting 0 for content that's not there, in your case. This test will confirm or disprove that hypothesis and might provide some useful debug info.
