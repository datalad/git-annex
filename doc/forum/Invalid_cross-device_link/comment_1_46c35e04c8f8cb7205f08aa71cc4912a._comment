I do this all the time (most recently 12 hours ago), and have never seen
this problem. At least not in recent memory.

You didn't say which version of git-annex you are using. Perhaps you
need to upgrade from some old and broken version...

Looking at the current code, it first tries a rename, and if that
fails for a reason such as the two locations being on different devices,
it falls back to using `cp`.
