I've noticed how, when files are synchronized/transferred from one repository (annex?) to another by the assistant, the files in the «remote» repository do no retain the modification time of the original files.
From what I know git does not save file-specific metadata (ownership/timestamps/etc.).
Since I've just started using git-annex, and I'd very much like for backup copies to retain the mtime of the originals, I would like to ask whether I am experiencing a malfunction or whether this is expected behaviour.

Regards
