I am looking to add a uri of files on my institution's HPC cluster to my local git annex with the git annex addurl command. I am able to get transfers over http working, but want to know if other protocols such as sftp or rsync are also available.
What is your advice for accessing files from HPC systems for which the files are not in a remote annex (due to other limitations).
