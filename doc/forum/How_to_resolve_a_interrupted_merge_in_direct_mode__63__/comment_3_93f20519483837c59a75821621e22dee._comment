AFAICS, git-merge was still running when you ctrl-c'd it. So this is coming before git-annex processes the merge to update the work tree.

I don't know why it would take so long to run, especially if it was not using CPU or disk. You might try to reproduce the problem, passing --debug to git-annex, and perhaps strace the git-merge process to see what it's doing.
