Thanks a lot **joey** for your help.

I gave it another try without setting the metadata and by using v4 index.

Instead of directly adding all files to the gateway repository, I distributed the files equally across the 16 nodes to make use of their resources.
On each node I added the file portion to a git-annex repository in order to merge them later via the gateway repository.
Adding the files on each node worked very well using the `--jobs=\"cpus\"` flag.

However, once I tried to merge all 16 repos using `git-annex sync --no-content --allow-unrelated-histories --jobs=\"cpus\"` all of the nodes crashed due to out-of-memory during this step:

`remote: (merging synced/git-annex bigserver/git-annex into git-annex...)`

I assume that you are right and that I simply have too many files.

Unfortunately, I currently cannot spend more time on investigating the issues.
Thanks again for your help. :)
