I have some additional information that may be helpful.  I had git-annex syncing my Mac with a Debian system.  It appears that at some point in time the Debian system's NFS connection disconnected and then may have reconnected with sshfs.  I don't know if this happened when the syncing issue occurred or not and I can't validate that since the machine was rebooted but it is possible that that caused git-annex on the Mac to choke while syncing and create the phantom symlink.  I am experiencing NFS issues at the moment so it may have contributed to this hiccup.
