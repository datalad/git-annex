It sounds like the contents of the files are being successfully transferred.

It may be that you're using an old and buggy version of git-annex, in which the direct mode code lost track of things and so failed to update the tree correctly when receiving the content of a file. If so, you could fix it by upgrading git-annex and running `git annex fsck`.
