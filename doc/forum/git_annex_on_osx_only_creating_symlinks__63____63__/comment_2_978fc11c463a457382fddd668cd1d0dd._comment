I was using the 2013-12-13 build and now I've upgrade to the 2014-01-03 build.  git-annex has symlinked some important workspace.xml files to nowhere.  One looks like this:

workspace.xml -> ../../../.git/annex/objects/M2/8W/SHA256E-s68106--90e9cc4f617c9034db1bf462d058b82c59ade0be58de1d3a3e2f8c02606631c2.xml/SHA256E-s68106--90e9cc4f617c9034db1bf462d058b82c59ade0be58de1d3a3e2f8c02606631c2.xml

The referenced file doesn't exist.  Actually, that entire M2 directory doesn't exist.

This has cost me a lot of time trying to fix this.  I tried git-annex fsck and I get this message:

 ** No known copies exist of XXXXXXX/workspace.xml

\"XXXXXXX\" is a path I needed to obscure

I can see it in the git-annex repo but it is a reference to a symlink that doesn't exist.  Is there any way to get this file back?  git-annex whereis tells me it is nowhere.  This appears to be real data loss.
