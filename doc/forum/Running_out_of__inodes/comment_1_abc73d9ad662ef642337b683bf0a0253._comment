Define \"huge\"? Checking out a git repository necessarily requires one inode per file in the repository, plus a smaller quantity for the things in .git. A git-annex repository  is much the same as any other git repository.

Even when I make a really tiny 100 mb ext4 filesystem, it defaults to 25000 inodes, which would be enough to contain a checkout of my second largest git-annex repository. 

Anyway, using git branches seems like a reasonable workaround, to the extent I understand your problem. Make a branch with the files in it you want to have available on the small drive, or check out an empty branch on the small drive and `git annex add` files in there. You can merge the branch back into your master branch on the large drive.
