I have large central repositories of data. Therefore, on each client I want to save part data(to save space of disk). In command line I do 

	[...]
	git-annex webapp
	git-annex drop [DeleteContentDirectory]
	[...]

After this command Assistant performs automatic synchronization getting content of files from this directory(DeleteContentDirectory), but I don't want. I want it's was only symlink of file in this directory.

How can I configure Assistant which files have to get content on the client?  It's possible?
