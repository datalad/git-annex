I would like to get available the access to the annex of my repository as remote with rsync protocol (read only).
The idea is not to have a redundant copy of the annex but to add an other option to connect to the annex.

If I create an rsync remote I obtain something like

	00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001 -- web<br/>

 	00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000002 -- bit torrent

 	044cf7ac-d2b1-4f84-8bbc-747ac4659c8f -- rsync

 	a0e14705-ef07-4b8a-9a00-8724fd936a91 -- origin /my-repo/.git/annex

The remote "rsync" points to the same location of the annex /my-repo/.git/annex

If I add a file

 	git annex add file1

and then I check where it is available

 	git annex whereis file 1

I obtain that it is not available on 'rsync'

Therefore if someone has a copy of the repository, without access to the origin annex,
there is no way to use the additional access through 'rsync'

What is the right way to configure the 'rsync' remote in such a way behave like an alias for the origin annex?
