great, thanks for the feedback!

i agree that 25ms is quite fast to fire up a 52MB binary. :) i am just saying that if this is going to end up as part of building a webpage, i need something faster, or cache the results somewhere.

duly noted for the other points, thanks again. i see a great intimate relationship building between `git cat-file` and me. ;)
