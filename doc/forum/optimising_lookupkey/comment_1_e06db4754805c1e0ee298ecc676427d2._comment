Yes, that's the same, except lookupkey only operates on files that are
checked into git.

(Also, lookupkey will work in a direct mode repo, while such a repo
may not have a symlink to examine.)

25ms doesn't seem bad for a "whole runtime" to fire up. :) I think most of
the overhead probably involves reading the git config and running
git-ls-files.

Note that lookupkey can be passed a whole set of files, so you could avoid
the startup overhead that way too.
