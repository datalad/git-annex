That's right, bup can store multiple versions of a file as efficiently as
git itself can (or maybe a little more).

You can use [bup as a special remote of git-annex](https://git-annex.branchable.com/special_remotes/bup/),
and then your backup repository would be a bup repository.
Restoring old versions of files from it would work the same way
I described above.
