While Marco is right about backup repositories, note that the assistant can
only move the content of deleted/old versions of files to a backup repository 
if that repository is set up as a remote of the repository where the
assistant is running.

So, it's quite possible to have some backup repositories that are not well
enough connected for deleted/old files to reach them. The deleted/old files
will then be kept in whatever repositories happen to contain them.

Where are the deleted files stored? Underneath .git/annex/objects/

Also, the webapp has a configuration page to control what to do with unused
files, and can be configured to delete them periodically if you'd prefer.
