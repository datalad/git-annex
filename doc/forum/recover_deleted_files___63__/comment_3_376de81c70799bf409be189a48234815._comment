i think of a kind of \"WORM-library\", so basically just add, not allow to remove content. (at least not for the user thru the mounted device)
- so a script to add/commit -- but as stag-1 check for delete files and get them back. some git magic needed, but should be doable.
- or thru \"samba\" parameters set to add but not delete/overwrite files.  (read yes, write yes, delete no) -- to be proved thats possible, but not your job :) ( annex-ing via cron every /5 or via inotify)
so yea, will play for a while and maybe come back with new. thanks to everybody.
