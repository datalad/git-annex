Git automatically packs loose object files after a while, which includes
git-annex branch files. See `git-gc --help`.

It also delta compresses files, and git-annex's log files will delta
compress and compress pretty well, so your du's of a checked out git-annex
branch don't mean much.

As far as I can tell, your git repository is 118mb in size, including
the git-annex branch and all history.

You can use `git annex forget` to drop historical location tracking
info for files.
