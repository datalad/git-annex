I don't know how to approach this yet, but I support the idea -- it would be great if there was a tool that could punch files out of git history and put them in the annex. (Of course with typical git history rewriting caveats.)

Sounds like it might be enough to add a switch to git-annex that overrides where it considers the top of the git repository to be?
