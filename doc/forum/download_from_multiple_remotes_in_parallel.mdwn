Hey everyone, 

I have the situation that there are two remote repositories A and B, both of which have several files that I want to get. The problem is that both A and B have limited upstream, so launching several threads downloading from A would not speed up the download, but downloading from A and B in parallel would help significantly.

When I git-annex-get these files, my dream would be that specifying --jobs=2 has the effect that thread #1 only downloads from A and thread #2 only downloads from B. If this is the case, great, but if it is not (and I expect it to not be the case), is there any way to get files in parallel from A and B, but only ever having one connection to each of these repositories?

Thanks a lot!
