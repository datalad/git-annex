Ok i finally understand.

I remove the ssh with `git add remove pdfwebfaction` and recreate with

`git remote add pdfwebfaction ssh://reyman@webxxx.webfaction.com:/home/reyman/webdav/pdf`

At this step, `git annex get --from pdfwebfaction` doesn't work, i need to create and add a file like `touch test` to my local empty git repository.

After that, the previous command work.
