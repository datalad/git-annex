Do you mean \"made\"==\"updated\" or made==\"already exists\"?

Maybe I have an old version (installed via brew)...

I get: 

~/s/a/annex8 git:master ❯❯❯ git annex fsck -q
  Bad file size (1 B smaller); moved to .git/annex/bad/<long_hash>
git-annex: fsck: 1 failed

unless there are no other copies, in which case the original filename it is printed on a new line with the \"No known copies\" warning. 

My use-case is for images - a small amount of corruption to some old images might not be visually perceptible, and hence tolerable, especially if I'm short-sighted enough to only have 1 copy. 
I mean its possible for the user to navigate to /bad, visually inspect that they're ok with a corrupted image, parse the git log --stat message and restore it. 
But it seems beneficial to have something like a rsync-like \"--dryrun\" option for fsck.
