So, the procedure that worked for me was:

 1. edit the annex.uuid configuration setting in one of the repositories that had a duplicate

 2. edit the remote.*.annex.uuid configuration setting in all repositories that had the repository edited in (1) as a remote

 3. `git annex fsck` in both repositories that had the duplicate uuidâ€”this is because these repositories did not have correct information as to which files they contained, due to my previous syncing efforts

 4. `git annex sync` till convergence
