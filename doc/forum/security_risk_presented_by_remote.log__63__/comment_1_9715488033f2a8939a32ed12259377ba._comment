it depends how you configured encryption. this is pretty well described in the [[encryption]] page, but basically, unless you used \"shared\" encryption, only the holders of the GPG private key material will be able to decrypt the contents. Objects are encrypted with GPG using a symmetric key, and that key is then encrypted with OpenPGP public keys.

This is all pretty well described in [[encryption]]. --[[anarcat]]
