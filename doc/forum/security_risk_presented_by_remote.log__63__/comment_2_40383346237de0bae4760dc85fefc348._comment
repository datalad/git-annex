I read the encryption page but I just want to know if I'm understanding it correctly.

Let's say I initiated my remote with this command:

    git annex initremote myremote type=S3 chunk=256MiB keyid=XXXXXXXX bucket=mybucket

And then, I handed out my remote.log file to people publicly. Does that expose *any* security hole at all? Or is 100% of the information in remote.log secured using gpg?

I would believe that people couldn't decrypt my file contents, but could they get into my bucket or my S3 account?
