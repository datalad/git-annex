I think you are understanding this correctly... let's see..

It won't expose your S3 credentials, if that's what your are asking. Those are stored in `.git/annex/creds/` and not in the git-annex branch. You can see the content of `remote.log` yourself with:

    git cat-file -p git-annex:remote.log

... if that helps you at all..

>  Or is 100% of the information in remote.log secured using gpg?

Well, it *would* expose the bucket name and the GPG key id (\"XXXXXXXX\") that you set there. The remote.log, itself, is *not* encrypted with gpg, from what I understand. Or to put it another way, the `remote.log` is not actually sent to the S3 remote there, and if you put the git repo publicly, then its content will be publicly readable. To protect against that, you would need a [[special_remotes/gcrypt]] remote.

> I would believe that people couldn't decrypt my file contents, but could they get into my bucket or my S3 account?

Not unless they have the S3 credentials, no. Furthermore, if the bucket is not publicly readable (see [[tips/public_Amazon_S3_remote/]] for that), they won't be able to get the file contents either. And *even* if it is public, they would get the *encrypted* content which they couldn't decrypt without the private key associated with the keyid you supplied.
