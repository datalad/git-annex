Each separate repository needs to have a separate `git annex assistant` process handling it.

Normally, these would all be started when `git annex assistant --autostart` is run, typically when you log into a desktop environment.

So, on Linux, this is done via a .desktop file (or you can arrange for the command to be run as the right user at boot if not using a desktop); on OSX it's done via a .plist file. On Windows and Android, nothing handles the autostarting yet.
