There's a similar setup page for running your own server with a bare git repo: <https://git-annex.branchable.com/tips/centralized_git_repository_tutorial/on_your_own_server/>

However: 

1. the instructions are not specific for a transfer repo and showcasing the git-annex-drop statement 
2. out of date as the instructions don't work.

I also found <https://git-annex.branchable.com/forum/How_to_work_with_transfer_repos_manually63/>. 
But the solution doesn't seem to work here either. 
Maybe something changed since then.
