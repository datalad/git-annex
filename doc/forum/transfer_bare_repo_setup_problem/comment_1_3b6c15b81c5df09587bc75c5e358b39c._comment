Seems like I needed to manually run:

```
cd $DIR/client2
git annex sync --content
```

which solves the file not found issue. Wonder why the git-annex assistant didn't just sync again...

Then, `cat file.txt` still gives `/annex/objects/SHA256E-s14--42e950c34152a022a2ec82b2201a2287689e39d4d97bfcef67f8940b49d25d4b.txt`.

I managed to solve it by running `git-annex restage` on client2.

However, after running `git annex whereis`, I get:

```
whereis file.txt (3 copies) 
  	1d6bad3e-6a1c-4371-af5f-794bf387480c -- kolam@xxx:~/git-annex-scenarios/share-between-clients/share [share]
   	87ba86d9-4922-4a4a-8c8d-57c791e0f80e -- kolam@xxx:~/git-annex-scenarios/share-between-clients/client2 [here]
   	f5b9efb1-e5b3-4573-aa6d-354180193c74 -- kolam@xxx:~/git-annex-scenarios/share-between-clients/client1
ok
```

but I noticed that the assistant doesn't drop the file from the \"share\" repo.

Running `git annex drop --auto --from share`, I get:

```
drop file.txt (from share...) (unsafe) 
  Could only verify the existence of 1 out of 2 necessary copies

  Maybe add some of these git remotes (git remote add ...):
  	f5b9efb1-e5b3-4573-aa6d-354180193c74 -- kolam@nelson:~/git-annex-scenarios/share-between-clients/client1

  (Use --force to override this check, or adjust numcopies.)
failed
drop: 1 failed
```

Of course, that also means that if I modify \"$DIR/client2/file.txt\", the assistant doesn't send the updates to client1. I need to do a manual `git annex sync --content` on `client1`.
Then again, I can't drop the file from \"share\" because of that same error as before.
