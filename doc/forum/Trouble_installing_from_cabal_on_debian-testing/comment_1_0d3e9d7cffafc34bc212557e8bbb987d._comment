The difficulty with using cabal on Debian testing (and unstable) is that Debian has an older version of Yesod, and I have not managed to get cabal to work with both versions at once.

If you build using the Makefile, it currently uses the old version of Yesod, so that'll work.

The [package from unstable](http://packages.debian.org/sid/git-annex) should install ok on testing.
