I am trying to configure the local repo to be connected with remote computer. It can either find this computer on local network using local host name, or go through public IP host where I have ssh tunnel. First confusing thing is, that when setting up remote server, it successfuly establishes connection, but then asks me if the folder should be git or rsync - I believe this step should be skipped if the git repo is already there. Also choosing repository group should be detected from the repo itself.
But the real problem is that I cannot add the public IP repo at all. Is this a known limitation?
