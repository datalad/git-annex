My issue apparently had to do with numcopies? I first passed `--numcopies 2` because I was curious but it didn't change anything. Then I passed `--numcopies 1` and it immediately dropped all the files as I'd have expected it to at `numcopies=3`. Running another sync without `--numcopies` didn't attempt to pull in the dropped files either.

This smells like a bug? If numcopies was actually violated, it should attempt to correct that again, right? (All files were available from a connected repo.)

Here are the numcopies stats from `git annex info .`:

```
numcopies stats: 
	numcopies +1: 1213
	numcopies +0: 25310
```

Some more background: I have a bunch of drives that are offline that I have set to be trusted. One repo on my NAS is online at all times and semitrusted.

I have two offline groups: `cold` and `lukewarm`. All drives in those groups are trusted.

It's weird that it didn't work with 2 but did work with 1. This leads me to believe it could have been due to the one repo being online while the others are offline and trusted; acting more like mincopies. Was behaviour changed in this regard recently?

I'd still like to know how to debug wanted expressions too though.
