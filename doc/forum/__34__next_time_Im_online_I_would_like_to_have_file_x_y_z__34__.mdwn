git-annex is seriously cool, however I havent figured out an important detail:
in the short presentation Richard Hartmann mentions the Nomad use case and says "... next time Im online I would like to have file x y z ... "
How can this be achieved exactly? If I do a git annex copy/get then it will want to do it instantly, not queuing it.
thanks a lot!
