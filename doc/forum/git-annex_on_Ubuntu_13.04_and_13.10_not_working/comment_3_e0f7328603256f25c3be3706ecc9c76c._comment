Your screenshot shows git-annex is in the process of adding 6244 files. Depending on the size of those files, it could take some time to read their contents in order to calculate a checksum and add them to the repository. This would not normally take hours, unless your disk is very slow or the files are extremely big.

You might get some useful information if you enable debugging (Configuration -> Preferences -> Enable debug logging) and look at the log.

(This is not \"syncing\" btw. You have not set up any other repository for it to sync data with.)
