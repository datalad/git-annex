> If you're importing and exporting to the same remote, what happens when there's a conflict? Eg, whatever else is writing files to the remote writes to a file, but you locally modify the same file, and export a tree, without importing the new version first. That would overwrite the modified file on the remote, losing data.

The man page for git-annex-export states that this shouldn't be a problem, or at least shouldn't lead to data loss (might still require manual intervention):

> When a file on a special remote has been modified by software other than git-annex, exporting to it will not overwrite the modified file, and the export will not succeed. You can resolve this conflict by using git annex import.

Maybe this was improved after this forum post happened?

There is probably some potential for issues when exporting and writing with another program _at the same time_, although that might be mitigated with webdav locks, for the webdav case. Also, you state that this is already a problem with the remotes that support export and import now.

Is this concern outdated? I would love to be able to import and export to webdav, so that I could use a Nextcloud as a \"frontend\" to a git-annex repository, getting the \"best of both worlds\" so to speak.
