Hello,

I have my music git annexed, direct mode. It's about 30k files of 429GB size. Some actions take considerable time (sync, add and of course transfer to/from other repos). During this time I don't hear music because of my player changes files. :-(

When is it a problem when a files changes during git annex operations?

git annex get gives a wrong checksum I guess and you need to re-transfer later.

What about git annex add?

Thx!
Florian
