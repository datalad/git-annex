IIRC bup always initializes ~/.bup, even when using a remote repository.

Your mistake is that you have run `git annex initremote` twice -- so now
git-annex knows about two different remotes, which both happen to be backed
by the same bup repository -- but git-annex doesn't know that.

Instead, you should run `git annex initremote` in one repository, and then
use `git annex enableremote` in clones of that repository to enable your
bup remote.

You will probably want to kill off the redundant bup remote with `git annex
dead mybup` and then using `git annex enableremote` to enable the other one.
