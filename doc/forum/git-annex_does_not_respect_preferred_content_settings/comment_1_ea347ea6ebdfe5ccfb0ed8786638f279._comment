Um, I'm pretty sure git-annex respects your preferred content settings.
Whether the settings do what you think they do is another matter.

When I tried replicating the same settings you show, "git annex get --auto"
didn't want to get any files. That makes perfect sense, since
"present" only succeeds if the file is already in the repo, so for files
that are not, it fails, and so "present AND foo" fails, and so the file is
not wanted.

Lose the "present". All you need to make the files land on only 1 of the
PodA repos is "not copies=PodA:1"
