joey thanks for the reply, I've updated the expression to \"not copies=PodA:1\" but running \"git annex get --auto\" still wants to get all files that are already present in other repos in PodA. Say I have file asd.txt present in PodA repo 2 and PodB repo 4 content is already there. running get on repo 1 still gets the file in repo 1.
