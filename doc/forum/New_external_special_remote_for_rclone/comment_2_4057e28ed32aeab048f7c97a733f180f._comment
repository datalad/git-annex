This has now been merged into rclone, but it's not yet shipped in a release. It is now a subcommand of rclone (`rclone gitannex`) rather than a standalone command. When invoked with `-h`, it prints some rough installation instructions, which are also available here: <https://github.com/rclone/rclone/blob/master/cmd/gitannex/gitannex.md>.

As for the concurrent transfers problem, I was told by rclone's maintainer that on backends where partially uploaded files are visible, the backend automatically writes to a temp location and renames when the transfer is complete [[GitHub thread](https://github.com/rclone/rclone/pull/7654#discussion_r1512964399)]. I want to delve into this a little more and do something in `rclone gitannex` when the backend does not have this two-step-transfer property (maybe it should print a warning, or maybe just abort).
