Looking at the docs at
<https://github.com/git-annex-remote-rclone/git-annex-remote-rclone>
there are a lot of options for different directory layouts. Do you have any
plans to support those? It seems it might be useful for migration of
existing special remotes, if nothing else.

I guess that "rcloneprefix=" in this is the same as "prefix="
in git-annex-remote-rclone?

I've added a mention of this to [[special_remotes/rclone]].
