Cool! Do let us know when it's available and we can add it to the list of
special remotes.

WRT the simple export interface, there is a PR on git-annex-remote-rclone
that adds it
<https://github.com/git-annex-remote-rclone/git-annex-remote-rclone/pull/62>.
But, it got hung up on a question of avoiding possible data loss if two
git-annexes are exporting the same file. That sounds like a problem you
will need to consider in your implementation too.
