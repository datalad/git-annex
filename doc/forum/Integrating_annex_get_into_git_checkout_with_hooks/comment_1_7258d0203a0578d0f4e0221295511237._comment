git-annex doesn't set up such hooks, but you can easily make a
post-checkout and/or post-merge hook that runs, eg "git-annex get"

You might also want a pre-push hook that does "git annex copy --to origin"
to make sure they upload their annexed files. 

Or, change workflows to use `git annex sync --content`
