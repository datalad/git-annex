On Android 4.4.4, I can install the most recent git annex. I want to join a git annex running on my linux server. Git annex on android seems to be able to contact remote, and it asks if I want to 'merge' with it. I hope that did not mean erase the remote.  Anyway, the sync says it is proceeding, but when it is done, I cannot find a folder with remote copies of files. 

I figure either it worked, or it destroyed my remote. 

After new install, I have folders /sdcard/annex and /sdcard/git-annex.home. I don't find a new folder with name of remote repo, don't understand why.

Help?
