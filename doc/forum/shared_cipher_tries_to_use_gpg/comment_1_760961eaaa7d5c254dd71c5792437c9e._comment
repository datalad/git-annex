That's the right syntax, and it works when I try it, even if I move my `~/.gnupg` directory away.

You sure you have a new enough git-annex for the shared cipher feature? It appeared in version 3.20120430

You could try passing the `--debug` option to see what it's trying to do with gpg when it fails.
