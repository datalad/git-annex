Iâ€™ve noticed something odd when inspecting the history of the
git-annex branch today. Apparently, the branch had some merge
conflicts during sync that involved two alternative location tracking
entries that both were for one and the same remote. Both entries only
differed in their timestamps, and the union merge kept both, so that I
now have .log files in the annex branch that contain duplicate parts
like this.

<pre>
1404838274.151066s 1 a2401cfd-1f58-4441-a2b3-d9bef06220ad
1406978406.24838s 1 a2401cfd-1f58-4441-a2b3-d9bef06220ad
</pre>

The UUID here is my local repository.

The duplication also occurred in the uuid.log:

<pre>
4316c3dc-5b6d-46eb-b780-948c717b7be5 server timestamp=1404839228.113473s
4316c3dc-5b6d-46eb-b780-948c717b7be5 server timestamp=1404847241.863051s
</pre>

Is this something to be concerned about? The situation somehow arose
in relation to unannexing a bunch of files and rebasing the master
branch.
