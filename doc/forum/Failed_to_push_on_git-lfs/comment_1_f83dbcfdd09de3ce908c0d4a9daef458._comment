This doesn't involve LFS at all, it's a regular git branch being pushed in
the regular way. So you can certianly solve the problem with some
combination of `git pull`, `git merge`, and `git push`.

That said, I don't know why `git-annex sync` didn't work in your situation.
I created some test git-lfs repos on github and never saw any difficulty
syncing with them.
