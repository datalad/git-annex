I set up a new git annex repo with an S3 remote. Uploading small files works file, but the process fails on larger files (>1 GB) with the following error. 

    copy prosper/loaninfo.p (checking s3...) (to s3...) 
    99%          10.7MB/s 0s
    S3Error {s3StatusCode = Status {statusCode = 400, statusMessage = "Bad Request"}, s3ErrorCode = "RequestTimeout", s3ErrorMessage = "Your socket connection to the server was not read from or written to within the timeout period. Idle connections     will be closed.", s3ErrorResource = Nothing, s3ErrorHostId = Just "< a base64 encoded string>", s3ErrorAccessKeyId = Nothing, s3ErrorStringToSign = Nothing, s3ErrorBucket = Nothing, s3ErrorEndpointRaw = Nothing, s3ErrorEndpoint = Nothing}

I tried these different options while setting up remote, but nothing worked.
partsize=1GiB
partsize=400MiB
chunk=100MiB

What am I doing wrong? Should I try an even smaller chunk sie
