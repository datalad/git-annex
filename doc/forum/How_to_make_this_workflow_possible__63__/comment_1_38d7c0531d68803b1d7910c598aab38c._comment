> The one caveat here is `git annex sync --content --no-pull` seems to ignore the no-pull option and tries to redownload all the raw files back to the laptop. How to do a one-way sync (laptop -> remote only with content)?

AFAICT, pull only concerns `git` actions, not `git-annex` actions like transferring content.

What your laptop's repo tries to copy depends on what content it wants and numcopies.  

The latter probably isn't your problem since you should have at least 2 copies of everything distributed over the drives.  
The former should ideally be solved with a proper customised groups setup but you can also set a wanted expression or use the built-in groups which is probably your best option. Your laptop's repo should be set to `client` or `manual`.

See https://git-annex.branchable.com/git-annex-preferred-content/ and https://git-annex.branchable.com/preferred_content/standard_groups/

> XMP sidecars that are produced are tracked in regular git

Have you set `annex.largefiles` to anything? 

Sidecar files are just XML AFAICT, so a filter that would only add files with binary mimeencoding to annex would exclude these and add them to regular git.

If you haven't touched that setting (double check with `git config`), that's a bug.

> Try to sync with any available remote (this is the part I can't seem to figure out. I wish git-annex could be detect and try to to push to all available remotes instead me having to track which remotes are available). 
> `git annex [copy|move]` have the `--to=here` option which will copy/move files from remotes to local repo. It would be exceptionally useful to have a `--to=reachable` option to send files to any reachable remote instead of having to copy/moves to each remote individually.

By default, sync syncs with *all* available remotes. 

How exactly are your repo's remotes set up?

What does it to when syncing that you don't want it to?
