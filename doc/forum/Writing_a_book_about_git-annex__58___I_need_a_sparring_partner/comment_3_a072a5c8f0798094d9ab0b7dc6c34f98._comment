Thanks for your comments. I am very interested in things people build on top of git-annex. I am looking forward to read more about these projects. 

Interesting that both of you don't use the webapp or the assistant. It was the first thing I used and it was disappointing, so now I try out the commandline. 

I understand that managing an amount of files way too big for ones notebook or desktop is one of the main use cases. And this is a use case I definitely will cover in the book, if I write it at all. 

Still evaluating...
