A new `git annex proxy` command was just added that allows safely running commands like `git revert` in a direct mode repsitory.

So, you might do:

    rm myfile # oops!
    git annex sync
    git annex proxy -- git revert HEAD
    git annex get myfile

The sync is needed to commit the deletion, and then that commit gets reverted. Finally, you can use git-annex get to download the file from some other repository that still has a copy. (Assuming you didn't delete the last copy.)
