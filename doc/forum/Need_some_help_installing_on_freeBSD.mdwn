Hi there,

*I'm trying to install git-annex on my NAS which is freeNAS running freeBSD. 
I've created a jail for it and installed via: pkg install hs-git-annex*

I've seen on this page: http://www.freshports.org/devel/hs-git-annex/ that there are Configuration Options. 
I assume to use those I'd have to have compiled it myself from the ports like this: 
To install the port: cd /usr/ports/devel/hs-git-annex/ && make install clean

So in this case of using the pkg, how can I check the way git-annex was compiled? 
Anyone else ever used it on freeBSD and can give some input please? 

*Figured out how to see this info:*

git-annex version
git-annex version: 5.20150727
build flags: Assistant Webapp Webapp-secure Pairing S3 WebDAV Kqueue XMPP DNS Feeds Quvi TDFA Database
key/value backends: SHA256E SHA1E SHA512E SHA224E SHA384E SKEIN256E SKEIN512E MD5E SHA256 SHA1 SHA512 SHA224 SHA384 SKEIN256 SKEIN512 MD5 WORM URL
remote types: git gcrypt S3 bup directory rsync web bittorrent webdav tahoe glacier ddar hook external

*So apparently box.com isn't supported in this build?*

I installed via a web terminal, not via a normal ssh connection so when I came back the installation with all dependencies was finished but I couldn't scroll back to see all warning, only caught this last part of the screen; anyone got any idea if git-annex is supposed to run fine on FreeBSD 9.3-RELEASE-p26 amd64? 

*part of the text I caught:*

You might want to consider increasing the kern.maxfiles tunable if you plan     
to use this library for applications that need to monitor activity of a lot     
of files.                                                                       
                                                                                
If the default on your system is too low, add the following line to             
/boot/loader.conf, then reboot the system:                                      
                                                                                
    kern.maxfiles="25000"
