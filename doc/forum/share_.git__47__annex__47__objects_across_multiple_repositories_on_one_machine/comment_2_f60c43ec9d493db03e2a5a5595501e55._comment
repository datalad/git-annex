Hi, I'm new to git and we might be adopting it on next project solely because of git annex!
As our files are quite big, having users cloning the repository with --shared is very very nice!
We use Linux, so no issue with hardlinks. I did some testing and so far so good. No duplicated space is very very nice!
But I'm wondering: is there any disadvantage on this approach?
