that is a pretty bad idea! :) git-annex will believe it has two copy of the files and could allow you to drop the last copy, and loose data.

instead, you should clone the repo with `--shared`, like this:

    git clone --shared /tmp/repo-clone1 /tmp/repo-clone2

according to the [[git-annex]] manpage, this will set the `annex.hardlink` setting and mark the repo as \"untrusted\". files will be hardlinked between the two repositories, using only the space once.
