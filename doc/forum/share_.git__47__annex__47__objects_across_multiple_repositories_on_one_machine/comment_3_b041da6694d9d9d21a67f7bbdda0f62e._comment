@davicastro using --shared makes git-annex not trust the shared clone, 
which is necessary to avoid situations that could result in data loss.
The downside though, is that the lack of trust can change git-annex
behavior in some situations.

For example, normally you can run `git annex get myfile` and then `git
annex drop myfile --from someremote` will remove it from the remote, since
you now have a local copy. But, with the shared clone being untrusted, the
drop will fail if it would be the only remaining copy of the file. In
this situation, you would need to first `git annex copy myfile --to origin`
or something like that before dropping.

Of course, that copy would run fast and cheap since it only has to make a
hardlink!
