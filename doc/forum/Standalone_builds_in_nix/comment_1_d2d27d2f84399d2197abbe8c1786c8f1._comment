My downloads.kitenet.net repository has limited size and only retains old
builds for a certain amount of time. (There are 200+ gb of old builds at
this point.) So I would recommend making your own
copy of the file, or using the archive.org url which you can find with
git-annex.

(I've only recently gotten uploading to archive.org working again.)
