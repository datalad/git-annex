One thing I do slightly differently is put comments in my ```feeds``` file so I know what feed is what...

    # NPR - Wait Wait... Don't Tell Me!
    http://www.npr.org/rss/podcast.php?id=35
    # NPR - Car Talk
    http://www.npr.org/rss/podcast.php?id=510208


Then I use 

    grep -v '^#' feeds| xargs git-annex importfeed --relaxed

I reckon that makes maintenance easier.
