Thanks Joey for the great work.

I'm using git annex for my tv-shows and movies Folder.

I have 3 USB HDD (ext.150Gb,ext.200Gb, ext.2Tb) and a USB Stick (ATV), which are traveling between 3 Devices

2 Notebooks (Lappi,Kiste) and a Nas.

First of all, I'm made a mistake and mixed the remote Locations from the tvshows folder with the movies folder and did a git annex sync, ( this happened about two weeks ago) 
I think i can't undo this, only unannex will help.

I've now watched the annex status output and noticed that there are many Remotes, some of them have a timestamp as name.
