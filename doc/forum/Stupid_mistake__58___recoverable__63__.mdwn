Hi,

I was a bit hasty the other day and did something stupid.  I
added a new folder to git annex.  Something like

    git annex add my-important folder

my-important folder contains a lot of files and it took a couple
of minutes to add.  When I then tried to do

    git commit -am 'added files'

per the walkthrough I got an error (9, as I recall).  I thought
I'd added too many files or something so I wanted to start over
and perhaps I didn't fully understand the mechanisms of annex I
did the following

    git reset --hard .

Unfortunately, did replaced my files with a bunch of symlinks,
rather than making git annex forget and go back to the previous
stage as I had hoped.

I have managed to recover most of my files from backup, but some
of them I still can't recover.  Is there any way back?  It seems
I still have the files in my git folder.

Thanks,
Rasmus
