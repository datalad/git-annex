The commands would exit successfully.


I realize now that if I wanted to start from scratch the correct thing to do is likely 'git annex uninit' so I am running that now, but it fails often with an error like:

```
git-annex: Users/hiredman/.gem/specs/rubygems.org%80/quick/Marshal.4.8/bundler-1.0.15.gemspec points to annexed content, but is not checked into git.
Perhaps this was left behind by an interrupted git annex add?
Not continuing with uninit; either delete or git annex add the file and retry.
```

So I wrote in little shell loop to run 'git annex uninit', replace symlink with the contents out of .git/, and run 'git annex uinit' again. This is going slowly and seems to be getting slower, so I guess uninit does some kind of scan of all the files that is interrupted every time it hits the above error, and has to be done again from scratch every time, so as I remove those errors one by one uninit takes longer and longer to hit the next error. So what I need to do is write a script to fix the links up in a single scan.
