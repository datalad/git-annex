So, this seems to suggest that `git annex add` exited before it got around
to checking all the files it had added into the git repository.

I don't see how that could happen if the command exited successfully.
If it were interrupted, sure.

Normally I'd recommend that `git annex add` just be re-run to recover from
an interrupted add. But if it's just going to exit for some reason again,
I guess that won't work.

I think you need to strace a git-annex command like `git-annex copy --to S3`
and see if there's some clue why it's exiting unexpectedly.
