hmmmm - I'm still not sure I get this.

If I'm using a whole bunch of distributed annexs with no central repo, then I can not do a `git pull remote` without either specifying the branch to use or changing default tracked remote via `git branch --set-upstream`.  The former like you note doesn't pull the git-annex branch down the latter only works one-at-a-time.

The docs read to me as though I ought to be able to do a `git pull remote ; git annex get .` using anyone of my distributed annexs.

Am I doing something wrong?  Or is the above correct?
