My goal for `git-annex merge` is that users should not need to know about it, so it should not be doing expensive pulls.

I hope that `git annex sync` will grow some useful features to support fully distributed git usage, as being discussed in [[pure_git-annex_only_workflow]]. I still use centralized git to avoid these problems myself.
