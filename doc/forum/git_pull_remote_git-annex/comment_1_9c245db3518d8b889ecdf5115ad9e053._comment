You're taking a very long and strange way to a place that you can reach as follows:

<pre>
git pull remote
git annex get .
</pre>

Which is just as shown in [[walkthrough/getting_file_content]]. 

In particular, \"git pull remote\" first fetches all branches from the remote, including the git-annex branch.
When you say \"git pull remote master\", you're preventing it from fetching the git-annex branch. 
If for some reason you want the slightly longer way around, it is:

<pre>
git pull remote master
git fetch remote git-annex
git annex get .
</pre>

Or, eqivilantly but with less network connections:

<pre>
git fetch remote
git merge remote/master
git annex get .
</pre>

BTW, notice that this is all bog-standard git branch pulling stuff, not specific to git-annex in the least.
Consult your extensive and friendly git documentation for details. :)
