Doh! Total brain melt on my part. Thanks for the additional info.  Not taking my time and reading things properly - kept assuming that the full remote pull failed due to the warning:

    You asked to pull from the remote 'rss', but did not specify
    a branch. Because this is not the default configured remote
    for your current branch, you must specify a branch on the command line.

Rookie mistake indeed.
