Gosh, I don't know. Android's permission model is not really designed to
make it very usable as a general unix system like this. Unfortunately.

You might be able to get away with just copying the files from the
git-annex app into the sheper app.

I think that a better option though, would be to run git-annex on the phone
and let it notice when a change is made to the repository, and pull.
The best way to set that up is to use the web app to add a repository on a
ssh server. As long as the ssh server is running git-annex 5.20140405
or newer, the git-annex on the phone will be able to instantly notice when
changes are pushed into the ssh server, and will pull them down to the
phone.
