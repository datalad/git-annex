after upgrading to git-annex 3, i'm stuck with diverging git-annex branches -- i didn't manage to follow this line in the directions:

> After this upgrade, you should make sure you include the git-annex branch when git pushing and pulling.

could you explain how to do that in a littel more detail? git pull seems to only merge master, although i have these ``.git/config`` settings:

    [branch "git-annex"]
    	remote = origin
    	merge = git-annex
