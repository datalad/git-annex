Git has an option to initialize repos in a shared mode (`git init --shared=group`); then it sets all relevant files not only to group writable, but also sets sticky bits so that the group is preserved.

This does also work with git-annex. (It doesn't work so well when users rsync-copy data to that shared repository, but a) that may have been fixed since I stopped letting multiple users do it, and b) it probably doesn't apply to your use case).
