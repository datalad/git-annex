The git-annex assistant will automatically retry uploads/downloads, if you
want to use it.

Or, you can use a simple loop until git-annex succeeds:

	while ! git-annex annex copy newdir/* --to my-s3-remote ; do echo retry ; done

As to picking up where it left off, make sure you have a recent
release of git-annex, and then you can enable chunking for a S3
remote. git-annex can then resume an upload or download starting
at the next chunk that needs to be transferred.

See [[chunking]].
