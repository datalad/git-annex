It seems to me that you could just click on "syncing enabled" in the
webapp, to toggle it to "syncing disabled". This stops all data transfers
without killing the program.

The problem you describe with stopping doesn't quite make sense to me.

For one things, `git annex assistant --autostop` does the exact same
thing as changing directory into the repo and `git annex assistant --stop`.
But, you seem to say that one works and the other doesn't.

For another, `git annex assistant --stop` does exactly the same thing as
killing the process by hand! That is, it sends it a TERM signal. 
Perhaps you killed the process by hand with a stronger signal than TERM,
but I don't see how even that would cause it to need to repair the repo.

Why is launchd restarting the daemon when it exits?
`~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.branchable.git-annex.assistant.plist`
has RunAtLoad set, which AFAIK is supposed to make it run it once
when you log in. It does not have KeepAlive set, so unless you've changed
the configuration to include KeepAlive, I don't know why launchd would
behave that way.
