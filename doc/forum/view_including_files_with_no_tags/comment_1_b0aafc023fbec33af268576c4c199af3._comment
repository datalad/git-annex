This is a TODO:

http://git-annex.branchable.com/design/metadata/

    unmatched files in filtered branches

    TODO Files not matching the view should be able to be included in the filtered branch, in a special location, an \"other\" directory.

In the meantime, I do this before switching to the view:

    git annex metadata -s fieldIwant?=untagged

This shows the files without any \"fieldIwant\" in the directory \"untagged\". Afterwards, I could (but don't need to in my workflow, it automatically gets removed), do this to remove it:

    git annex metadata -s fieldIwant-=untagged

What the \"?=\" does is add that metadata only if the \"fieldIwant\" hasn't been set at all.
