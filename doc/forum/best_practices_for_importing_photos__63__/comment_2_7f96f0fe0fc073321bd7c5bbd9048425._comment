It seems to me that there is a lot of cruft in EXIF that I would not want to bloat my git-annex branch with storing. That's why [[tips/automatically_adding_metadata]] imports only the listed fields. It's easy to add fields later and re-run the metadata importer on your existing files.

I have not gotten as far as having any best practices to share. :)
