After some debugging I found another weird thing which is I think the reason. If I execute
    git annex get file.jpg

everything works. But if I do

    \"c:\program files (x86)\git\bin\git.exe\" annex get file.jpg

it fails, claiming it can't connect to host \"annex\". I found that there are 3 (!) git.exe installed. When I choose

    \"c:\program files (x86)\git\cmd\git.exe\" annex get file.jpg

it works again. When I use \"which git\" in cygwin, it also points me to the \"cmd/git.exe\" version.
So I think this is a bug and git annex assistant should call the executeable in \"cmd\" rather than \"bin\".
Why are there three versions of git.exe at all (one more is in directory libexec/git-core)?
