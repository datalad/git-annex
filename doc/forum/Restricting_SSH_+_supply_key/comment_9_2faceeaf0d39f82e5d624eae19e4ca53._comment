Hi Joey,

Thanks for taking care about all these Windows troubles (Windows and POSIX is unfortunately a big mess).

I finally found the issue now and maybe the bug is related to msysgit. I guess you don't know too much about it so I will report to the msysgit folks.

However, there is still an (easy to fix) \"bug\" related to git-annex I think. I shortly describe the issue and a possible fix:

1.) As mentioned above, from the 3 git.exe, only the one in \"cmd\" should be called! It seems to be a wrapper for the \"bin\"-version. If the git.exe from \"bin\" is called something with the environment is wrong (e.g., ssh_config can not be found)

2.) cmd/git.exe is in %PATH% so usually no problem

3.) However, git-annex-autostart.vbs is in \"bin\" folder. Therefore, when called from there PWD is the \"bin\" folder and when calling \"git.exe\" without absolute path, this overwrites %PATH% because it's the current directory (of course, such behavior does not appear on UNIX).

4.) Now the git-annex assistant daemon always calls the wrong git.exe resulting in a broken config


Short term fix for users: Create a shortcut to git-annex-autostart.vbs and change the working directory to anything else

Long term fix for git-annex option 1: Do a chdir in the vbs file before calling git. This is not so good because where to?

Long term fix for git-annex option 2: Just place the vbs files in the parent directory (where \"Git Bash.vbs\" is). This looks like the cleanest solution to me.
