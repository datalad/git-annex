Re the ssh config on Windows, my windows VM has a per-user .ssh/config inside c:\Documents and Settings\$user. This is where the assistant stores configurations so I know it works.

The soution to ssh still trying to use the agent is probably to set \"IdentitiesOnly yes\" in the stanza for a host. This is what the assistant does, anyway.
