1. Yes, use [[git-annex-shell]].

2. The best way to do this is to use a dummy hostname in the git url for the remote. Then in .ssh/config, you can add a Host stanza that sets the real Hostname and also specifies the IdentityFile to use for that host.

Incidentially, the git-annex webapp takes care of both of these things for you automatically when setting up a remote on a ssh server.
