Hi Joey,

Sorry that I bother so much with this.
Thank you so much for your answer. At least with the command line it works now. I had it in %USERPROFILE%/.ssh/ssh_config (where I think it's supposed to be) rather than %USERPROFILE%/.ssh/config. In this file I have a stanza \"Host annex\" with Hostname, Port and IdentityFile set. When I call \"ssh annex\" from the command line everything works. It seems that it also works when I use e.g. \"git annex sync\" from the command line.

However, if I use the webapp, the daemon.log is full of:

    Please make sure you have the correct access rights
    and the repository exists.
    ssh: Could not resolve hostname annex: hostname nor servname provided, or not known
    fatal: Could not read from remote repository.

Is it possible that the assistant ignores the ssh config or does something differently?

Thanks again!
