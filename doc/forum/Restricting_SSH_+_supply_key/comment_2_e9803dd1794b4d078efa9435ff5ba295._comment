Hey Joey,

Cool, that's great! Thanks!

As for the client side. I assume you probably don't know too much about the git setup on Windows ... but maybe (or someone else has an idea :)

1.) The ssh client config for git is \"c:\Program Files (x86)\Git\etc\ssh\ssh_config\" which is *very* unhandy since it's system wide! If it would at least be in the user profile ... (as mentioned, within the \".git\" directory of the repository would be the best)

2.) Even if I create a \"Host\" and use \"IdentityFile\", ssh still queries the agent! This is absolutely unwanted and slows down things! I have a particular key \"git-annex.key\" and *only* this should be tried - no agent. The reason why the agent is especially problematic for me is that I use a special agent which \"locks\" itself after some inactivity and requires to re-enter the passwords.

Thank you!
