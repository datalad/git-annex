Thanks Joey,

The problem is more that git-annex assistant takes the wrong (which is in \"bin\" rather than \"cmd\"). I think this is a bug. Because this way the connection does not work in git-annex assistant the same way it does not work with the version in \"bin\" ...

I think when git-annex assistant just calls the git.exe from path (which should be cmd/git.exe) then it should work.

Regards
Niki
