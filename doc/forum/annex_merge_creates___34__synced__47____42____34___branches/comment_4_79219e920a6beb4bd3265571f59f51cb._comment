delete the *synced/master* branch:
```
$ git branch -d synced/master
Branch synced/master entfernt (war 20ec8b3).
```

then call *annex merge*:
```
$ git annex merge
merge git-annex ok
```

check branches:
```
$ git branch -a
  git-annex
* master
  synced/master
  remotes/origin/git-annex
  remotes/origin/master
```
and there is the *synced/master* branch again.

But that's not my problem. My problem was: how to use annex with a central repository.
I done that by deleting all remote synced/* branches. And now I'm updating the git-annex branch by `git fetch`ing and
`git annex merge`ing again.

PS: the MD for code blocks is broken
