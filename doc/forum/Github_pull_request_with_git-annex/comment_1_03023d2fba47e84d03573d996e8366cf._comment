Your pull request should be for the branch you changed. In this case, the
`master` branch. This is the same as adding files to a regular git
repository and making a pull request for that.

The changes that git-annex makes to the `git-annex branch` can either be
ignored by the person who merges your pull request, or they could opt to
fetch your git-annex branch and let git-annex auto-merge it for them. A
manual review and pull request of the `git-annex` branch is not likely to be
productive. Whether they need to merge your `git-annex` branch into their
`git-annex` branch depends on whether git-annex's information about eg,
locations of file contents needs to be passed along with your pull
request.

Note that GitHub does not support using git-annex to upload the content of
annexed files to it. (GitLab does support this.) This GitHub limitation
may cause problems with this kind of workflow.
