Hi,
  After a long time, and having a fresh machine, I cloned a repo I've been using without problems. When I try to get the content of some files, I get the following error:

> git annex get  im/fixed_regions/melanomas/melanomas_mp/ejemplo18/mean_bounds.png

get im/fixed_regions/melanomas/melanomas_mp/ejemplo18/mean_bounds.png (from origin...) 

git-annex-shell: Action blocked by GIT_ANNEX_SHELL_LIMITED

I've checked that the file is present in the origin remote. I'm sure it is a pretty silly thing, but it's been a while since I used git-annex.
Thanks for the help and kudos for this great tool!
