Actually, it may be a good idea to remove repositories made for tests purposes.

I now have 2 dead repositories that are USB_test1 and USB_test2 that I created before knowing I could reuse the annex uuid.

They are now there and it is difficult to remove them.

For that special case, the --drop-dead feature is very welcome.
