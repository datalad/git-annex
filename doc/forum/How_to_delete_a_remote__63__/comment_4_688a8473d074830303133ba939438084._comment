I followed these instructions, but a single entry for the targeted UUID persists in vicfg.

For those of us with OCD, this is mildly irksome. Later I might have dead UUID's I actually want to remember, and that bit of spam will always be sitting there at the top of the file.

However, deleting it is still worthwhile, because otherwise it is repeated in every list of remotes.
