There was a previous thread about using DVDS:
<http://git-annex.branchable.com/forum/Managing_a_large_number_of_files_archived_on_many_pieces_of_read-only_medium___40__E.G._DVDs__41__>

If the bluerays are rewritable, I'd probably just slap a Real Filesystem
(ext2 not isofs) on there and put a regular git-annex repo on it. I'd probably
run git-annex with the option "-c annex.alwayscommit=false" to prevent it
making many commits to the repo on the blueray, which would rewrite parts of
this disk, perhaps too often.

Or, to avoid any rewrites at all (except to directory metadata),
I might use a directory special remote on the blueray.

I don't see much benefit to using bup over the directory special remote.

If the bluerays are not rewritable, I might try making the git-annex repo
in a temporary directory on the hard disk, and then generating the ISO
from that once I've filled it up. Should work fine, I might set "remote.<name>.annex-readonly"
to true in git repos that had such a disk as a remote to let git-annex
know to not try to write to it.
