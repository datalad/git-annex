If you go to one of the repos and run `git annex info --json --bytes`
you'll get a json object that has keys including "local annex size".
You can extract that value, and feed it into a graphing engine, such
as graphite, or whatever to generate graphs of the repo sizes over time.

(Of course, you could do the same thing with `du`)
