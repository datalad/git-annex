I have seen a similar sounding version on Centos 6.5. I had git version 2.6.4 and installed git annex using:
wget http://download.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/6/x86_64/epel-release-6-8.noarch.rpm
rpm -ivh epel-release-6-8.noarch.rpm
yum install git-annex

git annex would hang when running 'git annex add'

When I changed the git version to be 1.7.1 this problem went away. So it is something to do with the combination of client git version and git annex version.
