Actually the situation is even more complex.

\"The server\" where my repo is stored are actually 4 servers for load balancing that share a single file system.

I just found out that on one of the servers the were still some git-annex-shell processes running. Probably the move command with -J10 logged in on different servers; maybe this confused git-annex.

Now, I logged-in on all four servers and killed any remaining processes. Still the problem persists.

What's interesting is that these killing actions apparently have changed the hash number on which the hang happens (76cf..). What I also did was git-annex sync at another host, this actually seemed to work. Maybe this changed the hash.. I'm not entirely sure..
