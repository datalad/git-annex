Probably the same problem reported here:
<https://github.com/datalad/datalad/issues/12>

I guess this is a mismatch between the version of git that git-annex was built with and the version it's using. In particular, git check-attr behavior varies between git older than 1.7.7 and newer, and git-annex picks the version at build time.

So, I think this is a broken Ubuntu PPA, and if that's the current one, the maintainer of the PPA needs to be contacted to update the git-annex to match the git version, or depend on an appropriate git version.
