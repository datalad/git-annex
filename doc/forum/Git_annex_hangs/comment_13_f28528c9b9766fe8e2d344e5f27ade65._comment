Hi,

I'm not sure what exactly has changed, but it's working again!

Until now, I was using git-annex version: 6.20170321-gf3dee9d65 from the standalone-amd64.tar.gz. In the meantime I convinced the administrator to install git-annex system wide. She installed git-annex version: 5.20140221 from the packet-system.

Now, the repository works again with both, git-annex 5 and 6.

However, I cannot exactly tell if anything else has changed in the meantime, since I am not the administrator of the system.

Thanks for your help, anyway.
