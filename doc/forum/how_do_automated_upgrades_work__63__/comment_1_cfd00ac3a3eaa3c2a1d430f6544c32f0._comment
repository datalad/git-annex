The assistant checks for available upgrades a few times a day.
By default, it only pops up a message in the webapp with an upgrade button.

annex.autoupgrade can configure this, so the assistant can be made
to upgrade without confirmation if you want.

The upgrade process needs to move the git-annex.linux directory out of the
way and replace it with a new one from the tarball, so it will only
work if the user running the assistant can write to it.
