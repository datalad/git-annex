I believe I have a similar set up as you're trying to achieve. What I did was just add a repository using the public domain name only (DDNS). My home router seems to be smart enough to realize the IP the domain name resolves to is its own, so I get gigabit speeds when at home, and I can still access it when I'm not at home.
