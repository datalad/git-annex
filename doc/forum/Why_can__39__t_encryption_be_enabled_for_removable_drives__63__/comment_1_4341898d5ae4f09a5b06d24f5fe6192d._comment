git-annex stores a clone of the git repository on the removable drive. To encrypt a git remote, you can use the [git-remote-gcrypt](https://github.com/blake2-ppc/git-remote-gcrypt) tool. This will work with git-annex, but it needs integration into the webapp to support setting it up, and further integration so git-annex can detect when a git remote is encrypted and also encrypt the contents of file is stores there.
