It seems that the uuid is present in the group.log and preferred-content.log files in the git-annex branch, but not in the uuid.log file. I missed that in your description before. That's weird, don't know how that could happen.

However, when I manually configure things this way, I do not see the repository in the webapp. Which makes sense; uuid.log is the canonical list of repositories.

I guess if I were you I'd manually edit the uuid into uuid.log and then mark it dead.
