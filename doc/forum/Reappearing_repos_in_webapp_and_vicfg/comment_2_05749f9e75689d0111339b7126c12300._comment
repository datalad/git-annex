Hi,

I should have mentioned I can't do this either:

    ~/current $ git annex dead 40da403e-6f74-4705-aae0-433aa656b55e
    dead 40da403e-6f74-4705-aae0-433aa656b55e git-annex: there is no available git remote named \"40da403e-6f74-4705-aae0-433aa656b55e\"

I can't quite remember how I removed the remote - it was a whilst back, I think maybe I just edited it out of the git config file....
