I just found [this thread](http://git-annex.branchable.com/forum/Tracking_a_directory_with_some_hg_and_git_repositories/) where a user was discouraged from syncing git repositories with annex.

I've used unison in the past for this. Sure, it would occasionally create a few unneeded object files; but these got removed during the next \"git gc\", and never corrupted a repository... Do people know of any better way to handle this problem?
