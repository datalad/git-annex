You could make a special remote that streams the whole tar file from the
tape, and uses `git annex setkey` to add each file from the tarball to the
annex.

Done this way, the first file that `git annex get` processed would actually
cause *every* file to be gotten from the tape. As it continued on to
subsequent files, the `git annex get` would see their content was already
present and skip them.

Of course, the downside is it works on a whole tape at a time, so if you
don't want to load the whole tape into the filesystem, you wouldn't want to
use this approach.
