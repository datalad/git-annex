I tried to build the Android app according to the instructions on [the install page](https://git-annex.branchable.com/install/Android/).

But during step 2 (In the chroot, run install-haskell-packages) cabal fails to handle the dependencies correctly. So I tried to change the standalone/android/cabal.config file to update all the dependencies, but this had me running into something I think is unresolvable in another package's
dependencies. Eventually I had the following output:

    # ./standalone/android/install-haskell-packages 
    Downloading the latest package list from hackage.haskell.org
    Skipping download: Local and remote files match.
    /home/repo/git-annex /home/repo/git-annex/standalone/android
    Resolving dependencies...
    cabal: Could not resolve dependencies:
    trying: git-annex-6.20160318 (user goal)
    trying: persistent-template-2.1.6/installed-08b... (dependency of
    git-annex-6.20160318)
    next goal: monad-control (dependency of git-annex-6.20160318)

    requires ==0.3.2.2)

    requires ==0.3.2.2)

This tells me that the package persistent-template depends on the package monad-control at a version of 1.0.0.5. So I look at the [persistent-template hackage page](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/persistent-template-2.1.6) and see that it lists its dependency on monad-control as:

    monad-control (>=0.2 && <1.1)

And I don't think that's possible to resolve.

All I wanted to do was change the icons on the Android package, so if you'll just accept the changed
icons folder, I can submit the patch without testing the Android build, but currently I'm unable to build the Android port of git-annex.
