That error message seems to occur when git-annex is trying to upgrade itself to a newer version, but for some reason the temporary directory it uses for gpg allows some other user to write to it. Perhaps because of a wacky umask, I don't know. AFAICS it's only a warning and the upgrade still works, but I have made git-annex force a sane umask when creating this temp directory.
