I'm not sure I understand what you mean.

Do you mean that I should clone the s3 bucket with a tool like git-remote-s3? I'm not sure how to do that.

I tried downloading the whole bucket from backblaze, but since I enabled encryption on the bucket, backblaze doesn't let me download the encrypted files. I'm not sure yet if I can get those files using their api.

Just in case I didn't explain correctly what I'm trying to do, I'm trying to do something like this, on a new computer with a fresh ~/Document:

```bash
❯ cd ~/Documents
❯ git init
Initialized empty Git repository in /home/bbigras/Documents/.git/
❯ git annex init
init  ok
(recording state in git...)
❯ git annex initremote backblaze type=S3 signature=v4 host=s3.us-west-000.backblazeb2.com bucket=my-bucket protocol=https encryption=hybrid keyid=my-key-id
initremote backblaze (encryption setup) (to gpg keys: my-key-id) (checking bucket...)
  The bucket already exists, and its annex-uuid file indicates it is used by a different special remote.

git-annex: Cannot reuse this bucket.
failed
initremote: 1 failed
```
