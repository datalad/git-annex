Hi,

I was wondering whether it was possible to configure git annex in a way, that new content is held in a specific repository until it is considered old.

I found that "git config annex.genmetadata true" creates year and month tags in the metadata. However, creating the wanted expression poses a problem. Afaik there is no way to access the current year/month in a wanted expression and no way to do arithmetic in a wanted expression. Furthermore, I do not know, when the assistant checks wanted expressions for matches? I assume it does so only when something changes in git or when the wanted expressions change but not in regular intervals?

I guess I could whip up a cronjob that changes the wanted expression every month and do the calculations outside of git annex but this seems somehow wrong. 

Is this a problem other users share or maybe have already solved?

Cheers,
Marek
