If I have an archive with a lot of big files, is it possible to get one of them without using the command line, and without it popping up on other clients of that repository?
Is it possible to have a folder that will not be synced with other clients but will still download the file when i copy it from archive?
.gitignore probably wont work because that will not get the file from archive.
