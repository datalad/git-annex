Yes, a separate repository is one way to go, although I do not think it would be very hard to get gerrit's internal ssh to run git-annex-shell.

[[git-annex-shell]] is a low-level restricted shell like git-shell, not a login manager, so it has nothing at all to do with ssh keys. Things like gitosis and gitolite can be built on top of git-shell and git-annex-shell and handle ssh key management.
