Awesome!! thanks, As i am kicking the tires, Based on my current scenario, How can i deploy this in my company , So each developer to do the bare minimum, Like just install git annex and it should work.

i.e. is it possible to avoid the step git remote add backup ? Then they can just do

$ yum install git-annex
$ cd repo
$ git checkout staging
$ git pull
$ git annex get large_file

And it then just works.
