Thank you very much!!!!! Yes, Planning to use Centralized repo. Basically what i understood was there will be a git server and separate server for hosting the large files. Its great to know i can use the same server and do not need to explicitly point to the server.

As we are using Gerrit, What is the general best practice for it. (After i am done with it, I will write a blog post, As i am sure many people with centralized repo's might need this)  
Thanks!
