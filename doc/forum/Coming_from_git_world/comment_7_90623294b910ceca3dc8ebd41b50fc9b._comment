Thanks, So i made some progress, In the gerrit repo server,  (which has git-annex installed)

I ran: 
    git annex init origin,

Did a clone of the repo, it had the branch git-annex, So i assumed all is working.

I did a 
    git annex add 
and 
    git push

Then when i try to 
    git annex copy --to origin

I get error , But git-annex-shell is installed on the machine:

    $ echo $PATH
    /usr/lib64/qt-3.3/bin:/usr/local/bin:/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/home/gerrit2/bin
    $ which git-annex-shell
    /usr/bin/git-annex-shell



    Gerrit Code Review: git-annex-shell: not found
    rsync: connection unexpectedly closed (0 bytes received so far) [sender]
    rsync error: error in rsync protocol data stream (code 12) at io.c(600) [sender=3.0.6]
    
    rsync failed -- run git annex again to resume file transfer failed
    
Any idea what i  need to do to make it work ?
