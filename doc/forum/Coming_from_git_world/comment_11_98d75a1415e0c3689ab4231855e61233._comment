:( Ahh... So i guess this might not be possible in near future.

Ill go to plan B, Setup another server which users will connect to for large files which will have git-annex installed. (So a central Repository for git annex). They will need to add another remote in git config.

Does git annex have a way to manage ssh keys ?  (Please can you point me to the location where i can read how git-annex-shell ? )
