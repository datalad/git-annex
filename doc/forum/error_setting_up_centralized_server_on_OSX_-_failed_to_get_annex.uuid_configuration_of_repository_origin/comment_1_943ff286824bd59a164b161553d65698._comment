Yeah, this is a bug, and one I was able to reproduce. It was introduced in
the last release of git-annex.

Luckily, it's only a cosmetic bug. The `git annex init` does
succeed, and your repo is left in an ok state. If you continue
along the walkthrough path, adding some files and syncing with origin, it
will proceed to set up the origin appropriately and everything should work.

I'm gonna fix the bug of course. Indeed, it's fixed in git master now.
