Thanks Joey!

Great, thanks. If I set these up outside of the WebApp, what is the best way to link them up to my main repositories?

Yes, I meant incremental backup. Thanks, understood. The page on preferred content ( http://git-annex.branchable.com/preferred_content/ ) made things a bit clearer. I didn't realise that the incremental backups etc want a copy even if it isn't necessary to satisfy numcopies. Does that mean that once it is on one backup drive, it will not be sent to the other unless I increase numcopies?
