Joey,

Sorry for asking again, but I haven't been able to resolve this using the symlinks.

Consider this file 

    ElgarCEH.pdf -> ../.git/annex/objects/g6/q8/SHA256E-759787--3ec5f8d64cc4f84dec74ed7f0f7a640b3e672a03faf0f5fc3daf0b823d596f03.pdf/SHA256E-759787--3ec5f8d64cc4f84dec74ed7f0f7a640b3e672a03faf0f5fc3daf0b823d596f03.pdf

The file that the symlink points to doesn't exist.  I'm not sure it should.  The file with {.map,.cahce} extensions does exist, in this case 

    sh>ls ../.git/annex/objects/g6/q8/SHA256E-s759787--3ec5f8d64cc4f84dec74ed7f0f7a640b3e672a03faf0f5fc3daf0b823d596f03.pdf/
       SHA256E-s759787--3ec5f8d64cc4f84dec74ed7f0f7a640b3e672a03faf0f5fc3daf0b823d596f03.pdf.cache
       SHA256E-s759787--3ec5f8d64cc4f84dec74ed7f0f7a640b3e672a03faf0f5fc3daf0b823d596f03.pdf.map

The content of the .cache file is 

    1703824 411810 1350480334

and the content of the .map file is 

    documents/ElgarCEH.pdf

However, for all of the following

    git add ElgarCEH.pdf
    git add --force ElgarCEH.pdf
    git annex add ElgarCEH.pdf

the files are not staged, and I get the message usual

    no changes added to commit.

with `git log`.

So do I need to something more in order to get `git` to add my symlinks?
