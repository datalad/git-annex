Joey,

Thanks for your useful tips and for providing this software.  It seems incredibly powerful and useful.  I made a copy of the folder which I messed up.  I will try the tips and report back (I'm on the road right now).

The other day all the Haskell deps worked out and I managed to build git annex.  Hopefully, this will give more reliable results as it seemed that some of my bugs were caused by the 32bit prebuild on 64bit.  If I succeed in recreating my files I will try to recreate the error :)
