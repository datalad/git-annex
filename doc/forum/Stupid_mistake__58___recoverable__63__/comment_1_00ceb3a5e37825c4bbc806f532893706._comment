The file contents are still there in `.git/annex/objects/`. 

When I run `git reset --hard`, it deletes any files that have been added, but not committed. You say you still have symlinks to the content. If so, you can just `git add` the symlinks and be back how git-annex wants things to be.

If, instead, you are missing the symlinks, then since you never committed the symlinks to git, there is no record anywhere in git of the filenames that go with the file contents. 

What you can do is ask git-annex to put back symlinks to the file contents:

<pre>
git annex unused
git annex addunused 1-10000
</pre>

This will make you have a bunch of files in the repository with names starting with \"unused\". You can then rename them manually.

BTW, I would of course be interested in any error message from `git commit`.
