Right.  Obliviously.  Sorry.


I think the problem is more severe as all of the files have somehow ended up in the .git/objects folder.  I have no idea how, but I have been unsuccessful with both methods (the second methods gives me 
    
    getFileStatus: does not exist (No such file or directory)

which I guess is related to the fact that my files somehow ended up in the git objects folder rather than the git annex objects folder.

I appreciated the help.

Cheers,
Rasmus
