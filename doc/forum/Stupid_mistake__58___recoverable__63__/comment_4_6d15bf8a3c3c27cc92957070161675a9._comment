If you `git add` a file and `git commit` says \"no changes added to commit\", what would you think would be the reason?

I'd think it was because the file was already committed to git. So that must be the case with your symlink.

You seem to have told git-annex to do something to the content of that file. You could use `git annex whereis` to find where it is, or `git annex get` to get it. (Assuming you have not used `git annex drop --force` on the file to nuke its content earlier.)
