If you can't segment the names retroactively, it's better to start with segmenting, imo.

As subdirectories are cheap, going with ab/cd/rest or even ab/cd/ef/rest by default wouldn't hurt.

Your point about git not needing to create as many tree objects is a kicker indeed. If I were you, I would default to segmentation.
