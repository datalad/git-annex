You might also use <http://myrepos.branchable.com/> as a somewhat
more flexible alternative to submodules.

It's worth thinking about what would happen if you were able to check a git
repository into a git (annex) repository. A git repository contains files
like `.git/index` that are git internals, and binary files. Now what
happens if you have two checkouts of that nested git-in-git repository, and
git writes two different versions of the `.git/index` file? You'd get a
merge conflict that you have no way of resolving, involving two versions of
an internal use binary file. This is a lot worse than a merge conflict involving
some regular binary file like a jpeg, because at least with jpegs you can
look at the two versions of the file and pick the better one.

While git prevents checking in `.git` directories, you could technically work
around it, if you really wanted to, by eg using `GIT_DIR` to rename
the `.git` directory to something else. But it's just setting yourself up for
unresolvable merge conflicts and pain.

It's likewise not good to check in other version control system
directories, like `.svn`, `.bzr`, or `.hg` into git repositories or
vice-versa.

Sometimes people complain that the git-annex assistant should support
syncing nested git repositories, because after all other directory syncing
tools like dropbox support that. But, a little known fact about dropbox is
that it too can end up with a conflicted merge type situation, and when
this happens it will do *something* to auto-resolve it. That something
almost certianly does not include leaving the git repository what was
stored in dropbox in an ideal state. So, while people put git repos into
dropbox and get away with it, they are just being lucky to not run into the
edge cases where doing that blows up.
