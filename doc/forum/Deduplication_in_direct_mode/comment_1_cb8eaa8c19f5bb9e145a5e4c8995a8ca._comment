There is really no way to do this.

We could consider hard-linking the files, but then modifying one would
modify the other, which is likely to be confusing. And, FAT doesn't support
hard links anyway.

I don't want to complicate git-annex's notion of whether an object is
present or not with the possibility that it might be present for some
files but not for others. For example, `git annex get` would then need
to make a copy of content that was already locally present, while
currently it knows that if the file is locally present, it has nothing to
do.

I think that the solution is to use either a better filesystem
which can support the suprerior indirect mode, or to switch your
repository to use the WORM backend which does not do deduplication.
