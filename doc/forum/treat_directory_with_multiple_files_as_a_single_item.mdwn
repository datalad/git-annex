In my analyses I often have multiple (>10k) generated  small files in a single directory.


I would like to store this in git annex, in order to version them and probably even synchronize. The problem is that if a huge number of files is stored inside the repository, the repository itself becomes huge and slow. There are some ways to improve the performance ([[1|tips/Repositories_with_large_number_of_files]], [[2|forum/Handling_a_large_number_of_files]], [[3|forum/__34__git_annex_sync__34___synced_after_8_hours]]), but it doesn't solve the issue completely.


I was wondering if it is possible to force git annex to treat a single directory with multiple files as a single item? Probably with abandoning the checksum verification.
