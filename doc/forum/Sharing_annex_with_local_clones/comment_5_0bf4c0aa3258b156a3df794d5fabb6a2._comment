Yes, there's another option since git-annex version 5.20140915.

annex.hardlink can be set to true, and then `git annex get` will
simply hardlink the files into place. 

Note the caution about using this option:

              Use with caution --  This  can  invalidate  numcopies  counting,
              since  with hard links, fewer copies of a file can exist. So, it
              is a good idea to  mark  a  repository  using  this  setting  as
              untrusted.

And, there's a nice easy way to set up local clone that is configured this way:

              When  a repository is set up using git clone --shared, git-annex
              init will automatically set annex.hardlink and mark the  reposi‚Äê
              tory as untrusted.
