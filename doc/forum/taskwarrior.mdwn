I try to sync my taskWarrior files .task/*.data with git-annex ... but there is two problem :

- i need to chmod 755 my files because taskWarrior doesn't recognize them, or say "problem with permission" 

- taskwarrior seems crazy with symbolic link used by git-annex, undo not work, task appear multiple times , etc.

Is there any solution ?
Any user experienced the same problem?

Thanks
Sr.
