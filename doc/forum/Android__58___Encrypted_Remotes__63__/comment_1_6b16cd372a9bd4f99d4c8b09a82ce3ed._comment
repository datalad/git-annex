Encrypted [[special_remotes]] are supported just fine on Android.

As for storing the [[encrypted git repository itself on a remote|special_remotes/gcrypt]], which is what git-remote-gcrypt is used for, it would need porting that to Android. I don't think that should be very hard (it's just a rather complicated shell script and all the tools it uses are already included in the git-annex bundle). I may eventully end up reimplementing git-remote-gcrypt as part of git-annex in Haskell, since porting it to eg, Windows is likely to be a lot harder..
