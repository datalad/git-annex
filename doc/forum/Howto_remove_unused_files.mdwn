Hello.

My case: I have somehow managed to get my repo, with quite much stuff inside it messed up.

There is single directory 'cities' containing quite many files (>10k) that i would rather see gone (and keep the tar.bz version of it ..). I tried doing 

    git drop --force

that works fine, but the files are still there after sync. 

git annex unused says just 'ok' so i guess it thinks they are still used somewhere. I tried to look where, but i ended up just doing git annex drop -f my_remote_here test_file_name for each of my remotes. This doesnt help. 
How can i get rid of these files? Doing git annex fsck shows that 


So, try to search what is the key:

     % ls -lah cities/diskcache/config.cfg
     lrwxrwxrwx 1 XX XXX 190 Nov 29 05:52 cities/diskcache/config.cfg -> ../../../../.git/annex/objects/qm/M6/SHA256-s32--4f5ce34d1b0b8d854a315530b2fdcbfa9c3067636a2aa5433a04402db4151dce/SHA256-s32--4f5ce34d1b0b8d854a315530b2fdcbfa9c3067636a2aa5433a04402db4151dce

So how can i deduce what is the remote i should try to clean up ?


Thanks!
