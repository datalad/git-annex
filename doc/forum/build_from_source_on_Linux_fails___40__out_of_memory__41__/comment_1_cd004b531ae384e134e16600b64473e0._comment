This is cabal trying to resolve the dependencies and failing to find any
solution, and trying harder and harder as it leaks memory somewhere.

IIRC newer versions of cabal behave better in these situations, but the
underlying problem is that there is a problem in your set of installed
haskell libraries that prevents cabal finding a solution.

cabal configure -v3 will show you the dependency resolver at work, and can be examined
to find the details. But, the easy solution is probably to use stackage
which will provide cabal with a canned dependency solution. Just copy
`standalone/linux/cabal.config` to the top of the source tree and re-run
cabal configure.
