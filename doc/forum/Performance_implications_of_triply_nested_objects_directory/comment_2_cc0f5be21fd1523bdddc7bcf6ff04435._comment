I suppose you misread something. Note that the 60s traversal was on the (slower) /external/ drive, and the 24minute traversal on the (faster) internal one, so if anything, the results become more pronounced because of the comparison.

In the meantime I converted the internal drive to btrfs, and the traversal time on SATA is now 30s, as opposed to the >20min on ext.
