It seems I can't initialize git annex:

    $ git annex init "files2"
    init files2 
      pre-commit hook (/Volumes/project/annex/.git/hooks/pre-commit) already exists, not configuring
    
    git-annex: waitToSetLock: failed (Operation not supported)
    failed
    git-annex: init: 1 failed
    $


  `project` is a remote file server connected via `smb://`.

   Any ideas why and how to fix?
