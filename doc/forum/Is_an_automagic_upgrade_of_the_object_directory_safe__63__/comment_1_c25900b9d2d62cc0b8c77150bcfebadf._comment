These are good examples; I think you've convinced me at least for upgrades going forward after v2. I'm not sure we have enough users and outdated git-annex installations to worry about it for v1.

(Hoping such upgrades are rare anyway.. Part of the point of changes made in v2 was to allow lots of changes to be made later w/o needing a v3.)

Update: Upgrades from v1 to v2 will no longer be handled automatically
now.
