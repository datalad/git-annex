Hi,

I was trying to install git-annex, but then, I got a warning saying that I need to install base-4.5.0.0 first.

So, I did "sudo cabal install base-4.5.0.0". Everything was going well, until I got this error:

config.status: error: cannot find input file: `base.buildinfo.in'
cabal: Error: some packages failed to install:
base-4.5.0.0 failed during the configure step. The exception was:
ExitFailure 1

I tried to look for information on the internet, but I did not find anything useful.

I know that this is not totally related to git-annex, but anyone has any thoughts on this?
