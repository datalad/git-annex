Thanks joey, I thought of the object storage just yesterday and that the drive where it resides needs to be the big one. 

I think that I will do it as you described with one addition:

I set up the git-annex repository on my big drive. Lets call that BIG.
Then I set up another on the smaller drive (or raid) and set both to sync. Lets call that RAID.

BUT: Can I use num copies to tell BIG to only sync files in certain directories to RAID. Or will syncing sync everything regardless?

Thanks for your help
