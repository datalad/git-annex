Recent git-annex's support `git annex reinject --known`

You can do this -- but do note that it leaves Global in an unusable state,
so only do it if you don't plan to use that repository again:

	chmod -R +w $Global/.git/annex/objects/
	git annex reinject --known $(find $Global/.git/annex/objects/ -type f)

BTW, splitting the files amoung several git branches is also a useful
thing to do in this situation. Splitting amoung branches avoids most of
git's problems with a repository having too many files in it.
