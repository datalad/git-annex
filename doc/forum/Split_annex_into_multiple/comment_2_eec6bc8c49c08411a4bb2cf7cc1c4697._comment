So actually \"import --reinject-duplicates\" solves the issue of reinject not being recursive.


That trick on .git/annex/objects/ is cunning, but the destruction of Global before everything has been finished is discomforting...if only there was a \"--reinject-duplicates --duplicate\" option for import.

No chance that I can make a recursive copy of .git/annex/objects with hardlinks can I? To then use with reinject-duplicates?
