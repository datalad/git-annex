You're using a version of git-annex that is nearly 2 years old.
Upgrading to a new version should be the very first thing you try in such a situation..

Sounds like probably this changelog entry is relevant, from version 
6.20160418.

  * Fix hang when dropping content needs to lock the content on a
    ssh remote, which occurred when the remote has git-annex version
    5.20151019 or newer. (The bug was in the client side; the remote
    git-annex-shell does not need to be upgraded.)

And it appears that hang first appeared in git-annex version 5.20151009.
