I'd recommend that you just copy your files to the repository to publish them before running git-annex sync.

Alternatively, unless your web pages are very large, you can just check them into git directly, still use git-annex sync if you want (and still using git-annex for large files), and avoid the complication of being able to have files that are listed in the repository but whose content is not present.
