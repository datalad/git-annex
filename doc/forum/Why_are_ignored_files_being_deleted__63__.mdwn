How do we get into the following situation?
First we complain about an ignored file (why not just ignore it?),
and then apparently we delete the ignored file.

    [...]
    import Pictures/2005/11/16/.IMG_0819.tmpwrite.JPG (duplicate) ok
    (Recording state in git...)
    The following paths are ignored by one of your .gitignore files:
    Pictures/2008/11/27/.img_1315.tmpwrite.jpg
    Use -f if you really want to add them.
    fatal: no files added
    git-annex: user error (xargs ["-0","git","--git-dir=/.../annex/.git","--work-tree=/.../annex","add","--"] exited 123)

    # eek, the file that we complained about has vanished!
    $ rm ../Pictures/2008/12/27/.img_1315.tmpwrite.jpg
    rm: cannot remove ‘../Pictures/2008/11/27/.img_1315.tmpwrite.jpg’: No such file or directory

Expected:
- leave ignored files untouched. Maybe report "Skipped ignored files."

Actual:
- Stop import, but delete the ignored file as side effect.
