How do we get into the following situation?
First we complain about an ignored file (why not just ignore it?),
and then apparently we delete the ignored file.

```
[...]
import Pictures/2005/11/16/.IMG_0819.tmpwrite.JPG (duplicate) ok
(Recording state in git...)
The following paths are ignored by one of your .gitignore files:
Pictures/2008/11/27/.img_1315.tmpwrite.jpg
Use -f if you really want to add them.
fatal: no files added
git-annex: user error (xargs ["-0","git","--git-dir=/.../annex/.git","--work-tree=/.../annex","add","--"] exited 123)

# eek, the file that we complained about has vanished!
$ rm ../Pictures/2008/12/27/.img_1315.tmpwrite.jpg
rm: cannot remove ‘../Pictures/2008/11/27/.img_1315.tmpwrite.jpg’: No such file or directory
```

Expected:
- leave ignored files untouched. Maybe report "Skipped ignored files."

Actual:
- Stop import, but delete the ignored file as side effect.
