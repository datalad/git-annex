Hi,


question. What is exactly the use-case for addurl. To add unique files as if they where never changing resources?

There is a --relaxed flag to enable some leniency in redownloading the file it seems. But how would one go about updating a file from the web, drop it first?
Or do I have to add pseudo queries or hashes to the URLs to keep them unique and manage any versioning that way perhaps?
