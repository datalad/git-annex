I tried to reproduce this behavior, but failed. My configuration was 2 repos, A and B, with B the origin of A. A was configured with \"exclude=archive/kronos/*\"
(also tried \"(exclude=archive/kronos/* ) or (not copies=semitrusted+:1)\")

<pre>
joey@darkstar:~/tmp/A>git annex get --auto
joey@darkstar:~/tmp/A>git annex get
get archive/kronos/foo (from origin...) ok
(Recording state in git...)
joey@darkstar:~/tmp/A>git annex drop --auto
drop archive/kronos/foo ok
(Recording state in git...)
joey@darkstar:~/tmp/A>git annex get --auto
joey@darkstar:~/tmp/A>
</pre>

... Which is how you want it to behave.

So I wonder if it's something else in your configuration. The best thing to do would be if you can come up with a series of commands I can follow to build repositories that exhibit the problem.
