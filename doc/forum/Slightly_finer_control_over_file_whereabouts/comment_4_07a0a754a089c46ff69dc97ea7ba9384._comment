I am testing on my laptop, and the content expression there is
`(exclude=archive/kronos/* ) or (not copies=semitrusted+:1)`
to simplify things; I interpret this to mean it wants everything not in archive/kronos, and it wants things there where that's the only copy.

The problem is that `git annex drop --auto` does indeed drop things, but `git annex get --auto` gets them; surely it should not be possible for that to happen?

I also tried the preferred content expression of `(exclude=archive/kronos/* )`, and the same thing happens.

The version of git-annex that I am using is
