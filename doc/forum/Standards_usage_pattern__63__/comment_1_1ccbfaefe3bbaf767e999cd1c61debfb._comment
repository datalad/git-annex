I think you need at least one server that is reachable from every device and serves as a transfer repository. XMPP is only needed to inform peers about changes. Usual the assistant performs a startup check and detects changes that way. You can't sync content over XMPP. 
All that is very afaik, I hope for corrections if wrong.
