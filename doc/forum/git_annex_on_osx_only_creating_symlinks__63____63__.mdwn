I'm testing out git-annex between a few computers one being a mac (osx 10.9) and a laptop (linux mint 16).  With a vps running git annex as a transfer annex.

Anyway sync is *almost* working...

When I add files on my mac's annex they upload, and go to my laptop as they should.

When I add files on my laptop's annex they upload, and the mac "downloads" them but only creates broken symlinks to the files.


I looked in the log and nothing out of the ordinary is happening... is this a bug with the osx version or what?


**more info**  

* the symlink on the osx annex is symlinking to a file in .git/annex/objects  
* the osx annex changes the aliases to real files every time I restart the git annex daemon  

Thanks!
