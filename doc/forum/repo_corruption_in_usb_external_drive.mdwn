I'm sorry to ask this again, but I'm not being able to find my previous message regarding this issue. I'm finding very hard to find older posts in forums. Is there a way to search for all my posted messages?
Anyway, after some automount problems (changed mount point name), my usb repo (direct) ended in a weird state.
See for instance the screenshot: <http://picpaste.com/git-annex-problem-eZvOl90y.jpg>

In addition making a git-annex info gives the following:

What should I do? delete the usb repo and start again. Thank god this is just a trial.

What happens if a file gets corrupted. Lets say it is corrupted in repo A, and fine in repo B. Will the good copy be overridden?

git-repair takes a long time and seems to be stuck there, or maybe it just takes a long time (10Gb repo). Is this normal?

Thanks in advance.
