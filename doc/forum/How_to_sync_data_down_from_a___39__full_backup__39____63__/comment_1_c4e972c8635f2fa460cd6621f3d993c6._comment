Yes, it absolutely does. On Android, git-annex defaults to making
its repository be a "source" repository, which means it doesn't try
to get a copy of every file. You can edit the repository in the webapp,
and select "client" and it will go ahead and download every file it can
get. See [[preferred_content/standard_groups]].

It sounds like you might want to have the android device only
get copies of certian files, and ignore others (the raws).
Doing that is a little more complicated; it involves writing a
[[preferred_content]] expression. You can do this by first exiting
the webapp, and the at the git-annex app's console:

	cd /sdcard/annex
	git annex wanted . "include=sheetmusic/* and exclude=raws/*"

Then when you start the webapp back up, it will get the sheet music 
and not the raws. Adjust paths in that to suite..
