Ok, I found PART of the answer here : <https://git-annex.branchable.com/forum/Two_computers__44___one_networked_repository__44___no_Jabber_-_how_to_setup_sync__63___/>

It is mentioned to use Jabber to make both clients message each other when there is something new to sync. What about my setup with 2 groups of repos syncing together each for itself ? I read somewhere, that the jabber account will sync ALL repos. Is the solution to create 2 Jabber accounts ?
