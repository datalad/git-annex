Is it possible to mount the snapshot and edit it? If so, you could skip
making the CoW copy of it, and just go into it, unset annex.uuid and
`git-annex init`. Then proceed with the fsck etc.

There's no way around needing to fsck, it needs to update its location
tracking logs for the new uuid, and fsck is as good a tool as any.
(Obviously --fast can be used.)
