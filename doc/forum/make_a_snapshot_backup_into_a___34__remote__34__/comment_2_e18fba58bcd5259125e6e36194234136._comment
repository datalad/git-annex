> Is it possible to mount the snapshot and edit it?

may be, but I better make (it is cheap) an snapshot of the snapshot with some explicit annotation (e.g. `-4shub-gitannex` suffix) before introducing any changes: after all snapshots are backups and better stay identical to the origin.  But gotcha overall -- thank you, will proceed per above plan
