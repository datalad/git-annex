I have the exact same issue: two copies of photos and videos that I have been using rsync to maintain. Converted one disk to git-annex, cloned the repo and moved .git/ into the second but can't seem to find a fast way to move the files to the correct hash id in the annex dir and create the symlinks. I'm thinking it might be best to just do a `git init; git annex init; git annex add .; git commit` then add the remotes in both directions and \"sync\".
