Sorry that nobody answered your question until now..

These .variant files preserve both versions of the files that were
committed in the two different repositories. If you can identify which
variant you don't want, you can just delete that one, and rename the other
.variant file back to the original file name.

There's no really great way to tell which variant is which. 
I'd look at the contents of the variants of the file, unless there are
too many files to look at.

Another approach is to look at the git log, find the commit that merged
the unwanted changed (and created these variant files), and `git revert` that
merge, and the earlier commit that was made accidentally.
