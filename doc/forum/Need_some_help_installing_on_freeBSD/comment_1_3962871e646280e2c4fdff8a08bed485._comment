it also seems like the git annex webapp command needs lsof, had to install it separately.

I then figured out one has to start the webapp with a listen command to prevent it from opening a browser.
*git annex webapp --listen=internal_IP*

Not sure how this option will work: Start the git-annex assistant at boot or on login. - as I assume I get a different auth URL with every start?
Any help available to get *git annex webapp --listen=internal_IP* to auto-start with every reboot?
