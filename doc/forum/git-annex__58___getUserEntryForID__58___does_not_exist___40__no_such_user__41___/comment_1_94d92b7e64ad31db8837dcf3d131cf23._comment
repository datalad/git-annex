IIRC it's supposed to be possible to configure a system such as LDAP 
so that `getpwuid` queries it, instead of failing as it seems to on your
system, using `/etc/nsswitch.conf`. But I'm not sure about that or how to
do it and you'd need to be the admin of the system.

git-annex has three calls to `getpwuid` (aka getUserEntryForID`).
In two of them it first looks at commonly set environment variables
(HOME and USER/LOGNAME) and only uses `getpwuid` as a fallback.
It seems reasonable to crash when git-annex can't determine the user's home
directory or username in code that needs it, especially since all three
environment variables are almost always going to be set.

The third use is a GECOS lookup, and here there's no corresponding
environment variable and git-annex can deal without knowing the full name
of the user. So, I've made that not crash if `getpwuid` fails.

(There's also a little-used code path where `getpwnam` is used 
to expand `~` in a git remote path. Seems best to leave this crashing
too if used on a system that does not have a working `getpwnam`.)

So, you can try upgrading to an autobuild that has the fix, and if it still
crashes, check that HOME and USER are set.
