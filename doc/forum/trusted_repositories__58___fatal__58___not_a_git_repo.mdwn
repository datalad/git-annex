When issuing a `git annex info`, I get:

~~~

The troubling part (I think) is `trusted repositories: fatal: Not a git repository: '/home/micas/Music/.git' fatal: Not a git repository: '/home/micas/Music/.git' 0`

Is there a command I can use to show all the uuid of known remotes? I thought I had marked all remotes pointing to /home/micas/Music/.git as `dead`

Is there another reason for the output? How can I get trusted repos back to 0?

**EDIT:**

I removed the folder (was not a git repo at the time of the error) `/home/micas/Music` and the error went away.
