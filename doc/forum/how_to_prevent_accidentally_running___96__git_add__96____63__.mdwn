I fear that while using git annex I will at some point accidentally `git add` some small files and not notice it until the only way to fix the problem is to rewrite history. What would be the best way to prevent myself from ever `git add`-ing a file into my annex repository instead of `git annex add`-ing it?

And secondly, how can I best search in my git annex repository whether I already did this mistake in the past or not? Currently I'm using this which returns everything that's not a symlink or a git submodule:

    git ls-files -s | awk ' $1 != 120000 && $1 != 160000 { print $4 }'
