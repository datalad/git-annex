I don't fully understand what core.preloadindex does, but according to
git's documentation, it's enabled by default. So, it seems pretty safe. :)

Let's anwser the general question: When is a git config tweak not safe to
use with a git-annex repository? Well, git-annex just stores symlinks in
git. And, it maintains a separate git-annex branch with its own data, which
it makes commits to behind the scenes, using its own .git/annex/index file.
Otherwise, a git-annex repo is like any other git repo.

It follows that, unless the git config tweak somehow breaks symlink
support, or somehow breaks git-annex's use of the .git/annex/index file,
the git config tweak should be safe to use with git-annex.

An example of a config tweak that's not entirely safe is to configure
gc.pruneexpire to a very short time period. That could result in git
objects that .git/annex/index refers to being pruned before git-annex can
commit them to the git-annex branch.
