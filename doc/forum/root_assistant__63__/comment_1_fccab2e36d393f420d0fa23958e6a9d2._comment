I would not recommend running the assistant as root. Any security issue
would escalate the root access; any bug could result in some root level
damage to system.

Of course, I don't know of any such security issues or bugs. If I did, I'd
be fixing them.

On my system, /usr/local is managed by group staff. It seems much safer to
make the assistant be run by some non-root user who is in the staff group.
