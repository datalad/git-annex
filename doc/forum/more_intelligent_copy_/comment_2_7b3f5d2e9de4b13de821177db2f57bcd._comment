`git annex copy --fast` has the same behavior as `--not --in REMOTE`

The reason this is not the default behavior is that git-annex's location
tracking information can sometimes be out of date, and then those
two will not copy some files despite their content not being any longer
in the remote. This won't lead to data loss, but could result
in unexpected behavior, and so the slower, more understandable behavior
is used by default. (Although I sometimes go back and forth on switching
it.)
