I don't think you're using a recent version of git-annex, the "(duplicate)"
message has changed to something else a while ago.

Also, that message is only shown if you pass the --deduplicate flag, which
you don't show in your transcript.

That flag does what it says on the tin: If the file is a duplicate of one
git-annex has seen before, the file is deleted from the import location.
(The next version of git-annex does add an additional check that the
content of the file is present in the annex.)
