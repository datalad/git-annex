When you did:

    marshal@home[~/annex]> git-annex copy --auto --to usbdrive

this copies the file content (see .git/annex/objects/*), and updates the metadata in both repos.
The reason why you are not seeing the files on the usb is because the metadata has not been merged into your master branch.
This is verified by the output of:

    marshal@home[/media/marshal/Sony USB/annex]> git-annex sync laptop

To verify that you indeed do have the files and their content, don't do the above sync, but instead do:

    marshal@home[/media/marshal/Sony USB/annex]> git annex merge

the local metadata in the sync/git-annex branch will be merged in, and the local directory will be populated with the new symlinks to the content which you already have in the /media/marshal/Sony USB/annex/.git/annex/objects/*
