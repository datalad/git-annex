Thank you Mesar! 

I think I'm beginning to understand. Indeed, the files were there on the usbdrive repo (in .git/annex/objects). No need to sync or merge. I was able to drop a file from the laptop repo and get it back from the usbdrive.

What is a bit unnerving, is that the symlinks are not present on the usbdrive, so it looks empty except for the .git directory.

Thanks so much for clearing this up. More to explore...
