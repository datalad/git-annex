This is the solution:

	git annex enableremote annexA rsyncurl=host:/new/path

The configremote command changes the configuration of a remote that does
not have to be enabled for use at all, and is currently only used to change
the autoenable=true configuration. For changing other configuration the
enableremote command is the thing to use.
