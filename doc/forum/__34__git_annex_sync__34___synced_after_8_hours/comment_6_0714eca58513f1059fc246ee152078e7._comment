I've just come across something else which has sped up git operations on the index a *lot*.

My $annex/.git/index was over 500M which made operations on the index really slow (git add/rm etc.) as it gets rewritten out in its entirety, every time!

    git update-index --index-version 4

brought it down to 200M, making everything much, much faster!

[There is a warning in the git documentation](http://git-scm.com/docs/git-update-index) that alternative git implementations might not understand it, so bear that in mind if you want to use it.
