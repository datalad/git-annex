*git annex info* has check every file (not sure if it traverses *.git/annex/objects* specifically or not) to get \"local annex\" information. You can improve its performance by improving directory traversal in general (different filesystem or [changing the hashing method so it isn't Xx/Yy/KEY/FILE](https://github.com/datalad/datalad/issues/32)).

The repack/gc speeds up operations for the git side of things, like syncing (pull/push), cloning and committing.

Here's what I used:

    git repack -ad
    git gc

This took git actions down from 1 hour+ to ~10 minutes (for a repo with 5.6 million objects).
