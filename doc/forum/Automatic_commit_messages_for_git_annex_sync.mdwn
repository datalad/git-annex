Not really important (who reads git annex commit messages anyways ;-)), but nice to have and maybe a nice task for someone who wants to play around with Haskell and git annex: It would be shiny if the auto-commit done by git annex sync would automatically create a sensible commmit message and description. E.g. if just one file is added, it could say „Added blubb“. If a few files are added, it could say „Added blubb, bla and n other files“, based on the file name length, and list the files in the long description. Lots of room for playing around :-)
