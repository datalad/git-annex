This bug was fixed in git-annex 3.20120230. You have a few options to get the fix:

* Upgrade to ghc 7.4, the need for which is the cause of the cabal error message you pasted.
* Manually [[download]] from git, and `git checkout ghc7.0` -- that branch will build with your old ghc and has the fix.
* cherry-pick commit 51338486dcf9ab86de426e41b1eb31af1d3a6c87
