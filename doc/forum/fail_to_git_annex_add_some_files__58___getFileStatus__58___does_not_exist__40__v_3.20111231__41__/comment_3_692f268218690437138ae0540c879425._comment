Thank you,

I imagined it was something like that.
I 'm just sorry I posted that on the forum and not on the bugs section (I hadn't discovered it at that time). but now, if people search for this error, they should find this.

Note for Fedora users: unfortunately GHC 7.4 will not be shipped with Fedora 17 (which is still not released). The [feature page](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Features/GHC74) mention it for Fedora 18. I feel like I am using debian ... outdated packages the day of the release.

And many thanks for this wonderful piece of software.

Mildred
