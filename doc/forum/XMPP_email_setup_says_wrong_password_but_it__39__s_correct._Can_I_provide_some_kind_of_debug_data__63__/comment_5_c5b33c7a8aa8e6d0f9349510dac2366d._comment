Hmm, I can't think of anything I've changed that would make it work where it didn't before.

I suspect the google apps problem is because it looks for a SRV record in DNS to find the jabber server, and something is wrong there. Without knowing what \"something@somedomain.com\" is standing for, it's hard to tell. :)

If you'd like to set me up something to test with, my email address is id@joeyh.name
