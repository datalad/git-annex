Hi again!

With the latest version, 3.20121126, pairing works for both something@gmail.com and something@jabber.org! Yay!

What still fails is my google apps address, something@somedomain.com, seems to behave same as before. the assistant says

  Unable to connect to the Jabber server. Maybe you entered the wrong password? (Error message: connect: timeout (Connection timed out))

If you would like a google apps address on my domain, so you don't have to set up your own, just let me know.
