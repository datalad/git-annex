I want to use git-annex to keep track of and archive of large tarballs (on the order of 10 to 100GB each).
One of the locations are a set of external HDDs that are formatted to exFAT.

Unfortunately every git command takes hours to execute.
e.g. every time I use `git status` the index is refreshed which takes about 3 hours, committing a single takes similarly long.

Is there anything I can do to speed things up?
