So there are no ideas on how to proceed from anyone? Was the way I have written this message in any way too complicated or was it for some reason formulated in a manner, that made it look too demanding of others peoples time? I was not intentionally doing so, but I would appreciate any kind of commend on how to better phrase the question or on how to improve it in a way that this issue can be solved. Thanks in advance!

P.S.: Since people probably don't stumble onto this comment, I'll give it another week or so before I would open up a new post containing the same issue.
