The standalone tarball does not need to be installed in /usr/bin or any other particular location. I *never* hardcode /usr/bin in anything.

It seems likely to me that you have not correctly added /opt/git-annex.linux to PATH. You mention `.profile` -- but this is only used
by bash when starting a login shell. So any non-login shells won't have it in path. You need to put something in .bashrc for that.

Also, to use git-annex on a server, there is no reason at all to install the latest and greatest version. Any version 3 or greater build of git-annex will work fine on a server with newer git-annex versions on clients. So `apt-get install git-annex` is a much easier and nicer way to install it on a server. Most linux distributions have a package of git-annex and an easy way to install it.

(It would also help if you pasted actual error messages, rather than a summary of an error message.)
