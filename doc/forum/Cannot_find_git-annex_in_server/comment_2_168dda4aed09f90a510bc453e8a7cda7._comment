I'd rather use the package from the repositories. But this server is running an openSUSE install and the package manager could not resolve the Haskell dependencies of the unofficial git-annex rpm package.

Indeed, performing the PATH extension in \".bashrc\", not in \".profile\", solved the issue. I feel like a newbie. Thanks for the express answer!
