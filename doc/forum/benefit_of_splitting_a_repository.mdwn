I am evaluating the best strategy to use git-annex to manage my media library. It consists of about 300.000 files totaling 1 TB of data.

My question is, wheither it would be of advantage to split the repo into several smaller ones (Like Photos, Videos, Musik, Books, ...)?

Would this affect performance of certain operations? I.e. Operations that have superlinear (O(n^a) with a > 1) complexity?

I am thinking about "git annex unused", which takes 22 minutes on my machine performed on the full repo. 


Do you have more interesting information on using git-annex in this scale?
