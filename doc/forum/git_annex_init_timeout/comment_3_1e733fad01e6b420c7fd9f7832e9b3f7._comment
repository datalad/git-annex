The fix a couple of months ago appears to allow `git annex init` to complete on a SMB file share, which is great.  But FTR there are currently [issues with file transfers](https://git-annex.branchable.com/bugs/SMB__58___git_annex_clone_works__44___get_fails_on_transfer_lock/) (link is to bug report about failing to get transfer lock), so use with a NAS is still \"work in progress\".
