I was able to reproduce the problem with a FAT filesystem
mounted on Linux, if I manually enabled annex.pidlock
before git-annex init. Hard linking does not work on FAT, so that
matches my earlier guess.

I've committed a fix for this, so try again with a recent autobuild of
git-annex and it will probably fix your problem.
