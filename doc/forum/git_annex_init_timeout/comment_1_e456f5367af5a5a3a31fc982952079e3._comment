git-annex needs flock locking to be supported by the filesystem it's used
on. There's a workaround using pid locks, but that is apparently not
working on OSX in your case. I've only tested it on Linux.

I tried reproducing this on OSX by enabling annex.pidlock before using
git-annex. But it worked ok.

So, I suspect there may be a problem with the network filesystem's handling
of the pidlock file. One likely problem is if it doesn't support hard
links, since the pidlock file is hard linked into place.

You can check if it supports hard links by running this on the drive where
you had the problem:

	touch foo
	ln foo bar
