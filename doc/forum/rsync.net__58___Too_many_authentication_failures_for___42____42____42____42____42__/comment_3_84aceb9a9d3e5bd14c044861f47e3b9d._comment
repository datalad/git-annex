I'm running Version: 5.20140318-gdcf93d0. Do I have to install a ssh-askpass manually? I only found one thread referring to ssh-askpass, but didn't really know what to do with that information. So, no I don't have it installed as far as I know... _I_ never did anyway...

Do I need it? Did I miss something in the docs?
