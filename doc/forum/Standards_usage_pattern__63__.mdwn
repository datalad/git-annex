Hi,

I have few devices: 2x android, 2x windows, 2x linux and I would like to share at least one folder on all of them.
None of the devices have public IPs and some regularly change location (work laptops). Because the XMPP support is missing on windows I couldn't find a way to synchronize the repositories (the keys) or did I miss something in the documentation?
How can I archieve "seamless" synchronization when I start the webapp on the devices?

Thank you,
Karol
