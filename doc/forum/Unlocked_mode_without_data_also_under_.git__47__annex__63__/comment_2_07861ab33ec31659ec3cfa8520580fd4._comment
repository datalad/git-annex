In my case, I really don't care about losing the old version of a file.  I have ZFS snapshots and backups to take care of that. I do use thin, and that particular issue doesn't really bother me.  I wounder if a \"superthin\" where there is no hardlinking into .git/annex at all would be possible?  I'm aware that, yes, that could make previous versions unavailable and so forth.
