Sorry, I have again an issue :(

What could be the problem that the webapp is not starting (in Windows)? git annex just exists without messages, connection to localhost failes of course

    me@laptop /cygdrive/c/Data
    $ git annex --verbose --debug webapp
    
    me@laptop /cygdrive/c/Data
    $

If I run it within an annexed directory I get at least one message - but it still immideately exits:

    me@laptop /cygdrive/c/Data/annex
    $ git annex --verbose --debug webapp
    [2014-07-11 19:06:58 Pacific Daylight Time] chat: git-annex ["--verbose","--debug","webapp"]

    me@laptop /cygdrive/c/Data/annex
    $

EDIT:
1.) Interestingly, also "git annex test" fails:

    [...]
    ok
    push origin To C:/Data/.t\repo
       bcc4611..91f5218  git-annex -> synced/git-annex
       6f47922..92c578a  annex/direct/master -> synced/master
    
    ok
    add ../dir2/foo ok
    (Recording state in git...)
    FAIL
          Exception: .t/tmprepo9/.git/annex/journal: getDirectoryContents: permission denied (Access is denied.)

    2 out of 83 tests failed
      (This could be due to a bug in git-annex, or an incompatibility
       with utilities, such as git, installed on this system.)



2.) There's really something very weird going on. At the beginning it worked. Then it stopped (as per above). Sometimes, when I start it using "Git Bash" it works. But then not any more.
3.) Rebooting the machine does not help

EDIT once again:
4.) I am afraid there is something big broken. Suddenly I could start the daemon again. The thing I did was to delete my complete annex.
But if I shutdown the daemon now I get:

    $ git annex webapp
    Launching web browser on file://C:\cygwin\tmp\webapp85796.html
    
      Detected a filesystem without fifo support.
    
      Disabling ssh connection caching.
    
      Detected a crippled filesystem.
    
      Enabling direct mode.
    
    (Recording state in git...)
    WebApp crashed: ExitFailu

... and the whole loop starts again. webapp daemon does not start as long as I delete the annex. Interestingly this is independent from %USERPROFILE%\.config. Deleting this directory does not change anything. So somehow git-annex "knows" that there is somewhere an annex and fails if it is.
