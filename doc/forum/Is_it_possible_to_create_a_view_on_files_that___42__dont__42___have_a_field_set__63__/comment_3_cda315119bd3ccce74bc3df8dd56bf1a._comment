Actually, you can do it without setting the field to a dummy value.

For example, to find all files without an author metadata:

	git annex find --not --metadata 'author=*'

Same switches can be used with other commands, including the metadata
command.

You can also use the git-annex view command to enter a branch that only
contains the files without metadata set:

	git annex view 'author!=*'

(Unfortunately, adding metadata to a file does not currently update this
view branch.)
