I think the forums/website currently is sufficient, I do at times wish there was a mailing list or anonymous git push to the wiki as I find editing posts through the web browser is some times tedious (the lack of !fmt or alt-q bugs me at times ;) ). The main advantage of keeping stuff on the site/forum is that everything gets saved and passed on to anyone who checks out the git repo of the code base.
