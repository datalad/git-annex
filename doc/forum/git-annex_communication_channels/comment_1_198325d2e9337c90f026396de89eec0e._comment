No matter what you end up doing, I would appreciate a git-annex-announce@ list.

I really like the persistence of ikiwiki, but it's not ideal for quick communication. I would be fine with IRC and/or ML. The advantage of a ML over ikiwiki is that it doesn't seem to be as \"wasteful\" to mix normal chat with actual problem-solving.  But maybe that's merely my own perception.

Speaking of RSS: I thought I had added a wishlist item to ikiwiki about providing per-subsite RSS feeds. For example there is no (obvious) way to subscribe to changes in http://git-annex.branchable.com/forum/git-annex_communication_channels/ .

FWIW, I resorted to tagging my local clone of git-annex to keep track of what I've read, already.
