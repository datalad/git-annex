Dear git-annex community, I've just installed git-annex on my CyanogenMod phone. What I'd like to do is to synchronize my music folder from my desktop to my phone. I.e. I'm using [sshelper](http://arachnoid.com/android/SSHelper/index.html) to start OpenSSH server on the phone. The question is, how can I make git and git-annex available to SSHelper's shell so that I can git push to the phone?
