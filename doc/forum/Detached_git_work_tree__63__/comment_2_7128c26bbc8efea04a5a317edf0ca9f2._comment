I'm trying to use git-annex with vcsh, and it doesn't seem to be respecting the GIT_WORK_TREE and GIT_DIR variables vcsh sets. If I try it manually, the same happens.

Any time I try to invoke a git-annex subcommand (init, add) via vcsh (vcsh $repo annex init/add/etc) it spits out an error that \"git-annex: Not in a git repository.\"

I'd really like this to work, so that I can manage the bigger files in my home with topic-based annexes alongside plain-git repos for dotfiles.
