Mm, looking at the actual code changes it may still not work with vcsh - since multiple GIT_DIRS share one GIT_WORKTREE, some symlinks will point to ~/.config/vcsh/repo.d/foo.git and some will point to ~/.config/vcsh/repo.d/bar.git. When git annex is invoked with GIT_DIR='~/.config/vcsh/repo.d/bar.git', with the changes you made files annexed by ~/.config/vcsh/repo.d/foo.git will still match isLinkToAnnex.
