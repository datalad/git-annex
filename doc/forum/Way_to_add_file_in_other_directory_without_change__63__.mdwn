Hi, 
I am trying to use annex, but couldn't find a way. It will be very
helpful if anyone can help.

I have NAS mounted on specific directory /mnt/nas/ 
Suppose whole directory in it is READ-ONLY and keep the file, structure as it is now.

I want to "annex add" files in that directory like 
git annex addurl file:///mnt/nas/a.mp4 

But it seems addurl is only for http/https and "directory special remote" have to change the whole structure of the directory.
Is there any alternative I can try?

Thanks.
