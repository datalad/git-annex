Finally had some time today to lock at the logs. However, I started from scratch. Created a local repo with the assistant, transferred some real files into the local repo dir (not .git of course). Waiting until everything was added etc. Then I created the remote server repo and it immediately started to transfer files from the local repo to the remote. Then I was slightly surprised when I got back home and saw this in the logfile:

This was a total surprise to me. If this was the stuff that made the previous setup fail, I don not know, but I will try to track down this error first. I would be quite surprised if it indeed was a permission issue. Also visible is an upload session for one of the files...that seems to go on fine and is probably not related to the error at all. This was the only error printed once during the entire transfer/sync process. Thought the first thing I would check was the size and number of files in the local and remote directory, but I'm not really sure how to do this with all the git stuff around on the remote. Typically \"git ls-files | wc -l\" or similar gets me going on the local repo. How would I do this on the remote (in backup mode if that counts)?
