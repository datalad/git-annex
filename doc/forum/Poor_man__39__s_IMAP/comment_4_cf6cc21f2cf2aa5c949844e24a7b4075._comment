IMHO It is not the wrong tool for the job, after all the whole point of assistant is to sync folder across machines. I have a similar setup. I have two folders on two machines plus an encrypted repo on an ssh server. On both folders (local/server) i keep webapp running they sync using the encrypted repo/xmpp. The only downside to this approach is that VPS has two copies of every file one in the folder on in the encrypted git repo.
