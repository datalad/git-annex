Now I've found the relevant bug: `http://git-annex.branchable.com/bugs/Can__39__t_add_a_git_repo_to_git_annex:___34__Invalid_path_repo__47__.git__47__X__34___for_many_X`.

Note the symlink workaround near the end.  A quick test shows that it's working great.  I'll try it out for a few months and report back.
