If I use git-annex to keep my home and work computer in sync, the conflict would only happen if I somehow manage to make a change in the git repo on one machine that's not propagated to the other straight away (eg, network down), and I then modify the git repo of the other as well?

Could git-annex have a different merge strategy in this case, not try to merge anything under .git and give a warning?
