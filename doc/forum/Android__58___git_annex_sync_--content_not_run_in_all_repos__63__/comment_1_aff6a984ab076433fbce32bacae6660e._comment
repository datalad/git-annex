It sounds like the android device is sending the files to repository
B-computer, but it is not updating its repository until you run
`git annex sync` manually.

Are you sure that the git-annex assistant is actively managing the `B-computer`
repository? I would `tail -f .git/annex/daemon.log` in that repository 
when making a change to B-android, and see what it does.
