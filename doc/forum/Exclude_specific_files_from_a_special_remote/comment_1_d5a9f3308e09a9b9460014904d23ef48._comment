This is a job for [[preferred_content]]!

For example, you could configure the remote to not want
any flac files, so only mp3, ogg, etc files should be stored on that
remote:

	git annex wanted myremotename 'exclude=*.flac'

This configuration will automatically be honored if you use
`git annex sync --content` (or the assistant). If you manually
use `git annex copy` to copy files to the remote, you'll need to
add the `--auto` flag to make it honor the preferred content settings.
