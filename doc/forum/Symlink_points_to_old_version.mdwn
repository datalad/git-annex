Hello everyone,

I have some PDF documents in a git annex repository. I appended a page to (several) of these PDF documents the following way:

- `git annex edit file.pdf`
- Append page to file.pdf
- `git annex add file.pdf`
- `git commit`

If I now look at file.pdf it will not have the appended page. But if do `git annex edit file.pdf` again I will get the version with the appended page. `git annex add file.pdf` and the page "disappears" again. Anyone got any tips on how to solve this "mystery"?

All the best,
Per
