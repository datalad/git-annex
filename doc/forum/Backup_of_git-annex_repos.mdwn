Hello,

I use CrashPlan, a proprietary offsite backup system to backup a couple of git-annex repositories.

CrashPlan backups the symlinks as symlinks as well as the .git directory. So all data is backuped. However, restoring it tedious.

I identify a file that I want to restore, download it and get only the symlink. Now I can descent into the .git directory and get the correct blob the symlink points to.

Are there any simple strategies getting a specific file from a git-annex repo if you only have file-based view on the repo?

I can, of course, use direct mode, that would resolve this issue, but would prefer to use the safer indirect mode.

Thanks for any ideas!

Best!
