These are pointer files, which are what is stored in git to represent an
unlocked annexed file, rather than the symlink that is stored to represent
a locked file.

You would usually see these if the file's content is not present in the
repository; running `git-annex get` should get it and populate it with the
actual file content.

The "<<<<<<< HEAD" is a git conflict marker; somehow or other you have gotten
two versions of an unlocked annexed file in conflict. This can be resolved the
usual way a git conflict would be resolved, by editing it to contain one
pointer or the other. Or you can run `git-annex resolvemerge` to resolve
the conflict the same way `git-annex sync` does, by checking in both
versions of the file with different filenames.
