Yes, I think that the git-annex-standalone.deb is potentially broken
by mismatches between the system locales and the bundled version of glibc.

The git-annex standalone tarball was designed to be unpacked by the user
who's going to use it; having root install it is not using it as it was
designed. If you're going to have root install something, why not have them
install a docker container or some other container format designed to be
installed by root, that can completely isolate the application inside it?

(As to the getdelim error specifically, here's a link to the thread where
that bug in git was tracked down and patched
<https://public-inbox.org/git/20170810202942.s232yr5stjxmmz4t@hopa.kiewit.dartmouth.edu/>.
I'm still not clear on how locale issues might contribute to the getdelim
error. It seems like something before the getdelim call is failing in this
situation for whatever reason, and that might be the actual root cause.)
