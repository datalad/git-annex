This message about "getdelim" comes from git, not git-annex. It seems
git hash-object is what's running out of memory, and probably
when it's processing its input from stdin.

That's pretty strange. git-annex just passes some filenames to git
hash-object. Unless the system is for some reason very low on memory,
it shouldn't choke on such a small input as a filename.

This seems likely to be a git bug, so what version of git? Perhaps
try a newer one..

(Re: P.S.: It's normal for files in .git/annex/objects to not
have write access.)
