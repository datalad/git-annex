Obviously, Step 3 would only work on remotes that you have control of processes on, but if given login credentials to cloud storage remotes (potentially dangerous!) they could read/write to something like dropbox or rsync.

Another thing, this would be completely trackerless.  You just use remote groups (or create swarm definitions) and share those with your remotes.  It's completely decentralized!
