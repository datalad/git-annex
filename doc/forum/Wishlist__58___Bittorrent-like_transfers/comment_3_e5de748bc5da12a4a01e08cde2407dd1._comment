Personally i think the easiest implementation to make would be smart transfers.

You have a repo on your laptop, and a repo at work. And you have(say) 5 special remotes in between them that they need to use to transfer data.

The laptop could upload 5 different files to those repositories. Wouldn't quite be bittorent transfer(not even close). But it would probably be much simpler to implement. And when syncing a lot of files(instead of just one really big one) the speed gain should really be about the same as if all the special remotes used some kind of bittorent thing.

Just a thought.
