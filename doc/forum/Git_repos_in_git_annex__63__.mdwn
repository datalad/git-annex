Hello,

A mode of operation that I find comfortable, and from various online posts it seems that so do some others, is putting whole git repositories in dropbox.

It seems that currently this mode of operations if not supported in a simple manner. (i.e. just add and let assistant do the work). Is there any workaround or possibility to do this?

Thanks!
