The assistant checks once per day for unused files, and tries to
transfer them to remotes at that point. Exactly when this runs varies,
just once per day sometime. It shouldn't much matter when it runs;
if the drive is not connected at the time, the transfers will fail 
and be remembered to be retried later next time it gets connected.

The webapp will detect if too many unused files are piling up
and will display a message about it.
