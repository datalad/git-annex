You're basically correct. Typically if you have a central machine, it's a server, so at that point you're not pairing, but are just adding a ssh server, or some other type of remote.

I think that systems like AeroFS are pretty neat, but my goal is not really to build another one of those. I'd rather make git-annex be able to use such things as [[special_remotes]].
