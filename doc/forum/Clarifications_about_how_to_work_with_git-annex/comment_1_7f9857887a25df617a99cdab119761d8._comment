Just `git pull` the git-annex branch from remotes yourself like any other
git branch.

git-annex will automatically merge those pulled git-annex branches into its
own local git-annex branch the next time you run it.

Then you can `git push` the git-annex branch to any remotes you want to
publish updated git-annex information to.
