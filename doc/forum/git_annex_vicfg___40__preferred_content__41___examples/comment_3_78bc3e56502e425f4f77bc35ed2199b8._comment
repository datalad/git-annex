I went ahead and used `git annex wanted . \"exclude=FOO\"` and it did what I wanted. For posterity, here are some other observations:

- The file that `git annex vicfg` shows was updated to include the invocation of `git annex wanted`, like this:

```
...(truncated for brevity)...
# Repository preferred contents                                                                                                                                                    
# (Set to \"standard\" to use a repository's group's preferred contents)
# (for k0)
wanted a71d805d-df77-42e7-97b0-ba7686c05083 = exclude=FOO
# (for web)
...(truncated for brevity)...
```

()- I noticed that the UUID above matches the UUID found in my `.git/config` file, which looks like this:

```
[core]
	repositoryformatversion = 0
	filemode = true
	bare = false
	logallrefupdates = true
[remote \"origin\"]
	url = m0:/mnt/a/annex.git
	fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*
	annex-uuid = c5c012cc-2080-481f-81bc-7f449f33490b
[branch \"master\"]
	remote = origin
	merge = refs/heads/master
[annex]
	uuid = a71d805d-df77-42e7-97b0-ba7686c05083
	version = 5
```
