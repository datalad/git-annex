If you're finding vicfg confusing, you don't have to use it; the same
configuration can be done at the command line using `git annex wanted`.
See [[preferred_content]] for documentation.

If you just want to have full control over what files are stored in the
local repository, the easiest way to do that is to run `git annex get` and
`git annex drop` manually when you want or don't want a file's content,
and don't pass --content to `git annex sync`.
