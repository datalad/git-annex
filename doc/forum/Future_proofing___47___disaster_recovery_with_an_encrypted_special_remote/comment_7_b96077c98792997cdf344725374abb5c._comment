I think it's great you're working on this, and [[future_proofing]] is
probably a good place to put the result.

I did some digging, and the cipher used for pubkey includes a trailing
new line. The trailing newline seems to be lost in your script, and
adding it makes it work.

	cipher="$cipher
	"

I think the actual problem in the script is in this line:

	cipher="$(decrypt_cipher "$cipher")"

I verified that decrypt_cipher outputs the trailing newline, but
in capturing its output, the shell chomps it. Can't remember ATM if there's
a way to avoid that in shell scripting.

Arguably git-annex should not be treating that newline as part of the
cipher text, although it's probably too late to change that, certainly for
existing repositories..
