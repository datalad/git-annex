When using `pubkey`, the second 256 bytes of ciphertext are currently
not used for anything.

For `hybrid` and `shared`, the 256 bytes of ciphertext are used
as a symmetric cipher. So the gpg option to use for both encrypting
and decrypting is --symmetric. gpg then prompts for a passphrase,
and the ciphertext is what's used.
