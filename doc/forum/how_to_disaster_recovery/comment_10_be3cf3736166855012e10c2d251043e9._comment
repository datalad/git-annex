The first try at making git-annex ignore the fsck lines about duplicate
entries didn't quite work; the second try landed 8 days ago and it's not
been in a release yet so that's probably why you continue to see the

I don't see how deleting a special remote could lead to this. But we know
that `git annex adjust --unlock` did, for another user.
