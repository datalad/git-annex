Another user reported the same problem. Their repo indeed had a tree object
that contained two items with the same name. In this case, two trees,
with different contents.

	040000 tree cd854aba649cee8855ec72579f4c98100471f7cf    Dokument
	040000 tree 1ae499997746c8e976cf02edc2276532978dafc5    Dokument

This user had been using adjusted branches, which would be my lead suspect.

Original reporter, did you use git-annex's adjusted branches feature.
