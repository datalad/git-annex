Very interesting git fsck output!

It seems like your git repository has somehow gotten a tree object in it
which contains two files with the same name.

While git's data structures allow this, it's pretty nonsensical, and it's
not something that would normally ever happen. It would be interesting to
take a look and see what commits use those tree objects, and where those
strange trees came from.

git-annex in turn is seeing that tree object's sha in the fsck output and
assumes fsck means that the data for that object is broken or missing.
So, I suppose what I'll do is make it skip over lines containing
`duplicateEntries`, and then it won't try to repair this repository.
