So this is mystifying, because this happens for only a single repo out of many that sync between two machines with the git-annex assistant. All other repos sync successfully.

```
Updating fb9c1a7..e5b6add
git-annex filter-process: git-annex: command not found
fatal: the remote end hung up unexpectedly

  realpath: does not exist (No such file or directory)
```

Outbound config:

```
[core]
	repositoryformatversion = 0
	filemode = true
	bare = false
	logallrefupdates = true
	ignorecase = true
	precomposeunicode = true
[remote "mini"]
	url = me@mini:Self/repos/trading-obsidian
	fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/mini/*
	annex-uuid = xxxx
[branch "master"]
	remote = mini
	merge = refs/heads/master
[annex]
	uuid = xxxx
	version = 10
[filter "annex"]
	smudge = git-annex smudge -- %f
	clean = git-annex smudge --clean -- %f
	process = git-annex filter-process
```


I can ssh in and run commands:

```

```

I didn't intentionally configure this repo any differently than any other repo.

For example, the assistant doesn't emit this error for another repo on the same source machine, although I have no idea what a `realpath` is and why this happens in every repo, but this error doesn't seem to be causing the problem.

Any suggestions are appreciated, thanks!
