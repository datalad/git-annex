Thanks for the reply.

I am executing the following commands.

git init main
cd main
git annex init main
echo a > a
git annex add a
git commit -m Initial
git annex unlock a
echo aa > a
git annex add a
git commit -m first
git annex unlock a
echo aaa > a
git annex add a
git commit -m second
git log
git cherry-pick <Hash of first commit>

--------------------
Error: 

error: could not apply 2be8f38... first
hint: after resolving the conflicts, mark the corrected paths
hint: with 'git add <paths>' or 'git rm <paths>'
hint: and commit the result with 'git commit'

How can resolve the the above conflict.
If I see the content of the file I will get the content of second commit.
Is there any way I can get the content for first commit(Like in git we have 'theirs' option.)

Thank you.
