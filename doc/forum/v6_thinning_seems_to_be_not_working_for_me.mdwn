copied a big file to the working directory

git add
git commit


Locking the big file creates the symlink, with the file in the annex.

Unlocking the big file creates a real file in the working dir, and the annex file stays there.

The total dir is therefore twice the size of the big file.

ls -li shows a unique inode for each file.


It seems thinning is not doing what I expected:

Which is: unlocking a file creates a hard link in the working directory, linked to the annex file, with
the resulting dir size being the size of the one big file.

Are my expectations correct?

Is there something I am missing?
