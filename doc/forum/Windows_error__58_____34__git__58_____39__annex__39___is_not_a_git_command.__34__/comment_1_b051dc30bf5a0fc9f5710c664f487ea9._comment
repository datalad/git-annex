Please make sure you have Git For Windows, and the current version
5.20150916 
of git-annex installed. msysgit is no longer supported, and any
older version of git-annex won't work with Git For Windows.

Since you mention git-annex.exe in the cmd directory, I guess
you probably have an old version installed. The current version
does not put that file there.
