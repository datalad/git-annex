I have the same error. Fresh git 2.37.0 and git-annex 10.20220526.

Looks like adding `c:\Program Files\Git\usr\bin` to `PATH` can fix the issue for me.

IIRC, Git for Windows asks during installation whether to add all tools to the PATH or just the main ones.
And I prefer just the main tools, since I have separate iconv, GPG etc. installations.

Is there any reason why git-annex is installed in Git dir? Why doesn't it use its own?
If separate dir is not an option then I propose to add to `git-annex.cmd`:

```
@echo off
setlocal
set PATH=%~dp0..\usr\bin;%PATH%
```

`git annex` still won't work, but `git-annex` will.
