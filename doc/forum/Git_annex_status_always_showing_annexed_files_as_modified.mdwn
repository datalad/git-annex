Hi,

Whenever I sync files with windows, it shows the every binary file as modified. I've just cloned "fresh" repo from a linux host and ```git annex get```ed the 15-11-03 folder.
Running git annex status 15-11-03 shows

```

```

Edit: I should add that this repo is untrusted. Doing sync on it just ends up pulling from remotes, not pushing anywhere:

```
Î» git annex sync
commit  (recording state in git...)
ok
pull origin
ok
pull github
ok
```

How would I check if this is a problem with my installation or a bug in git annex?
