This is a common gotcha; bash sources something like .bashrc
or whatever that puts /usr/local/bin/ in your path when it's a login shell.
However, when git-annex is sshing in, there is no login shell,
and bash does not source any dotfiles, and so git-annex-shell in not in
PATH.

The solution is probably to move or symlink it to some other directory
that is in PATH always.
