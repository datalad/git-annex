Well, it does look like your git-annex did not pass the port to the second command. 

What version are you using? I've just tested with a ssh server only listening on 2222 and it used the port throughout.

You might try upgrading to a recent version. I know that version 4.20130627, at least, had a bug with the ssh port.
