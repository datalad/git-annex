You can edit files that use the WORM backend, as long as the editing changes their size or mtime, or both. If neither changes, git-annex won't be able to keep your edits separate when using WORM.

A perhaps safer compromise can be to use the WORM backend initially, but them `git annex migrate --backend=SHA256E` when you have spare CPU cycles. 

Or, when you commit a change to a file that had been using WORM, use `git annex add $wormy_file --backend=SHA256E` to make the new version use the better backend.
