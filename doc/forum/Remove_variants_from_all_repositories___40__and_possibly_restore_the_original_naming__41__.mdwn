I, by mistake, added some files directly to the remote locations and my local repository, afterwards, using `git annex get '*'` to get "all" the new files from the remotes I created some `file.variant-xxxx.ext` files. For me this is undesirable. I'm sure the files are almost the same (I'm presuming some metadata got changed, they are audio files) so I want to remove one keeping the other and removing the `variant-xxxx` string. Is there a way this is possible without manually drooping/renaming all these files?
