After moving some files (about 1G, some big and some small files) in and out the annex, I noticed that the size of the repository has grown quite a bit. My empty repository now is over 100 MB (even after  "git annex dropunused ..." and "git gc").

Most of this size is not Git metadata but many small files in the git-annex branch that seem to hold information about files I deleted (even in the other known repositories).

So is there a way to get rid of these useless but space consuming information?

(Maybe there is no (elegant) way to remove the symlink versions from the Git history (is there?), but it would already be nice if those small git-annex metadata files could be removed)
