git-annex can only share the contents of files with a friend when you both have access to a transfer repository. Your friend's git-annex webapp should detect that it does not have such a repository, and should be displaying an alert like this:

(But in this case it should say \"Unable to download files from YourName\")

So, you need to give your friend access to the S3 repository that you're already using to keep your 2 computers in sync. Or, set up some other transfer repository that you both can access.

There is a way in S3 to create another key that can read and write to a S3 bucket. You can then give that key to your friend.

Or, you could set up a shared git repository on a ssh server you both have access to. Or, set up a box.com remote -- the webapp will offer to store the box.com credentials and share them with your friend.
