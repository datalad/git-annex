Since version 5.20140517, the git-annex assistant will automatically clean up stale tmp files on startup.

If not using the assistant, you can do it yourself..

So far, all the tmp files people have been kind enough to share the details about with me seem to be created by the assistant when it locks a file down. I know this can result in dangling files if the computer is rebooted while the assistant is in the middle of doing that.
