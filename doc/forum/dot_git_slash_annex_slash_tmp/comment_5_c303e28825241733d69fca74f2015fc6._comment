Oh, another stupid thing I might have done -- 

* added files to the repo, and not realizing it might take assistant a while to recognize and add them all, gotten impatient
* added them myself, but did it with \"import\" instead of \"add\" so I was git-annex importing files from *inside* git-annex, with an assistant process running at the same time.

Might not be relevant, just trying to think of weird things I've done.
