They're the full actual filenames (but not directories) of particular files in my repository, sometimes with numeric suffixes (or rather, numbers before the file suffixes), like this:

746.DS_Store
747.DS_Store
748.DS_Store
749.DS_Store

Handlebars (fan video)87713.mp4
Handlebars (official)87712.mp4
Handlebars (official)87713.mp4
