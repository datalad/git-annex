that's odd... these files are on my client machine, and shouldn't be downloaded from anywhere, just uploaded to other places.  There are lots and lots of them.

git-annex unused only found two files, and there are dozens and dozens of these files in my .git/annex/tmp directory.  

Would it be safe to delete them by hand?

(The only thing I can think of that might e relevant is, some of these have definitely been moved from place to place within my repo.  I use \"git mv\" when I do that.  Maybe I messed that up somehow, and git-annex thought they had disappeared and needed to be re-downloaded from a remote repo?)
