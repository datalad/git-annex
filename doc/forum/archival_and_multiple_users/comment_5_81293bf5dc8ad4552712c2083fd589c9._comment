I think i agree that this should be implemented.

Not only to be able to \"get/drop\" from the assistant without the use of archive folders.

But mainly because i think this will be needed anyways, to do a \"recover previous version of file\" option. Which should definitely be in the web assistant.

We can't expect family and friends to figure out all command line stuff, thus they need to use the assistant. And i really think it would be a shame to not have an easy way to recover old versions, when the old versions are actually stored.

Always think about having a good WAF(Wife acceptance factor).

Just my 2 bits (and a haircut).
