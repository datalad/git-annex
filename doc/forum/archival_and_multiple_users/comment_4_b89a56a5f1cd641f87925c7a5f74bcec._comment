Moving files shouldn't jepardize anything. If a user makes a change they shouldn't have made, it can be reverted.

If you have the archive drive available locally you can set your repository to manual mode and just use `git annex get` on content you want. Or you could set it to be a backup repository and the assistant would get all content.
Or write a custom [[preferred_content]] expression for your repository to make it want files in `archive/stillusing/`
