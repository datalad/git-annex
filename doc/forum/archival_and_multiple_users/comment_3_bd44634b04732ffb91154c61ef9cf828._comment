> The way to handle this situation is to copy or move the files you want out of the archive directory, and back to the parent directory. This move of the file will be synced from your repository to all the other repositories. When the repository that does have access to the archive notices this, it will get the files that have been moved out of the archive. Normal assistant syncing will then arrange to get them transferred back to the repository of the user who had wanted them.

But won't it also transfer the same files into repos of all other users (who didn't want the files)?
On a related note, allowing moving files for everyone could jeopardise integrity of the master archive.  Is there a way to limit what kind of ops the users can do (e.g. copy but not move)?

Re offline drives, the case I was thinking of is actually where each user has access to e.g. special remotes directly.  So a manual get/put would solve the problem at hand.
