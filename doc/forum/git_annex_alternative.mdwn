I really like git-annex and am thankfull to its creator!

I especially like the high level of abstraction it provides when handling backups or syncing.

But git and my ext4 filesystem and HDD just hate the amount of files/folder/symlinks it throws at them and I am asking, what the alternatives are. I am especially looking for the numcopies and "--auto" functionallity. 


Most alternatives I checked out (eps. distributed redundant filesystems) come up with other burdens or restrictions.

Do you have any experience with different systems?
