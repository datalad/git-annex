Took a look at hook script line endings on windows, and found that they
work both with CRLF endings and without the CR.

It seems better to not use CR in them, because git for windows does not
in the examples it writes, and because it will make the hooks portable if
the repository gets moved to a unix system.

So, I made `git-annex init` omit the CR when writing new hook scripts.
Existing hook scripts that use CRLF will be preserved by git-annex.

I have not been able to reproduce this problem with or without CR in hook
scripts:

	fatal: cannot run hooks/post-receive: No such file or directory
