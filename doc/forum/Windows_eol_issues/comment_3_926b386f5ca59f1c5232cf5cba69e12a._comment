I would not be concerned about the contents of the mergedrefs file, since
it is only an optimisation and at worst git-annex does a little extra work
re-merging a branch it has already merged.

I've fixed this in [[!commit eb42935e5822a43ec29c1c113d5df62ea676d119]].
Several log files were affected as detailed in the commit, but it seems
nothing really broke, only some optimisations were prevented from working,
luckily.

Also I checked git commands on windows and nothing I tried output CRLF to
stdout on windows. So I've made git-annex follow suite, and disabled
NewlineMode for stdout.
