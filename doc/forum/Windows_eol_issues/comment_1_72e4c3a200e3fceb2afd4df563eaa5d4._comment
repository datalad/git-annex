The .git/annex/mergedrefs problem seems to indicate that `git show-ref` is
outputting lines ending with CRLF. That's surprising to me, I thought git
commands on Windows didn't output CRLF at least when piped.
Can you show the output of that command fed through `cat -vet` please?

In retrospect it would be better if annex pointer files did not end in a
newline at all. It's not really necessary that they do, and that would
avoid git for windows from messing with their content when merging them
from elsewhere. However, AFAIK git-annex manages to not break despite git
doing that to its pointer file, by ignoring CR in pointer files
(see [[!commit 4d89a1ffd1b4bfd423c11c9e703e9d2fb0f5fb25]]). 
So I'm not sure what problem you're demonstrating with that example merge?

git-annex list is displaying CRLF for the header because it uses putStrLn
for it, and putStrLn on Windows uses CRLF by default (due to the default NewlineMode
on Windows). Then for the file list it uses ByteString.Char8.putStrLn, which does
not use CRLF. Since those two are generally seen as equivilant and code is
often switched between them to improve performance, it would be a real
ongoing pain point to remember this gotcha. This makes me think that
git-annex on windows ought to `hSetNewlineMode stdout noNewlineTranslation`
so it consistently outputs without CRLF.

About the CRLF in the hooks, I know it's been discussed somewhere before,
but I can't remember where. IIRC there were some complexities involving
what the bash bundled with git expected to find.
