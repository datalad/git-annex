Thanks joey for your response. And thank you for jkniiv for providing the output to git show-head, it matches what I see.

With regards to the pointer file... I think the problem I have with it is.. well, first the avoidable warning:

[[!format  sh \"\"\"
warning: in the working copy of 'ntdll.dll', LF will be replaced by CRLF the next time Git touches it
\"\"\"]]

I guess also, because git-annex doesn't honour (??) git's actual expectations on line mode, you end up with git thinking a file is modified. Because git knows it as text, and in the default mode under Windows, it expects the text file to be CRLF.

Also... I guess in a way, once Windows has acted on a file that came from unix, it now becomes a pointer file on disk. You can't get the benefit of the symlink to view the contents.

Also also... I don't think I demonstrated it here, but I found that eventually, some merge would cause the line-ending to flip, and then there would be another unnecessary checkin of the pointer file.

Sorry if this is all a bit abstract. I was working on large repos, oblivious to some of what I found and have pasted above, and was filling in the \"bitmap\" of my knowledge piecemeal.

With the CRLF hooks, yes, I originally reported that. So in the above, not how I do a push msw to wsl only, and no pull from msw at wsl. That's because that type of pull would break, with the wsl/linux system() call interpreting the CR as part of the shebang, and being unable to execute the shell itself.
