I recently started to set up a share that would be synced between multiple machines.  Since I control all of them I thought it might be cool to try using the suggested "shared encryption".  This seems to have been a mistake.

My project folder is now a big mess of symlinks to read-only files.  

I can fix this with a "cp -RH" and get my data back and I can muddle through fixing the permissions but this leads me to two conclusions:

1.  I did something wrong but I don't know what.  Should I have created the ssh remote first and the local repo second?  

2.  This feature should either be hidden or the UI should be much more explicit about how to use it properly.  This cost me quite a bit of time and frustration.

I really like git-annex so I would appreciate any comments or suggestions.
