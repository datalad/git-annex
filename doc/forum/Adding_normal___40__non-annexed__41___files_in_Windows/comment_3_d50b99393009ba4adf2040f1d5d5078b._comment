One nice way to do this is to use the annex.largefiles configuration
setting. With a recent version of git-anne (5.20150409 or newer),
adding a file that doesn't match annex.largefiles will cause it to be
checked into git, rather than annexed.

So, for example, `git -c annex.largefiles='exclude=*' annex add foo`
will temporarily configure it to not annex any files, and add file foo to
git. Or you can set annex.largefiles more permanantly to match specific
file extensions.

As to the annex/direct/master branch, this branch will get merged into the
master branch on a push, so don't worry about it.

(The `-c core.bare=false` approach will also work, just run regular git
commands to add the file and commit. But, it's best to avoid this approach,
because it's very easy to shoot yourself in the foot, by eg using
`git commit -a` with it, which will check *all* file contents into git.)
