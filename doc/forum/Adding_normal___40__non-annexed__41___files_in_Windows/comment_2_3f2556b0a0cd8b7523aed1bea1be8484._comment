if I use `git annex proxy` I can't see the changes:

    C:\Users\Chris\Projects\testing>git annex proxy -- git status
    On branch annex/direct/master
    nothing to commit, working directory clean

and I noticed that I'm on a branch called `annex/direct/master`, not the `master` I'd expect...

if I use `git -c core.bare=false`, I get the normal output:

    C:\Users\Chris\Projects\testing>git -c core.bare=false status
    On branch annex/direct/master
    Untracked files:
      (use \"git add <file>...\" to include in what will be committed)
    
            test.txt
    
    nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use \"git add\" to track)

but I'm still on a \"wrong\" branch? what is this `annex/direct/master` branch and am I supposed to commit and push this branch?

Thanks, Chris
