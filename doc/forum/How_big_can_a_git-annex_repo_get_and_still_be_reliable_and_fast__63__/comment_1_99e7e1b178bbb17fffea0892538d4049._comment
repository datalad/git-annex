It can actually get really big and still be okay to use, if you follow the [tips page for annexs with lots of files](/tips/Repositories with large number of files).

Mine is still reasonably responsive at 10 million files! Iterating over it all (git annex info, deduping) is really painful though, but it'd be like that without git-annex..
