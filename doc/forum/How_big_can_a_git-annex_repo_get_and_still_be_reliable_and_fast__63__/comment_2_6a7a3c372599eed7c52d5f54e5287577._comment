Depending on the total size of the small files, you might consider a mixed
repo, with the small files checked into git normally, and the larger files
annexed. 

The advantage is that you then don't need to use git-annex commands to
manage the many small files. This will probably be faster, for except you
won't need to `git annex get` a ton of small files, which will avoid a lot
of overhead.

Of course, if you have gigabytes of small files, that will result
in a git repo gigabytes in size, and you will start to run into some of the
scalability problems that git-annex addresses.
