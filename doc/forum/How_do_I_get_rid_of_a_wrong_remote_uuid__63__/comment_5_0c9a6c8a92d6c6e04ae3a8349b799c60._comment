Thanks, it worked!

Regarding how I got into that state, here is what happened:
- I configured a new repository (git init, git annex init) on machine B
- I added that repository as a remote from machine A
- I started pushing files from machine A to machine B, starting with the file that later showed this problem
- I then noticed that, although the files were said to be successfully sent, I could not see them on machine B (no symbolic link was created), even after a \"git annex sync\" there
- I decided to start over, deleting the annex, and creating it from a clone of an existing annex
- This resulted in a duplicated UUID for the same path, which led to this problem

Maybe some documentation on how to cleanly start over when things get in a bad state would be very useful.

Thanks again,

Alan
