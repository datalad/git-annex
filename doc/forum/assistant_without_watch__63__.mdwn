"watch" is described as

> With this running as a daemon in the background, you no longer need to manually run git commands  when  manipulating your files.

and "assistant" is described as

> Like watch, but also automatically syncs changes to other remotes.

I would like the behaviour of assistant, without the watch part:

I have an archive of large files, which I think would be useful to manage manually using git.  But I don't want to manually enforce the "numcopies=" requirement, playing with the assistant and webapp it seems really nice to have it take care of that.

Is there currently an "assistant-without-watch" option?   If not, is it planned?
