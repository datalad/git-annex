There are SSH keys in ~/.ssh to a remote server that I added as a git annex remote. On my Debian box, I am able to `git annex copy` and `git annex move` to and from the remote to a local repo at `~/archive` with no problems. I also have no problems with external USB drives formatted ext4. 

I have an external usb drive formatted NTFS that I connect to a Debian box. I added the remote server like the others and when I try to copy or move to and from it, this error code shows up.

    Please make sure you have the correct access rights
    and the repository exists.

I think it is because of NTFS and the ssh key stored in `~/.ssh`, but I don't know what is going on. 

Thanks!
