I have several TB of media on a Debian ZFS server. If I created a git-annex repo for the data, how hard would it be get git-annex (using bup I assume) to back up the files onto a set of Blu Ray disks? I realize that 8TB of data would take about 320 BR 25GB disks, but it seems like git annex would be great for identifying what disk(s) I needed to recover a file. I'm good at bash scripting, and use git daily. I have no experience with git-annex or bup however. Any links to information or suggestions is very appreciated. Thanks!
