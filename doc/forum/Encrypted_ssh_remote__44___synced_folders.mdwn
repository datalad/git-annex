Hello,

I hope my understanding of the git-annex webapp is correct, and if not, please correct my wrong thought-pattern.

I have 2 VPS servers and 5 computers. On the 5 computers, I want to sync one folder (with subfolders and files). All the computers are full-disk encrypted, and it is important for me that when the data leaves my computer, it stays encrypted in one way or another. I want to use the two VPS's as an encrypted ssh full backup repository.

The computers are rarely on at the same time, some are off for two weeks, others are on more frequent. However, the VPS's are always on.

Now, is it possible to set up git-annex to support this behaviour? Using an encrypted ssh remote to make sure the folder is in sync on all computers? 

I've set git-annex up on one box, with the two servers as encrypted full backup remotes (without git-annex installed there), and configured my jabber account. That all works, and the files get synced.

Then I've set up a second computer, while the first one is still on. There I've added my jabber account, and created a local repository. Then I selected "Share with your other devices". It now shows my jabber account on both machines, and I saw a few syncing messages, but then there came errors, "Unable to download files from your other devices". I've attached the log at the bottom of this page.

It gives me the option to add a Cloud Repository. If I add the encrypted rsync full backup remote VPS there, will it work and keep my files in sync? is there something I'm doing wrong?

Note that the computers I've set up now are two OS X machines running Mountain Lion, and the servers are CentOS 6.
