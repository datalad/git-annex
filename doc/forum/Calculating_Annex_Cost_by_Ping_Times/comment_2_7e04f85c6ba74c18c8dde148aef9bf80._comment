Yeah, I was debating between ping times (max or avg) and hop count and ultimately went with ping time because of this situation: From my office to my house is ~12 hops but because we peer with the cable modem provider the ping time is still ~5ms. But from my cell modem, it's ~8 hops but ping times of ~200ms.
