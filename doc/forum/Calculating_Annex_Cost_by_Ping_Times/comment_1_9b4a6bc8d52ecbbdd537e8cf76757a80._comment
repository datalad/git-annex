You may want to use hop count, not ping times, for a rough guesstimate of distance.

Generally speaking, this is a highly non-trivial problem that's subject to university research projects so unless you find a well-maintained third party tool to solve this problem, it's unlikely that you will find a truly general solution.

Anyway, look into mtr for your distance measurements.
