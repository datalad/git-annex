additional filter criteria could come from the git history:

* `git annex get --touched-in HEAD~5..` to fetch what has recently been worked on
* `git annex get --touched-by chrysn --touched-in version-1.0..HEAD` to fetch what i've been workin on recently (based on regexp or substring match in author; git experts could probably craft much more meaningful expressions)

these options could also apply to `git annex find` -- actually, looking at the normal file system tools for such tasks, that might even be sufficient (think `git annex find --numcopies-gt 3 --present-on lanserver1 --drop` like `find -iname '*foo*' -delete`

(i was about to open a new forum discussion for commit-based getting, but this is close enough to be usefully joint in a discussion)
