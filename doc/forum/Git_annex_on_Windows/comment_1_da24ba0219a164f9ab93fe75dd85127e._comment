Are you able to run git commands? IIRC msysgit prompts when it's installed about whether you want to put it in the path or not. git-annex just piggybacks on this path setting. It is installed in the same folder as the git.exe and should work as long as that is in path.
Otherwise, consult windows documentation to add git-annex to the path, or you can copy the git-annex.exe to somewhere else I suppose.

I built a clean Windows system yesterday and have just re-tested it and it does work.
