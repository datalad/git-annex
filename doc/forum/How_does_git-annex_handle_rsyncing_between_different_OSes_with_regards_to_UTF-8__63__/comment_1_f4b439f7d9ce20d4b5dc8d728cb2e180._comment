Both git and git-annex both treat filenames as strings of bytes, with no
particular encoding, to the extent supported by the OS[1]. This may result
in a checkout of git repository having filenames that don't display well on
a different system.

[1] Of course any reasonable Unix treats filenames like that too.. but
Windows only supports unicode filenames.
