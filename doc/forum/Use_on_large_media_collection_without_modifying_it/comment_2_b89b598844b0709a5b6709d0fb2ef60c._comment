Thank you for these thoughts!

I should have mentioned that I intend the USB drives to often live offsite, so they would be disconnected.  You are quite correct, though, that if they are onsite I could think of them as the sort of \"hub\" repository and do everything from them like that.

Doing the enableremote for the special directory remote on the laptop does require it to be mounted as a filesystem there, hence my mention of sshfs.  That can work but is a bit clunky.
