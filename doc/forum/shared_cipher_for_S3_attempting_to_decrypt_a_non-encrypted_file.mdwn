I am trying to S3 as a file store for git annex. I have set up the remote via the following command:

    git annex initremote xxx-s3 type=S3 encryption=shared embedcreds=yes datacenter=EU bucket=xxx-git-annex fileprefix=test/

The remote gets set up correctly and creates the directory I want, and adds a annex-uuid file.

Now when I try to copy a file to the xxx-s3 remote, I get the following error:

    $ git annex add ssl-success-and-failure-with-tl-logs.log 
    add ssl-success-and-failure-with-tl-logs.log ok
    (Recording state in git...)
    $ git annex copy ssl-success-and-failure-with-tl-logs.log --to xxx-s3
    copy ssl-success-and-failure-with-tl-logs.log (gpg) gpg: no valid OpenPGP data found.
    gpg: decrypt_message failed: eof

    git-annex: user error (gpg ["--batch","--no-tty","--use-agent","--quiet","--trust-model","always","--batch","--passphrase-fd","10","--decrypt"] exited 2)
    failed
    git-annex: copy: 1 failed

Any ideas what might be wrong? Is shared cipher broken somehow?
