It is not possible to recover just from a special remote. You need at least one copy of the git repository. This drive doesn't need to carry around the actual payload.
Consider using an encrypted thumb drive as an additional destination. You can even fully encrypt this repo and sync it up once in a while to keep the information up to date.
You can have a look at [[tips/fully_encrypted_git_repositories_with_gcrypt]] for detailed information.
