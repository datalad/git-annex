I think I have tracked down part of the issue. It due to the options that are called by `git-annex` when trying to `rsync` between the NTFS local hard drive and the SSH remote. 

I got `rsync` to work by using `rsync -vrc source dest` as options (outside of git-annex). Found [here](http://askubuntu.com/questions/112863/rsync-not-working-between-ntfs-fat-and-ext).

Is there any way to change the rsync options put out by git-annex when copying/moving to and from local ntfs drives on linux?
