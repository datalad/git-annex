This control socket message sounds like the actual problem is
that unix sockets cannot be used on this filesystem. git-annex
puts the socket there to make ssh connection caching work.

So, I think you need to disable ssh connection caching: 
`git config annex.sshcaching false`

I was able to reproduce a similar failure on nfts on linux.
