I wish this incompatibility didn't exist either, but the transition to use
consistently 3 letter hash directories would be too much to ask of all the
users. And there are ways to convert a bare to non-bare that don't have
this problem, like making a clone and using `git annex move --all --from
origin`

There's an easy way to finish your conversion from bare to non-bare.
Just move .git/annex/objects to old-objects, and run `git annex add
old-objects --backend=SHA256`. That will rename all the files into the right places for a
non-bare repository, so your existing symlinks will work. You can then
`rm -rf old-objects` to clean up.

Note that method assumes that SHA256 is the backend of everything in that
repo. If not, it gets a bit trickier; you'd need to use `git-annex
setkey'
