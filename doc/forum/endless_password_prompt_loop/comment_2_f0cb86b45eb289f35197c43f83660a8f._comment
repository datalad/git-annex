Thanks for the answer. I found out that the public key auth is not working at all and ssh falls back to password auth, this is the reason for password prompts. What I don't know yet is why popups appear despite giving correct password. I'm looking for a solution. This can take some time though because my disk died few days ago = I cannot check versions. Once I've got it solved I'll post back.
