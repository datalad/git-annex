hello,

I experience the same behaviour : once git-annex is started using the assistant, the ssh askpass window keeps asking me for a password. 
The repo is not reachable at this time (the server is down).

What's really annoying is that the askpass window is sometimes hidden behind other windows, but it keeps grabbing keyboard events: it looks like the keyboard \"does not work\" anymore. Hopefully pressing escape shuts closes askpass.

The askpass window still pop ups from time to time even once the assistant has been closed.

Running git-annex version 5.20141125  on Debian (amd64) on jessie.
