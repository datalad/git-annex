It seems like that is how [OSX stores symlinks on FAT filesystems](https://opensource.apple.com/source/msdosfs/msdosfs-185.2/msdosfs.kextproj/msdosfs.kmodproj/fat.h?txt) and how [Samba stores symlinks on Windows](https://wiki.samba.org/index.php/UNIX_Extensions#Storing_symlinks_on_Windows_servers).  Did you initially make the drive on one of those systems?  Using the same system again would probably make them appear like normal usable symlinks.

At the very least, since you said `.git/annex` is full of data, I think you should be able to find the photo at the location listed in the last line of those files:

```
../.git/annex/objects/5F/Xw/SHA256E-s2499217--ad9525adf9a82e4ac83c89fd2bddfd2b2aef690ccbbddf38d91abc85f72509f6.jpg/SHA256E-s2499217--ad9525adf9a82e4ac83c89fd2bddfd2b2aef690ccbbddf38d91abc85f72509f6.jpg
```
