Thanks for the info, that was very helpful. This is indeed a FAT partition I created on OSX.

Unfortunately, I no longer use OSX, so I don't have a machine that can read this data. I'll write a script to grab it from the contents of the symlink file itself to hopefully retrieve everything. In the future, I'll partition my external harddrives with ext4 :)

Thanks again!
