The usual fix for this kind of problem is to use direct mode for your
git-annex repository.

Direct mode is actually the default if you use the webapp to create your
repository. Otherwise, you can stop the assistant running, and run "git
annex direct" to convert the repository to direct mode, then start the
assistant back up.
