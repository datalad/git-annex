That is a pretty weird error message! It looks like git-annex may have run
git but tried to pass it a working directory that does not exist. It would
be interesting to know what git command, passing --debug would tell you.

But: The gcrypt special remote is documented as needing gitrepo=rsync:// to
operate over ssh. And git-remote-gcrypt interprets a rsync:// url as rsync
over ssh (see its man page). Yes, "host::" in rsync indicates direct contact
to a rsync daemon, not using ssh, but that will not work with git-remote-gcrypt
to the best of my knowledge.
