`git-annex metadata` only works on annexed files. Your `testfile` is
checked into git directly, so these git-annex commands silently skip
it, the same as `git annex whereis` will.

There's some chance this could change.. It would be kind of nice,
for git-annex's metadata to be able to be applied to regular files
in the git repository.
