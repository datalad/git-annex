The easiest method seems to be to force-push git-annex and master to other remotes, e.g.

    git push -f myremote git-annex:refs/heads/git-annex

Before doing this, make sure location logs etc had a chance to propagate across all remotes.

It's a good idea to remove synched/ branches before doing git-annex sync on the repos with rewritten history, too:
    git branch -D synced/master
    git branch -D synced/annex
