Very quick one, if anyone has to share experience with views (i would find them useful to get partial checkout views, as long as I can find a special setup to preserve the tree/filenames hyerarchy): 

by using (filtering) views I am getting file names changed to include the (orignal) dir name,
for instance:

2008/pippo.doc

after a git annex view 2008/=*, comes out as pippo_%2008%.doc
is this avoidable ?

(i've been trying to follow metadata walkthrough etc. but i always get the dirname in the filename between percents...)

btw: version is 5.20141105
