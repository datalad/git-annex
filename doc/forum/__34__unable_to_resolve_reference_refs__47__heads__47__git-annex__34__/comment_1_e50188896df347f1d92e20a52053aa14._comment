I'm afraid that this looks like a partially corrupted git repository to me. Something seems to have gone wrong with `.git/refs/heads/git-annex`. Also, git object d768b20f76ce40157214a713fb0ccb9cfc9134c2 seems to have been present before, and be gone now. 

I would run `git fsck`, then look at what's happened in `.git/refs/heads`, and if the repository does seem to be damanged, re-clone it. (You can copy over `.git/config` and `.git/annex/` to keep your annexed data in the new clone.) You should probably also run `git annex fsck`, as it could have lost some location log changes.
