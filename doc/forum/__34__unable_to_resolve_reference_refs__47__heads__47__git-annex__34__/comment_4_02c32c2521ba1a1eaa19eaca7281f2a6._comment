I didn't think that git would let corruption spread either, but it did: the repository m3 which I showed a push to in my original post showed a broken refs/heads/git-annex too.  You can see it happening when git tries to repack m3 after pushing to it in my original post.

I am pretty sure that my HDD on the machine where this first occurred needs replacing; I've marked the remote as untrusted.
