1. I don't understand how corruption could spread between git repositories. git is supposed to use checksums to prevent bad data propigating. I would be running a lot of `git fsck` if I were you. Yes, `git annex fsck` will update location log information for files it finds in the local repository.

2. Again this looks like something is corrupting your repository when git writes it. Perhaps bad memory? I think you need to get to the root of the problem with the corrupting git repositories.
