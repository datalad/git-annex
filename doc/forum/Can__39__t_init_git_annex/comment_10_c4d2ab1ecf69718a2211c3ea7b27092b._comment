If you need a git repository with your regular file names on the smb share, none of the special remotes will meet your needs. You'd need to find a way to make it support POSIX locking to use git-annex on it in a full git repository.

But I think that in most cases a directory special remote on such a share, with the git repository kept locally and git-annex used to pull files down to it as needed, would work ok.
