OK;  The reason i ask about `git annex sync` is because I had previously copied the large files onto `smb://` before setting up the `annex` and don't want to unnecessarily transfer large data over Internet again.  But now if i do `git annex copy --to smb`, and check what's added/changed in `smb` end, i found 
 
    $ cd /Volumes/subproject
    $ ls
    091		383		bigdir1    bigfile1  ...

The files with numbers in names such as`091`, `383` are being added, the `bigfile1` and `bigdir1` are the ones previously copied there.  What are those `091`, `383` etc.
