The smb:// is a red flag to me. git-annex relies on POSIX file locking, and I'll bet smb does not provide that, or, perhaps, your samba server needs a configuration change to support it.

You might consider putting your git annex repository on the local filesystem, and setting up a [[special_remote|special_remotes]] on smb. The [[special_remotes/directory]] special remote is a likely choice.
