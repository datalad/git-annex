That's where it stores files in the directory special remote. You can move the similar contents of /Volumes/subproject/.git/annex/objects/ to the same place as those and then run `git annex fsck --from smb --fast` and it'll learn about those files you already transferred.

You probably also want to delete /Volumes/subproject/.git afterwards, and any git working tree that was checked out there before; the directory special remote does not use the git repository that you had there before.
