OK;   The purpose of putting files on the remote `smb://` partition is to publish these big data files, so other (potentially non-technical) people can download and use them.  They'll not be willing to learn how to use git, let alone git-annex.  And i have multiple development machines that can generate revisions/updates to these big files.  I previously just rsync from/to various development machines to/from this smb partition, but i find sometimes I don't always srync in correct direction.  The hope is i can have annex on these development machines, and set the smb:// partition as the remote for these git annex.    But it sounds like none of the special remote will have the original form, and a normal remote is not possible on smb:// partition.
