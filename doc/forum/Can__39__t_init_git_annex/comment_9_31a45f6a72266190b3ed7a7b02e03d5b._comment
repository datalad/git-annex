Maybe i didn't explain clearly at the beginning:  `/Volumes/subproject` is a remote partition connected via smb://.  It doesn't have a `.git`.  The content I mentioned previously \"copied\" there was copied via `cp -R`.  And my local annex is `~/project/subproject` and it does have `.git` and `.git/annex` in it.
