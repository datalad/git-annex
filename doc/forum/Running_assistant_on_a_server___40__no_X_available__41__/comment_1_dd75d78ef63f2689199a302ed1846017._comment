You don't need the webapp to run the assistant, but if you want, you can forward it to your local system. You will find the URL in .git/annex/url and have to extract the port from it (http://127.0.0.1:<someport>/.../), afterwards forward that port either via ssh port forwarding or via a webserver acting as a reverse proxy.
