If this is a true server, with a static IP (or some dynamic DNS), there is no need to run the assistant on it; clients using the assistant can ssh in and sync data to it directly.

Anyway, you can git config web.browser to run some script with the url it will be passed to the webapp when the webapp is started. I sometimes configure it to just echo the url out; it'd also be possible to automate
setting up a redirection for a remote browser, I suppose.
