It seems that some versions of git-shell will give this unhelpful
error message. Newer versions instead say 
"fatal: Interactive git shell is not enabled."

The initial push of the git-annex branch is not what failed.
It seems that the attempt to run "git-annex-shell gcryptsetup"
was what failed.

My guess is that the remote server has an older version of git-annex
installed in /usr/bin, which doesn't understand the gcryptsetup
command, and that your newer installation of the standalone
version is not getting run when it sshes in. (A common problem; `~/.bashrc`
and `~/.bash_profile` are both ignored.) The old version of
git-annex-shell then passed the "gcryptsetup" command on to git-shell,
which I guess rejected it like that. (Not sure why.)

git-annex seems to have successfully fallen back to using rsync to
configure the ssh://ma/meta/s/spw/local/annex repository's core.gcrypt-id.
(You might want to check that was set correctly.)

Also, since it detected an old/not-working git-annex-shell on the remote,
it will have set git.remote.ma.gcrypt to "true", rather than
"shell", and this will cause git-annex to bypass using git-annex-shell
and instead use direct rsync.
