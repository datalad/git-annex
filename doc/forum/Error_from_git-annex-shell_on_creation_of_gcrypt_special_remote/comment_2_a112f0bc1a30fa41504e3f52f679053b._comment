The `core.gcrypt-id` on the remote and local is correctly set (to the same thing) and `git.remote.ma.annex-gcrypt` (I assume you meant this and not `git.remote.ma.gcrypt`) on my local machine is indeed set to `true`.  And the remote seems to work for all purposes I've tried to use it for.  So I guess I'm okay.

There is an older version in `/usr/bin` as you suggest: 3.20120523.  I don't know why I didn't notice this myself before I installed the standalone build.

Thank you for taking the time to reply.
