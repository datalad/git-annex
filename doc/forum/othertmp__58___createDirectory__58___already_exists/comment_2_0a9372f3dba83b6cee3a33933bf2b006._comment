Seems that your `.git/annex/othertmp` has somehow became a file.
git-annex expects it to be a directory, or to not exist, but when it's
a file, git-annex doesn't understand what is happening and so can fail this
way.

It's probably safe to delete a `.git/annex/othertmp` file,
although since you had disk corruption, 
you might want to take a backup of it first.
