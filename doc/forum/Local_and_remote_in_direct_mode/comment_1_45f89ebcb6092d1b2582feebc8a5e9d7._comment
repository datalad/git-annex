The \"Remote server using ssh\" option in the webapp is intended to set up a bare git repository on a server, not a non-bare git repository on a client.

For what you want, both your computers need to be running the git-annex assistant.

* If the computers are on the same network, pick the \"Local computer\" option on one to start a pairing process with the other.
* If the computers are not on the same network, but can (apparently) access one-another by ssh, then you're a lucky guy. :) But the webapp doesn't cater to this unusual configuration (unless the local pairing option above works). All you need to do though, it manually add a git remote on each that points to the already existing, git-annex assistant managed repository on the other. Eg: `git remote add B ssh://machineB:/~/annex`
* If the computers are not on the same network, and cannot access each other directly using ssh, you will need
to use the XMPP option, and a transfer remote that both can access.
