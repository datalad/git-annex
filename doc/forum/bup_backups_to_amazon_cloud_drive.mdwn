I have the following setup:

1. Removable hard drive (truecrypt)
2. Removable hard drive (truecrypt)
3. Amazon Cloud drive

I usually use bup to make backups to (1) and (2) but now I would like to add (3). I would like to take advantage of git annex to sync/pull my backups easily, however git-annex doesn't like git inside git for some reason. Git annex give me the following features:

1. Encryption using gnupg
2. Pulling a backup is easy from remote then I run bup on the pulled backup.

Any suggestion on how to accomplish this?
