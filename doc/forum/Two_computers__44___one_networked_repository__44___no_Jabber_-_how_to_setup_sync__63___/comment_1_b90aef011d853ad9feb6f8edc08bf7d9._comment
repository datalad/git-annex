Since Alice and Bob are never online at the same time, you need
a central git repository somewhere. 

This could be on a linux server, perhaps even with git-annex installed.
Or, you could just make a repository on github or gitorious. No need
for git-annex.

Wherever it is, add the central repository as a git remote on Alice and
Bob, and they'll each use it to drop off the current state of their
git repo, and sync up with the changes from each other.
