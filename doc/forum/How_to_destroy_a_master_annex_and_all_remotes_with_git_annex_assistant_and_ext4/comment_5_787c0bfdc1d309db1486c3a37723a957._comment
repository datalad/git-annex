Oh i've had that type of crash from ecryptfs many times over many different versions of Ubuntu, also before i even encountered git-annex.

Git-annex might provoke this issue, but it is by no means the only thing that can crash your system when running ecryptfs.

I highly suggest you try LUKS for a stable experience.
