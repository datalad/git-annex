I've figured it out:

In the annex in which the view was made (in my case *sdrive*), the views must be deleted with single-quotes:

    git branch -D 'views/(added=14_09);(tag=Shared)'
    git branch -D 'views/(added=14_09);Images_=_'
    git branch -D 'views/added=_'

In the connected annexes, for which *sdrive* is a remote, this command removes the remote branches:

    git fetch -p sdrive

     x [deleted]         (none)     -> sdrive/views/(added=14_09);(tag=Shared)
     x [deleted]         (none)     -> sdrive/views/(added=14_09);Images_=_
     x [deleted]         (none)     -> sdrive/views/added=_

After these steps *git annex* recognized old files as unused.
