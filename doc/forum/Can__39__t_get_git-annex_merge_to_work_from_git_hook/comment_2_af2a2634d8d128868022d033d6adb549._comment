Having just set up <http://annex.debconf.org> which uses a git hook to run `git annex merge`, I can say that the main problems you are likely to run into are:

1. The hook might be run with the cwd not set to the top of the git repository. cd to the git repository in the hook to fix.
2. The hook might be run with `GIT_DIR` set to a strange value (in my case, it was set to \".\"), which is not the actual .git directory location. Unsetting it fixes that.

I don't know about how to get git hooks to work on FAT filesystems though. Hooks have to be executable, and most systems probably don't mount such filesystems with executability allowed.
