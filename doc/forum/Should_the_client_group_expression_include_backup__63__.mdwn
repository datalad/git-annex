I have some repositories in group backup and some in client. I was surprised that I had to add the backup repositiries to group archive as well for the client groupwanted expression work as intended.

So shouldn't the client expression read

    (include=* and ((exclude=*/archive/* and exclude=archive/*) or (not (copies=archive:1 or copies=smallarchive:1 or copies=backup:1)))) or approxlackingcopies=1

instead of just

    (include=* and ((exclude=*/archive/* and exclude=archive/*) or (not (copies=archive:1 or copies=smallarchive:1)))) or approxlackingcopies=1

?
