I am using the importfeed [1] functionality.

How am I supposed to update the feed/feeds?

I understand that running

    cd annex; git annex importfeed http://url/to/podcast

a second time will 'do the right thing'.  But that is cumbersome as I have to know the url again.  Is there sth like git annex updatefeeds?
