Right, the assistant doesn't have a way to get notified of your manual
commits, so it doesn't promptly push them.

While the assistant could be modified to watch git branch files for changes,
I think that for most people wanting to make manual commits, running `git
annex sync --content` is a better approach. It does all the same syncing
that the assistant would.
