I've committed the queue flush improvements, so it will buffer up to 10240 git actions, and then flush the queue.

There may be other memory leaks at scale (besides the two I mentioned earlier), but this seems promising. I'm well into running `git annex add` on a half million files and it's using 18 mb ram and has flushed the queue several times. This run
will fail due to running out of inodes for the log files, not due to memory. :)
