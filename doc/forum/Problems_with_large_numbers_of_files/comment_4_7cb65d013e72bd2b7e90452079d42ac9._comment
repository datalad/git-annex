OK, I'll try increasing the stack size and see if that helps.

For reference, I was running:

git annex add .

on a directory containing about 100k files spread over many nested subdirectories. I actually have more than a dozen projects like this that I plan to keep in git annex, possibly in separate repositories if necessary. I could probably tar the data and then archive that, but I like the idea of being able to see the structure of my data even though the contents of the files are on a different machine.

After the crash, running:

git annex unannex

does nothing and returns instantly. What exactly is 'git annex add' doing? I know that it's moving files into the key-value store and adding symlinks, but I don't know what else it does.
