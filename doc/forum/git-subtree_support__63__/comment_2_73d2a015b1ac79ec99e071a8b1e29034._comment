The point of git-subtree is that I can import another repository into sub-directory, i.e. I can have a directory called \"work\" that contains all files from the annex I have at work. If I make the other annex a remote and merge its contents, then all contents is going to be merged at the top-level, which is somewhat undesirable in my particular case.
