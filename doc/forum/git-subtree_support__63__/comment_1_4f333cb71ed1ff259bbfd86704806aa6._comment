I have no experience using git-subtree, but as long as the home repository has the work one as a git remote, it will automatically merge work's git-annex branch with its own git-annex branch, and so will know what files are present at work, and will be able to get them.

Probably you won't want to make work have home as a remote, so work's git-annex will not know which files home has, nor will it be able to copy files to home (but home will be able to copy files to work).
