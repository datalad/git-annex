1. This followup question seems to have nothing to do with the original question. (The aswer to the original question was `git annex fsck --fast`.)
2. I find it hard to believe that a crashing terminal emulator will create a lot of folders.
3. You show 36k subdirectories in .git/annex/objects. If I make a *tiny* 100 mb ext2 filesystem, it has 26k inodes. A 200 mb filesystem has 50k. So we're talking about a number of directories that is only large when using hardware from 1996.

I'm not convinced yet that anything is wrong, or that there's anything you can do to improve matters. In any case, see [[todo/wishlist:_pack_metadata_in_direct_mode]].
