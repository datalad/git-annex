Joey,

I have sometimes experienced that there is way too much content in the `.git/annex/objects` folder.  For instance, my terminal emulator recently crashed during a sync which seemed to create a lot of folders.  

In the annex repo where this happened I now got way too many folders (annex sometimes complain about no. of inodes or something like that) and I don't know how to clean it correctly.

Here's a \"screenshot\":

    [doc.annex] $ ls -a
    .  ..  documents  .git  .gitignore
    [doc.annex] $ find . -type d | wc -l
    38568
    [doc.annex] $ git annex fsck  > /dev/null 2>&1
    [doc.annex] $ find . -type d | wc -l
    38568
    [doc.annex] $ git annex repair  > /dev/null 2>&1
    [doc.annex] $ find . -type d | wc -l
    38568
    [doc.annex] $ find documents -type d | wc -l
    1513
    [doc.annex] $ find .git/annex/objects -type d | wc -l
    36712

This is a `direct`-mode repo.  With `.git/objectcts` I can use `git gc`.  How can I tell annex to tidy up?  I have tried `fsck`, `repair` and `forget`.

Any hints on how to deal with this?  Other than manually clean up by deleting `.git/annex/objects` and rerunning `fsck`?
