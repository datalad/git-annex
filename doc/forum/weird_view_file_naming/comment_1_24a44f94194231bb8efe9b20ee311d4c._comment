therefore instead of tagging the files _and_ placing them into subdirectories (which somehow seems confounding views reperesentation), i'll be using sparse checkout for the subdirectories I need.

i'll be looking in sparse checkouts so that i have separate trees checked out from same annex ( see http://git-annex.branchable.com/forum/sparse_git_checkouts_with_annex/ )
