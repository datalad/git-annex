Hello. git-annex has been working fine for me for quite some time. But at this moment it has left me in a pickle.

One of my remotes appears to have decided to move to an unlocked state. It is located on an ext4 filesystem and after I ran `git-annex sync` it started replacing broken symlinks with small text files and non-broken symlinks with a copy of the file it was pointing to. I did create a _different_ repository that, for technical reasons, needed to run entirely in the unlocked mode. It seems this setting has propagated to this repository?

The repository seems to have filled my entire filesystem. I already moved everything else I had (before I noticed this was a serious problem) and git-annex kept expanding.

From `git-annex info`:

```
available local disk space: 8.77 megabytes (+1 megabyte reserved)
local annex size: 1.76 terabytes
size of annexed files in working tree: 5.1 terabytes
```

My hard disk is _not_ 5 TB in size, it is 2 TB and is already full! With git-annex! I really need to scale back the ambitions of this repository.

The contents of `.git/annex/transfer` were removed. All operations I tried ended up with multiple messages like

```
  not enough free space, need 1.03 GB more (use --force to override this check or adjust annex.diskreserve)
[2022-09-18 12:53:58.539936066] (Annex.InodeSentinal) /mnt/hotswap/annex/projects/mujka/export-testrun-004.avi inode cache empty
```

and then hanging. I recall an sqlite error message also complaining about lack of space, but I don't see it now.

I tried to move some files from the `annex/object` store temporarily as to provide some additional breathing room (hoping that git-annex would not notice they were gone, but I had copies in other repositories), and tried to lock files again or move content elsewhere. The newly freed space was gobbled up and my attempted operation was ignored. So those were a few steps taken backwards.

The version information is below, if it helps.

I am now reaching a point where I don't know what to do. I think I ran out of good ideas on how to keep this repository under control. Nuking it _is_ a possibility, but if this happens to another repository, I'm in trouble. So I'm reaching out to more knowledgeable people to help me figure out what is going on and how to address it nicely. Please help me. Thank you.
