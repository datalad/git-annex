Yes, you are right. ``git-annex add`` got through almost all of the files in the first run, which I did a week ago, I am not sure how long it took, several days I think (which is fine, time isn't that important here).

I re-ran ``git-annex add .`` yesterday after having trouble with ``git commit``, which is when I uncovered these problems. I think you are right that the problem appears when git-annex is staging files into the index. No problems occurred during checksumming or moving files.

Also, the repo isn't as large as I thought, it if 4.1TB, so it makes sense that the issue is number of files, not files size.

``git add`` and ``git commit`` are now working fine, all git operations (e.g. ``git status``) are now taking around 30s to 1 min, which is acceptable. 

I am going to try and move the data to the remotes now. Is there anything special I need to do since the remotes are smaller than the current repo? The remotes are just single drives with ext4 filesystems and an empty repo on them. I ideally want to fill each drive as much as possible, and have the current repo contain no files, how do I do that? Can I just run ``git-annex move --to mito_backup1`` and then when it is full run a second command of ``git-annex move --to mito_backup2``.  Is it better to use ``git-annex copy`` instead of ``move`` and then use ``drop`` after?

Thanks!
