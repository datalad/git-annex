It will be faster to use `git annex move`, assuming you want to only have 1 copy of each file, and not more. git-annex will stop storing files on a drive once it gets close to full (annex.diskreserve), and you can safely interrupt it and switch to the next drive.

Do you have any special git configuration? In particular I'm curious about any annex.queuesize setting, which if set to something really high would make `git annex add` buffer a lot of filenames and stage them all at once. (However, I just noticed that annex.queuesize didn't cause as large a queue to be used as intended, so it would need to have been set to some really enormous value to run it out of stack space.)

Also, see [[scalability]].
