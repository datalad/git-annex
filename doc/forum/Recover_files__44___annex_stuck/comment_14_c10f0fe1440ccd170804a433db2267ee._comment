As far as I know I am using the defaults, I didn't customize anything. I am thinking of switching to the WORM backend though as I think it will make things a little faster, but I haven't done that yet.

Also, I actually compiled cabal-install with the ghc flag ``-rtsopts`` and git-annex with flags ``-rtsopts -with-rtsopts=-K1000m``. Due to the amount of memory available, I am not worried if git-annex leaks memory and uses 1GB of memory during operations, but I have been watching it with htop, and its memory usage is usually very small.
