git-annex could be made to always use cp for local transfers, see Remote/Git.hs rsyncOrCopyFile and change `ifM (sameDeviceIds src dest) (docopy, dorsync)` to just `docopy`

However, I doubt that will be a significant speedup. It's more likely that the overhead around copying a file and updating the location tracking etc adds up with millions of small files.
