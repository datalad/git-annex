Both of those du's look extremely large. How many files are listed by `git ls-files --cached | wc -l` ?

I don't think that there's any point in running `git annex add` while you're still having some problem. I am curious though how much memory the git-annex add you have running has used.

If I were you, I'd look in .git/objects for large files (> 100kb, say).
