Not sure, what you mean.

Disabling sync?
But that also disables sync, right?  ;-)  So, if I add a file manually (via command line) that file is not synced automatically, correct?

I do not see any other 'pause' button next to the repository.

I am fine with git-annex doing the syncing automatically for me, but I want to be in control over the files git annex actually uses.

If I just downloaded a big file, I might want to check it first before having git-annex move it to other repositories.
