This is perfectly normal. The next time that file in the git-annex branch is updated for any reason, git-annex will automatically compress the two entries down to a single one. In the meantime, it has no difficulty working out which entry is more recent. This is basically why it's called a log file. ;)

It would be possible to make the union merge code compress as it merges, but this would slow down union merging some, and make it a more conceptually complicated operation. Also, whether the old entry is present in the file or not, git will be storing a copy of that old entry, so it doesn't actually tend to make the git repository any larger.
