Remotes have configurable costs, see `remote.<name>.annex-cost`
documentation in [[git-annex]].

`git annex get` and some other commands can be used with `-J3` to
download multiple files at once. However, it only downloads
each file from the cheapest remote that has a copy.

It would perhaps be an interesting improvement to make it round-robin
amoung remotes if there are multiple ones that have the same cost.
