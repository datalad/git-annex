However, I have just noticed that my user authentication gets stored in git annex (which I would like to avoid). I came across this comment in a tip from quite a number of years ago (https://git-annex.branchable.com/tips/using_the_web_as_a_special_remote/) which stated that \"If you want to protect the password from being exposed to anyone who gets a clone of the repository, just download manually, and then git annex add the file.\" Is this still the case?
