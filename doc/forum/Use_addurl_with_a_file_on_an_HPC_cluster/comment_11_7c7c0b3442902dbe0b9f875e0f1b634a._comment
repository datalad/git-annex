git-annex doesn't prompt for passwords for files downloaded from the web,
and it only stores the password if it's included in the url given to it. 

So if you don't want to store the password in the git repository, storing
it in an outside file like the netrc file seems like the only way.

I wonder if the web special remote is a good fit for what you're doing at
all. It's not intended for authenticated access, but for access to files on
the public web. It may be that you would be better off using a
special-purpose remote that handles the downloads and passwords in whatever
way makes sense for the HPC cluster. See [[special_remotes/external]].
