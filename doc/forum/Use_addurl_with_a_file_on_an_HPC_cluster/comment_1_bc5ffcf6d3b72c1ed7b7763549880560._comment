git-annex can be used with any url scheme that curl supports, but you have to
configure it to allow using it. See the documentation 
of annex.security.allowed-url-schemes in the git-annex man page.

You will also have to set annex.security.allowed-ip-addresses
to "all".

It seems that even with both settings, git-annex still avoids using curl
for unsupported url schemes, unless you also set annex.web-options
to some option used by curl. That forces it to use curl. I set it to
"--netrc". You will probably need to use that option anyway since I think
curl needs configuration in a netrc file to authenticate for sftp.

(I feel that it's a bug that annex.web-options needs to be set to make it
use curl, and I've fixed that in master.)
