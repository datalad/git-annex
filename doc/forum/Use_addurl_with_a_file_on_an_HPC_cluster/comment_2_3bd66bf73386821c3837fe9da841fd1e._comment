I am really quite new to git annex (but am excited to familiarize myself with it!), so I don't know how to modify settings. I've tried this:
$ git annex config --set annex.security.allowed-ip-addresses \"all\"
git-annex: annex.security.allowed-ip-addresses is not a configuration setting that can be stored in the git-annex branch

I am also having a difficult time parsing through the webpage to find the documentation on the allowed-url-schemes setting.
