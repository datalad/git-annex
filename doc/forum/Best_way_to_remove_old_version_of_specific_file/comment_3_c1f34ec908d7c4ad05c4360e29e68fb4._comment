I mean, as I understand it I unlock the file, modify it, re-add it, commit, go to the previous revision and drop the annexed old version there. I see this as an instance of the remove-old-annexed-version general case, which AFAIK is valid. What am I missing here? Should I lock instead of adding the new file?
