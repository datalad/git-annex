Is there also a straight forward way to drop all versions of a specific file?

In option 1, I always have to drop the file right away. In my use case it makes more sense to drop (all) older versions of a specific file from time to time.

Typically I want to keep old versions (of other files), therefore I can't use drop unused. But for some specific files, I want to get rid of the history at some point in time (e.g., after the project they belong to is finished).

Alternatively, is there a way to get all prior keys a specific file once pointed to? Then I could drop all these keys.
