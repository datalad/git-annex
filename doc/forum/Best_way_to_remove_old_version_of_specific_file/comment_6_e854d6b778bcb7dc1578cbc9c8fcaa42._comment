@mario interesting question..

You could use `git log --raw` to list old versions of the file, and
then use `git show` to find the git-annex key.

Doable, but would take quite a lot of bother to script.
I think it would be a good enhancement to git-annex to
add a [[todo/command_to_list_keys_for_old_versions_of_files]].
