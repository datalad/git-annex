Your alternative B does not actually remove the old version of the file,
because git-annex unlock keeps a copy in .git/annex/objects
(except when using v6 mode with annex.thin).

Alternative A is fine, if you just want to remove the old version
of the file from the local repository. Other clones of the repository
may still have the content of that file though.

I use alternative A fairly frequently in my own repositories, and then
sometimes followup with `git annex unused` in clones and dropping all
unused files.
