Described behavior sounds right to me. If you've clicked on "syncing
enabled" in the webapp for the local repository, so it's changed to
"syncing disabled" then the webapp won't automatically commit file
deletions/adds. Click on it again and it'll catch up with any changes you
made while it was disabled.
