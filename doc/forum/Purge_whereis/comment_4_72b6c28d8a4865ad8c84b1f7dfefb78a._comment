I did some digging. When creating a repo from the webapp, it is per default in direct mode. In direct mode, I am not able to run any git commands such as git commit. Subsequently, when running git annex sync. Files added when sync is disabled from the webapp are not committed.

Is git-annex behaving as expected here?
