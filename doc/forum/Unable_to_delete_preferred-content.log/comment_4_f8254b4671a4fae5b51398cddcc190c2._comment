Thanks, Joey. That seems to work based on my testing. Appreciate the quick and precise response!

Fixing my actual repo will have to wait since one of my nodes is now offline, but hopefully that goes off without a glitch.

Also just want to say how awesome git annex is. I've been using it for nearly 10 years now and don't see myself ever wanting to stop.
