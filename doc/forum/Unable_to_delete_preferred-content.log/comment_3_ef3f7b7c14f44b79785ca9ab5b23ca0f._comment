Ah, you're right that this future change in `git-annex sync` behavior is
one way that "anything" is different from not configured.

It turns out that you can just use `git-annex wanted here ""` to get back
the same behavior as the preferred content being unset. I had forgotten
about that, and it was not really documented anywhere, which I've
corrected.

Running `git-annex sync` without --content with preferred content set to ""
currently warns about the transition, but that warning is false. I'm fixing
it to not warn in this case.

As to the heroic measures, .git/annex/index gets merged into whatever is in
the git-annex branch, so you need to delete that file as well as rewriting
the branch. And you need to do this in every single repository that has
received the unwanted change. And since it also auto-merges git-annex
branches from remotes, you probably will want to temporarily remove the
remote tracking branches from git's ref list.
