I'd guess that however you have installed git-annex does not result in
git-annex-shell being in PATH until .bashrc or similar is loaded. 

Since bash refuses to load any such files when a command like "ssh thehost
git-annex-shell" is run, you can't install git-annex-shell that way. You
have to install it somewhere in the default PATH.
