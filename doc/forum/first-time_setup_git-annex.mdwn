I have a git installation on my web server (web faction hosting). It allows me to run repositories from my hosting account. 

What I want is to use git-annex as a dropbox replacement. Specifically, the central repository being my web server and then using local installations on my 2 mac laptops (primarily), access through browser on windows, and access on android as well (browser or some other method). 

I'm looking at the install instructions, walkthrough, etc. What I'm initially not clear on is whether I need to install git-annex on my (linux centOS) webserver and any machine through which I'm accessing the repo? Seems like that would be the case of course, but I wanted to validate. 

Am I going to run into issues that folks might already be able to warn me about? Anything I need to know?
