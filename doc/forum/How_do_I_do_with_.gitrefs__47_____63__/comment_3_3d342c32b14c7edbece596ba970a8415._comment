A bug in the git repository repair code caused packed-refs files to be exploded to .gitrefs instead of .git/refs. I have fixed that bug.

To fix up a repository that this happened to, I'd recommend checking if there are any tags and branches in the .gitrefs directory that have gone missing from .git/refs.. If so, you could move the files back into place (unannexing them first if necessary). Otherwise, deleting .gitrefs would seem to be the thing to do.
