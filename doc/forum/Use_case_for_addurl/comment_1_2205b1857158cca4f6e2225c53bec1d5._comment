The use case is to be able to `git annex addurl` in one repository
and `git annex get` in another checkout, without needing to remember 
the url yourself. Or to use `git annex whereis` to look up the url
associated with a file.

When --relaxed is used, you're telling git-annex you want to treat
the current and future content of the url as close enough to the same
as to not matter. I wouldn't use it if I expected the content of an url to 
change significantly, and git-annex is not able to help with manageing such
differences.
