Seems we can rule out user/hostname/directory, which probably leaves
the ssh public key as the culprit, but I'm not sure.

So, I changed the error message to display the problem data,
in [[!commit 5fd15677042b66be81936f081fe0a17f5960096f]]. Once you have a
git-annex version with that commit, if you see the problem, paste in the
error message and I should be able to get to the bottom of this.
