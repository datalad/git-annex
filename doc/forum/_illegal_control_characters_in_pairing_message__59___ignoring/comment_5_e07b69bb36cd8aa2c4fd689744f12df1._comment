Is "username@iMac.home" data that you obscured, or are you actually using
an account called "username" with a hostname of "iMac.home"?

As I said before, this is likely caused by some character that git-annex
dooes not like in username or hostname of the other host than the one that
displays the error.

Hopefully one of you guys who can reproduce the problem can get this basic
information to me, so I can try to get to the bottom of the problem.
