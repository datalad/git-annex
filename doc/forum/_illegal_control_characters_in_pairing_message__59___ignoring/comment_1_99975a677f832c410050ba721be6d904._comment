This probably has something to do with the hostname of the other host than
the one that displays the error. Or possibly with the name of the user on
that host, or the directory on that host where the git-annex repository is.

Can you share that information, or at least the parts of it that are not
regular alphabet characters?

(There's also an outside possibility it could have found a control
character in the ssh public key, but I don't see how.)
