These messages are normal in direct mode. 

They happen because git status does not know about git-annex's direct mode. So it sees a file that has a symlink checked into git, but a normal file in place in the working tree. Thus, its type has changed. Short of hacking or wrapping git, or switching to indirect mode ;), there's not much that can be done about this.

You might want to read [[direct_mode]] for more about this, and some of the problems it can cause when running certian git commands.
