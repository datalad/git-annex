I've added an arm build to the autobuilds in [[install/Linux_standalone]].

I'm curious to see how this works out. I tried to make it as self-contained
as possible. It should work even on systems that do not use glibc, as long
as the kernel is new enough for the glibc included in it, and supports the
arm EABI.

If it seems sufficiently useful, I might try to add the webapp to the
build, which would be somewhat complicated, but doable (since I'm building
using qemu, it can run a build on amd64 first to get the TH splices).
