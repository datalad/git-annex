Hey, I hope somebody can help me:

I recently moved a bunch of files to another location shortly after I renamed them. The assistant was running (repo: indirect mode) and I guess the assistant was confused about whether to commit the rename changes or to fix the symlinks because of the location move (and to commit these changes). I don't know much about the internal design, but after that my repository was kinda broken. Every git command failed and also "git fsck" gave me some error messages. However, I mounted my external drive (backup repo) and tried a "git annex repair". It took quite a while, but it could fix the repo....somehow. This is the current status:

    ~/private [master●] » git annex info
    repository mode: indirect

    [... some more dangling objects ...]

However, git annex repair does not want to repair my repo a second time:

    ~/private [master●] » git annex repair
    Running git fsck ...
    No problems found.
    ok
My directory seems to be fine, also the data (symlinks) I renamed & moved are also fine. Just the "git-annex" branch seems to be broken now and I don't know how to fix that.

Cheers,
Stephan
