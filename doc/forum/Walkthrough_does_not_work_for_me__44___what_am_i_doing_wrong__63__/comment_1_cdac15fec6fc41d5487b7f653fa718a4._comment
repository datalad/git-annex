Hi,

Sounds to me you are expecting the files to be readable by a filemanager? By default a removable drive repo is only readable by git-annex.

The standard use case is to move files between computers with git-annex installed. I agree this is not what youÂ´d expect.

Read <http://git-annex.branchable.com/forum/USB_backup_with_files_visible/> and the last post of <http://git-annex.branchable.com/forum/Can__39__t_get_git-annex_merge_to_work_from_git_hook/> for more info.
