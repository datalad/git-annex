If I have three repositories setup in the git annex webui as:

full backup,

and every file put into one of the repos seems to be propagated to the other two,

what is the usage of the setting "number of copies" which is default to 1 but can be increased to 2 or 3? Does this setting matter in this context?

I'm using assistant version 5.20140517.4
