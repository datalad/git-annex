The walkthrough assumes a system that uses indirect mode by default, so it won't work quite right on Windows, which is forced to use direct mode.

Running `git annex fsck` in the server repository will fix up this situation, but the right thing on Windows is to use `git annex sync` rather than the manual `git fetch + git merge` the walkthrough shows.

Guess I'll make the walkthrough use sync, although it may make it harder for people to understand what's going on internally.
