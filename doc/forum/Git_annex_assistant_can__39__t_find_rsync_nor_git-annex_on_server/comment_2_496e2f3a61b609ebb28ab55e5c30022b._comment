You need to be able to `ssh yourserver which rsync` and have it succeed. That's what git-annex uses to probe if rsync etc is present.

Note that, since that does not start a login shell, bash doesn't source ~/.bash* at all, or even /etc/profile. So none of the ways people add nonstandard directories to PATH will work.

So, use this to check the PATH that is available on the system: `ssh yourserver 'echo $PATH'`
