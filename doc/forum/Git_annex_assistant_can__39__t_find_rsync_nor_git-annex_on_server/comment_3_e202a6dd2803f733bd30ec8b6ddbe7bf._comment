It needed some plumbing, this is what I did:

_~/.ssh/rc_:

    PATH=$HOME/bin:$HOME/.nix-profile/bin:/run/current-system/sw/bin

Since _which_ is an alias (and hence still doesn't work for 'ssh foo which rsync'), I added a shell script _$HOME/bin/which_:

    #!/run/current-system/sw/bin/bash
    type -P $@

Verified to work (syncs both ways) with a cloned repository on arch linux.
