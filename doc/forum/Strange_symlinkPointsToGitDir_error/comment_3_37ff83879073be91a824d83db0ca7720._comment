I don't think this is git's fault, but my gitlab's. The commit says that setting
`fsck.symlinkPointsToGitDir` to `warn` should avoid the problem. It seems,
however, that gitlab has it set to `error` -- your forge probably has the same
setting as well. I can think of only two solutions: 
 
1. Ask gitlab for recourse: maybe they can respect the setting in your local repository 
2. Change to a forge that has it set to `warn`
