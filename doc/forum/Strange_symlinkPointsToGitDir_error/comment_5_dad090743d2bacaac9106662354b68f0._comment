You will need to reach out to gitlab if you want to continue using it. They
need to set `git config receive.fsck.symlinkPointsToGitDir ignore`.

FWIW, github does not (currently) have this behavior.

This change does have some other knock-on effects that git-annex can deal
with, see [[todo/deal_with_git_fsck_symlinkPointsToGitDir]].

I suppose that it would also work to unlock any annexed files that you want
to push to gitlab. It shouldn't matter that there are locked annexed files
in the history you've already pushed, only new commits in the push get
checked.

Using git-remote-gcrypt will also avoid the problem, since gitlab can't
tell that you're a scary symlink user if you encrypt everything. ;-)
