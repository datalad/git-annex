I have brought this reversion to the attention of the git developers

They were already working on reverting a surprisingly large amount of the recent related patches, but not the one that affects git-annex, so I hope they'll include it. 

Seems to have been a case of security fixes under embargo leading to going much too far on trying to harden against future related security problems, with the embargo preventing sufficient review.

Fingers crossed.
