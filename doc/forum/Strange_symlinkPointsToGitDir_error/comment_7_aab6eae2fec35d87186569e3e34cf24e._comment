Is it possible to get my edited file back? 

I know that the file I edited, with it's changes, should be *somewhere* in my .git directory, but I have no idea where (I already undid all commits that contained it's path in my haste to just make it work again), and -- like an idiot -- did not copy it anywhere before doing so.
