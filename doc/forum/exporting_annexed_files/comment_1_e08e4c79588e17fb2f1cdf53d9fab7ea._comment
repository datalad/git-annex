Sure, you can simply:

    cp annexedfile ~

Or just attach the file right from the git repository to an email, like any other file. Should work fine.

If you wanted to copy a whole directory to export, you'd need to use the -L flag to make cp follow the symlinks and copy the real contents:

    cp -r -L annexeddirectory /media/usbdrive/
