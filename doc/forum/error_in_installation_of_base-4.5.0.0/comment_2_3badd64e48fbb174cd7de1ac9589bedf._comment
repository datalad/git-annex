Thanks for the fast response!

Unfortunately, I had another problem:

==================================
Building git-annex-3.20120419...
Utility/libdiskfree.c: In function ‘diskfree’:

Utility/libdiskfree.c:61:0:
     warning: ‘statfs64’ is deprecated (declared at /usr/include/sys/mount.h:379)

[ 15 of 157] Compiling Utility.Touch    ( dist/build/git-annex/git-annex-tmp/Utility/Touch.hs, dist/build/git-annex/git-annex-tmp/Utility/Touch.o )

Utility/Touch.hsc:118:21: Not in scope: `noop'
cabal: Error: some packages failed to install:
git-annex-3.20120419 failed during the building phase. The exception was:
ExitFailure 1
==================================

I also tried to look for information on the internet, and I did not find anything useful.
Any idea of what happened?

Thanks again!
