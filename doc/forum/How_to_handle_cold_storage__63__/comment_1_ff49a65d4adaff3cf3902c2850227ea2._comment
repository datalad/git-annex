This is what [[todo/do_not_count_trusted_repos_toward_mincopies]] is kind
of about; setting a repo to trusted right now is a promise that you won't
delete data from it, or will be careful when you do to sync that fact to
everywhere. If that todo got implemented, you could set all the offline
drives to trusted and git-annex drop would only need to verify 1 copy is
present on an online drive.

What I do right now is use trusted for cold storage and never drop
anything from it except in cases where I want to get rid of all copies of
some file.
