The assistant will push, pull, and merge the master and git-annex branches (which is exactly what git annex sync does). 

Additionally, the assistant will transfer file contents to the bare repository, either to make it have a copy of everything, or as needed to transfer to other repositories that also use that bare repository. This behavior is configurable using the webapp.
