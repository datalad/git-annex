When I make a change in the repository and run a plain old `git annex sync`, it pushes out to any other available annex, but not to my bare hub. If I run `git annex sync` a second time it tells me that I'm ahead of the hub:

    commit
    # On branch master
    # Your branch is ahead of 'hub/master' by 1 commit.
    #
    nothing to commit, working directory clean
    ok

In order to push the changes out to the hub I have to do `git push --all`.

The same thing with pulling. If I make a change on the annex, push it to the hub, and then go to a second annex that knows about the hub but not the first annex, a `git annex sync` does not pull the changes in from the hub. I have to do `git pull` to get them.

Do I have something setup incorrectly?
