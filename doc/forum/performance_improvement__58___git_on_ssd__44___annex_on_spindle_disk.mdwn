This works with bind-mount, I might try with softlinks as well.

Going through git's data on push/pull can take ages on a spindle disk even
if the repo is rather small in size. This is especially true if you are
used to ssd speeds, but ssd storage is expensive. Storing the annex objects
on a cheap spindle disk and everything else on a ssd makes things a _lot_
faster.
