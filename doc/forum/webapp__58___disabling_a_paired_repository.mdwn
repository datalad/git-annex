I had two repositories, on different machines, created with the assistant, so they were both direct mode.

After pairing each with the other, so that files were merrily flowing back and forth, I happened to do the following:
 * on machine A, in the dashboard
 * click on the 'actions' emnu for the repository on machine B
 * select 'disable'

Result: all references to the repo on machine B have disappeared from the assistant in machine A.

On machine B, I still have the pairing with machine A, and selecting the 'sync now' action seems to be working.

The thing I am curious about is the behaviour on machine A - why is it that I cannot find any reference to it any more in the assistant, so that I can re-enable it?
