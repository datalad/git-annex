@Lukey is probably right. The one exception would be if the
S3 remote was set up with encryption=pubkey. Then the files
stored in the bucket would be simply encrypted to your gpg public key, and
could be decrypted without needing any other information that you've lost.

(The filenames would still not be able to be recovered.)
