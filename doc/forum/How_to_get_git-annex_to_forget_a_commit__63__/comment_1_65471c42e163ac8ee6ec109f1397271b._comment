Joey has pointed me to the solution.

git-annex was remembering these files due to them being present in *.git/annex/index*.

A simple `rm .git/annex/index` after moving the git-annex branch to the earlier commit prevents the \"ghost\" log files from being recreated and Joey confirmed this is safe to do (git-annex automatically recreates it).
