Ah, gotcha.

When adding an url to an annexed file, git-annex doesn't download the
content again, because that could be a lot of work, instead it checks
if the size is the same, which is the same check that git-annex always uses
to see if the web still seems to have the content of a file.

It doesn't feel safe to relax the size check when the web server doesn't
send a Content-Length, because then there's no indication at all 
that this url really has the same content as the file. It *might* make
sense for git-annex to download all the content again in that case, and
check if it's the expected content and only then add it. However, that
could be a whole lot of unwanted work to do.

If the user is sure that the url has the same content, it does make sense
for them to add --relaxed. So, perhaps what's needed is a --strict
for the users who are not sure and want to force a full download to check.

Here's how to check it yourself, without any changes to git-annex.

	wget -O tmp.git-annex_views_demo.ogg http://web.archive.org/web/20171117120847/https://downloads.kitenet.net/videos/git-annex/git-annex_views_demo.ogg
	if [ "$(git annex calckey tmp.git-annex_views_demo.ogg)" == "$(git annex find --format '${key}' git-annex_views_demo.ogg)" ]; then
		git annex addurl \"http://web.archive.org/web/20171117120847/https://downloads.kitenet.net/videos/git-annex/git-annex_views_demo.ogg\" --file git-annex_views_demo.ogg --relaxed
	fi
	rm tmp.git-annex_views_demo.ogg
