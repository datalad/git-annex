Is it possible to convert a regular git annex repo (git clone then git annex init in the folder), to an rsync remote. I have an annex with alot of remotes which makes the sync operation take a really long time. I would like to convert some of those remotes to rsync. This particular repo has a TB of data so I would like to avoid dropping content from the remote than re download everything.
