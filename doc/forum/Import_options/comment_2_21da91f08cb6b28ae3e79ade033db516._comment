Imported several thousand files to annex and would like to add the following comments:

- it would be great to have an option to exclude hidden dot files from import,

- empty directories should be deleted when files located in the directories are deleted,

- \"git annex add\" seems to process directories and files alphabetically, unfortunately import processes files in a different order, which makes it hard to predict which files are deleted when deduplicating,

Cheers,
