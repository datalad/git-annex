Posted the above yesterday before realizing that it should probably go to wishlist requests. I am sorry about that.

Basically it is a request to extend import options and perhaps make the options easier to use/understand.

Suggested Import Options:

- source directory,
- destination directory,
- deduplicate in annex ( yes, no )
- delete source files ( yes, no )
- trial run ( screen output only )

Many thanks for a great product!
