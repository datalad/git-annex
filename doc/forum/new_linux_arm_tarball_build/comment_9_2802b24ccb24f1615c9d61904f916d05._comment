This seems to work great for me on Raspbian, except I get many errors of the form

    ERROR: ld.so: object '/usr/lib/arm-linux-gnueabihf/libcofi_rpi.so' from /etc/ld.so.preload cannot be preloaded: ignored.

I've tried, but I haven't been able to figure out why ld doesn't like this particular lib.  I can keep ignoring the error, but help would certainly be appreciated!
