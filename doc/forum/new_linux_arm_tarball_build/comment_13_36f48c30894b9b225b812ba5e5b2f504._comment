Unfortunately, it isn't working for me on DS214 (MARVELL Armada XP MV78230) and DSM 5.1-5004 Update 2.
git is installed, git-annex tar extracted and runshell worked. Within this shell git-annex seems to work (e.g. git-annex init works)

However, git-annex is complaining that git-annex is not installed on remote when I try to add the NAS as a remote.

I guess it is related to the fact that git-annex-shell is not working on the NAS. When I execute git-annex-shell it gives:
/volume1/homes/julian/bin/git-annex.linux/shimmed/git-annex-shell/git-annex-shell: error while loading shared libraries: /volume1/homes/julian/bin/git-annex.linux/shimmed/git-annex-shell/git-annex-shell: file too short
Actually /volume1/homes/julian/bin/git-annex.linux/shimmed/git-annex-shell/git-annex-shell has 0 Bytes.

I can't execute git-annex-shell inside the bin folder due to permission issues. I tried to change the file permissions but it didn't help.
