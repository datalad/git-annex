This works fairly well for me on Raspian. However I am getting the same error as Justin. 

    ERROR: ld.so: object '/usr/lib/arm-linux-gnueabihf/libcofi_rpi.so' from /etc/ld.so.preload cannot be preloaded: ignored.

I'm ignoring the errors for now, but it's a lot of noise that actually makes it slightly difficult to see the important output.
