This happens when I launch git-annex-webapp

	[\u@\h \W]$ ./git-annex-webapp
	Launching web browser on file:///tmp/webapp1804289383846930886.html
	git-annex: xdg-open: createProcess: runInteractiveProcess: exec: does not exist (No such file or directory)


And the webapp1804289383846930886.html file seem to be deleted immediately.

This is on a headless NAS and obviously I don't have a browser or anything on it. I just want to run Annex as a server/service and admin it from a browser on another machine on my LAN.
