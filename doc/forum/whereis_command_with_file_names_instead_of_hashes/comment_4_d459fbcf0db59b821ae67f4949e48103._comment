git-annex whereis --not --in here

Does not display anything.

git-annex whereis --not --in here -A

Displays files on remote only. Every file has an additional message (0 copies) failed. This displays hash names. How to display file names ? I am 100% sure that my remote repo has some files that are not present on laptop or PC.
