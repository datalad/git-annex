What will happen with too small a bloom filter is `git-annex unused` may
think that some keys are used which are really not. And 
`git-annex sync --content` may operate on some keys that are not in the
work tree.

The `git-annex info` command displays how much memory the configured bloom
filters use, which is why it's reporting 32 membibytes. But the
annex.bloomcapacity setting is the number of expected files in the work
tree, by default 500000.

It would probably make sense for you to set it to 2000000 or so unless
your system has an unusually small amount of RAM.
