Very cool!

So not only is archive/ a magic subdirectory due to the \"preferred content settings\" for \"client,\" but *every* subdirectory named \"archive\" similarly drops content when possible.  That's awesome to know.

Also if I really wanted to manually manage all my content and still have git-annex assistant running, I could simply use \"present\" for my preferred content settings on my laptop, and it would respect my manual gets and drops.

Thank you!
