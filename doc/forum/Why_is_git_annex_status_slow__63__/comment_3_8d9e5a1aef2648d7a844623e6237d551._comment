The sizes of the files should not affect how fast git-annex status runs. 

But, direct mode certianly does. git-annex has to do significantly more
work in direct mode to figure out the status of a file. Including querying
git. In indirect mode, it can just stat the symlink and see if its content
is present, which is much faster.

(There's probably also some other inneficiencies in Windows.)
