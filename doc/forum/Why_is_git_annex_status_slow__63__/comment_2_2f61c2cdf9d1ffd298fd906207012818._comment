If this is by design and `git annex status` should take more time in direct mode then what I'm experiencing is strange. On windows every 100M file adds approximately 1 second to `status` duration (on my laptop), but on linux it does not. On linux `git annex status` even in direct mode takes milliseconds. What is wrong with my setup?
