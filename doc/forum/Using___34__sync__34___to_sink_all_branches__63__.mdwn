Is there a way to sync all (or a subset of) local branches, not just the currently checked out branch?

Does this make sense at all, or does this show I am missing some important point in git-annex?

I am asking because I would like to use git-annex to keep git repositories with normal git files (with versioned and branched content) in sync.

If it's not currently possible, could you provide some pointers on where to start, if I wanted to change to Haskell source?

Thnx
