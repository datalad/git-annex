Whelp, didn't realise it had been over two weeks! Got caught up in other stuff (VR).

[Here's the bitbucket repository!](https://bitbucket.org/CandyAngel/ga-ncdu)

I've coded my own JSON output so it doesn't depend on any non-core Perl modules.

Please let me know of any bugs, feature requests etc. Feedback would be appreciated, even just letting me know you are using it would be great!
