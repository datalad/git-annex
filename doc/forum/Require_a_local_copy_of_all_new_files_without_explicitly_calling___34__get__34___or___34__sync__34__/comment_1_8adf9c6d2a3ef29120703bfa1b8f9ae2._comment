This is generally handled by using either `git annex sync --content`, which will make the laptops upload new files to the server before they push the git repository to it, or by using the git-annex assistant (on the laptops or perhaps on the server) to automatically copy files. Either way, you configure [[preferred_content]] settings to control which repositories want which  files.
