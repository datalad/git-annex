The local keys are files whose content is locally present.  
The known keys are annexed files in the current branch, whose content may or may not be present. 

Justin is correct -- if you have the same file in the tree twice, it will be counted twice as known keys. Since git-annex deuplicates, only one local key is needed to store it.

The bloom filter is a technical implementation detail that allows the potentially expensive status scan to run in constant space. You can read about it on Wikipedia if interested. :)
