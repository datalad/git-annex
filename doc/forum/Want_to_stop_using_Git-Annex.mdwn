Hi

I created a git annex repo in one of my drives. But now all my files have turned into symbolic links.
I need to remove the git repo and get my files back. How can I do that.

Some of the softwares am using will not follow symbolic links, so need put the files back properly as soon as  possible.

Please help.
Thank you in advance :)
