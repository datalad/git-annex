The custom settings I had made before (the rest are still commented out):
trust a8372263-6eba-47e2-9604-3e2c9bbb6d42 = trusted
wanted 3e2bcb1e-39ad-4863-a9ce-a18a262644c1 = present or (not include=/Books/*)
wanted a8372263-6eba-47e2-9604-3e2c9bbb6d42 = present or include=/Books/*

I am trying to comment them out again.

Based on your answer, I guessed that these settings don't just reset to default when they are commented out, so I tried changing the above trusted setting to semitrusted, and sure enough it worked.

So it seems once these settings are made they can't be commented out again, and any invalid settings are ignored?
