OK. I ended up having to delete all the files from git, then re-add them zipped up.

I re-read the post you mentioned, this helped me resolve my issue:
[assistant crashes in TransferScanner](http://git-annex.branchable.com/bugs/assistant_crashes_in_TransferScanner/) (from johannes)

Johannes dropped the file, then re-added, that fixed his issue. So I tried that first.

I did the following:

 * git-annex dropped all problem files. this didn't fix issue
 * deleted all problem files (using OS-X Finder), committed the deletion with git (git add -A), issue then fixed
    * re-added deleted files, issue came back
    * re-added deleted files in different folder, issue came back
    * re-added deleted files all with different filenames in different path, issue came back
    * zipped up folder of problem files, then added to git-annex, no issues
