Joey,

the file names seem quite ordinary:

Possibly this is related to an issue I had with v6 and `annex.largefiles` about 12-months ago. I had done `git config annex.largefiles 'largerthan=100kb and not (include=*.c or include=*.h)'`. But I believe this resulted in git-annex thinking locked files with no content present should be added to git instead of annex? After doing a `git-annex add .` I now had a bunch of files whose content was lost. Or perhaps I did a sync with a v5 repo, or perhaps I did a sync with a repo with a different large files settings, I can't remember. Anyhow, I managed to lose links to the file content and `git-annex get` or fsck couldn't retrieve them. I never filed a bug report because I was never able to reproduce the issue on a clean repo. 

Anyhow, perhaps spelunking into the git log would give some answers?
