It would be helpful if you said what version of git-annex you are using.

And, is your git-annex repository using the new experimental v6 format? One
user reported a similar error message with a v6 git-annex repository. See
[[bugs/assistant_crashes_in_TransferScanner]]

Or might your repository be using direct mode?

So, please paste in `git annex version` and `git annex info` output.

It kind of looks like it's having difficulty determining where the top of
the git repository is, or constructing a relative path to the git
repository.

Are there any symlinks in the path to /Users/andrew/notes ? Eg, is /Users
a symlink, or /Users/andrew a symlink, or //Users/andrew/notes itself
symlinked to elsewhere?

Does only `git annex sync --content` fail? What if you run, eg
`git annex copy --auto --to cloud` and `git annex get --auto --from cloud`,
does that fail similarly, or does it succeed?

You say it's only failing for some files. Do the filenames that it's
failing on contain any non-ascii characters?
