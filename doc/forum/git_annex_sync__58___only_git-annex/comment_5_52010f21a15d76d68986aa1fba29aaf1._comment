Hi,

thank you for your response. I just want to control my branches (master, dev and so on ...) by myself, without sync/master or sync/dev and without merging it automatically. But the git-annex branch should be populated between the repositories \"magically\" (some kind of \"git annex syncannex\"). As annex can't deliver such a basic functionality i assumed, that it was not designed to work with existing \"real\" git repositories.
