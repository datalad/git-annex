Sounds like you should just use normal `git push`/`git pull` commands.
Works fine with git-annex. 

Just be sure to include the `git-annex` branch in your pushes.
Eg, `git push origin master git-annex`

You'll probably want to run `git annex merge` after pulling, to merge the
local and remote git-annex branches.
