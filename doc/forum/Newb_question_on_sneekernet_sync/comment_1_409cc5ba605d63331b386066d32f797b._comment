Well, working with git annex, you should think of two things:

1. location of annex information (git commit tree), let's call it INFO
2. location of files contents, let's call it CONTENT

So, for your sneekernet scenario these general steps are required:

1. sync INFO between Laptop A and USB
2. transfer required CONTENT from LAPTOP A to USB
3. sync INFO between Laptop B and USB
4. transfer required CONTENT from USB to Laptop B

Let's describe your options on every step:

1. issue `git annex sync` on Laptop A. Either from within USB or Laptop repo, I prefer Laptop because of automatic commit.
2. 
   * issue `git annex copy <files> --to=<usb-remote-name>` from within Laptop A repo
   * issue `git annex get <files>` from within USB repo. This is not possible if you have bare repo on USB.
3. issue `git annex sync` on Laptop B
4. same as 2, but transfer to Laptop B

Also, using `git annex sync --content`, you don't need to manually transfer CONTENT, see [--content](https://git-annex.branchable.com/git-annex-sync/). But in this case you somewhat loose control of what is transferred.

If you make changes on both laptops at the same time no extra steps required. In case of conflict both versions saved in working directory, see [automatic conflict resolution](http://git-annex.branchable.com/automatic_conflict_resolution/).
