After some thought, perhaps the default fsck output should be at least machine readable and copy and pasteable i.e.

<pre>
$ git annex fsck
Files with errors

    file1
    file2

</pre>

so I can then copy the list of borked files and then just paste it into a for loop in my shell to recover the files. it's just an idea.
