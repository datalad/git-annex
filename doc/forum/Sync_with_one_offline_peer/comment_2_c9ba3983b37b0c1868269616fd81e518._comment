Yes, the rsync repository is not a git repository and so does not hold metadata. If you can install git-annex on your server, you can add a regular git repository there, and then the clients can sync to it even when the other is offline.

This is also why I an working on adding support for [[special_remotes/gcrypt]] repositories, so you can have a fully encrypted git repository on the server and sync through that.

I have never heard about such a problem. You should file a bug report with the details.
