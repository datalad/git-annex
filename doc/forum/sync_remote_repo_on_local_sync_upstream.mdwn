I am looking for a short cut for my workflow where I sync a (somewhat) central repo and a few client repos.

So, I sync upstream 

    laptop > git annex sync --content

and ssh to the central repo and run another sync

    server > git annex sync

to bring it up to date so that I can sync/pull it again from my desktop.

Is there an easy way to script/do both steps in one for different protocols? E.g., update a ssh repo and a USB-drive repo when syncing on the local one?

At the moment, I would try to check for all known remotes

    > git remote -v

and depending on the protocol ssh/cd into each for triggering a sync.
