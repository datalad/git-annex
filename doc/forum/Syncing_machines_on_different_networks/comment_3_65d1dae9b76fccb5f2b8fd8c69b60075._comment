You need two things:

1. A special remote in the cloud. S3, or rsync.net, or whatever.
2. A git repository hosted in the cloud. You could just use github (paying them if you want to avoid it being public).

Is it possible to have an encrypted git remote repository? It's not directly supported by git. The way git needs to be able to request arbitrary objects by SHA, kind of prevents encrypting things to any useful level. The only way I can think of to do that would be to use some cloud storage that can be mounted as a filesystem, and store an encrypted filesystem containing the git repo in a file inside that. Not easy.

The git-annex assistant is going to get around this by not requiring a central git repository and transferring git data peer-to-peer, but that will require both the peers be on the network at the same time.
