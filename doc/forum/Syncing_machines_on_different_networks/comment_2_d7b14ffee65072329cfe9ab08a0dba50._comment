That's what I've started to do. It gets the job done, but I don't like that I have to remember to plug in the stick and sync to it at the end of the work day, and then plug in the stick and sync from it when I get home. I'm hoping that there is some way to accomplish the syncing automagically, more akin to the Dropbox experience.
