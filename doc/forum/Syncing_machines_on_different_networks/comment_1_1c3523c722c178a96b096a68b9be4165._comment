I might be thinking too simple, but can't you just put another annex repository on an usbdrive and use it to carry the metadata around? Add it as a remote to both compuers annex repositories and sync when you come/leave. As it does not have to carry the actual data some 100M will usually suffice. Just don't use any special remotes, but simply a cloned git repository.
