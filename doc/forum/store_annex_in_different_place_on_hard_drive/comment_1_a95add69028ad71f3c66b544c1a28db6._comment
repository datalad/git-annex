You should avoid making two repositories that share the same .git/annex
or .git/annex/objects directories. Doing that can get git-annex confused,
and let it drop a file that is only located in one place .. because it sees
it existing in 2 places due to the symlink!

IIRC, git-annex supports making .git/annex a symlink to some directory
elsewhere, that is not itself used by another git repository.

Or, you can use standard `GIT_DIR` settings to make git 
(and git-annex) look for the .git directory elsewhere.
