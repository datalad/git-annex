I would just clone the repo to the new machine, do `git annex init`, and then rsync the contents of `.git/annex/objects`, and then do `git annex fsck --all` to have to recheck every key it knows about.

Alternatively, if you're concerned that there might be keys that weren't properly recorded somehow, in your new repo, after `.git/annex/objects` has been transferred, you can create an ingestion directory with a flat layout of the copied keys:

```bash
mkdir ingest && find .git/annex/objects -type f | xargs mv ingest && git annex reinject --known ingest/*
```

Finally, if you just want to rebuild it from scratch, do cp with the `-cL` option. If you are on macOS, it will make a reflink copy, and follow the symlinks. Delete the target .git dir and re-create it.
