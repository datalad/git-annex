Sounds like you're running the boto glacier command rather than the glacier-cli tool. Unfortunately they have the same name (my intention was to deprecate the boto tool but boto upstream deprecated boto entirely instead). The current plan is to rename glacier-cli to glcr, but I haven't got round to doing that yet.

Try making sure that \"glacier\" runs the glacier-cli tool rather than boto's glacier.
