Note that, since version 5.20150219, git-annex probes to see if the
"glacier" program in PATH is the one from boto, and fails with a nicer
error message.

The UnicodeDecodeError is mentioned in the thread for
[[special_remotes/glacier]] too. There is a workaround posted in that
thread. It would probably be good to nudge the boto maintainers to apply
the fix, which has been available for at least 3 months now.
