So, you provide ARM build. But you probably don't know that my NAS box runs OABI. No, you don't know, you can't know, and you shouldn't know. The only thing worth knowing is that writing great software in obscure and esoteric languages drastically limits its usage, impact, and collaboration around it. So, any idea of writing git-annex implementation in a sane, interpreted, "just works" language, e.g. Python? Thanks.
