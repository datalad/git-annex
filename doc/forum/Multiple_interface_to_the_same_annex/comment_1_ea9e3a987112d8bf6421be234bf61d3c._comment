Creating a separate special remote pointing to the same content is not a
good idea. This will confuse git-annex's location tracking, and in some
cases can lead to data loss, since git-annex will assume it can safely
delete a file from one of the "two" repositories, since it thinks the
"other" one will still have the content of the file.

Instead, you need a way to configure a regular git remote,
pointing at the repository, that is read-only, or is accessed over rsync,
or whatever your requirements are.
