After I created a git repository, I added annex to it.

Now, if I add a new file with 'git add', it goes into the annex.   However previously existing files are not in the annex.

What are the implications of this?   Should I care?

FWIW, most of the files are small, so I see no reason for the annex for them.

How do I add a new file and not put it in the annex?

How to I switch a file from one to the other?

Thanks.
