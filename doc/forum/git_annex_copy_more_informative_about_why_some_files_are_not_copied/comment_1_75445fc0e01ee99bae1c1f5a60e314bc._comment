I think that this behavior of git-annex is quite useful once you get used to it. It can sometimes trip up new users, but new users would not know about some --explain switch that made it say why it skipped each file. So, I consider this a documentation issue, and I've added a section to the walkthrough to help users learn about it:

<http://git-annex.branchable.com/walkthrough/quiet_please:_When_git-annex_seems_to_skip_files/>

As far as copy --from --to, it has been suggested before; I think there is even a todo about it somewhere, but such remote-to-remote transfers are expensive and I would hope it would not normally be used.
