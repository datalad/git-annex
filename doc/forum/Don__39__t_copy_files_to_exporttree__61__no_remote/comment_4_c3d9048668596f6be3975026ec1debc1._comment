The remote's `annex-tracking-branch` includes the sub-directory in my setup.

I did not mean that it ignores exporttree and actually exports files, it ignores it insofar that it attempts to copy to the remote but then fails because `exporttree=no`. Tonnes of:

```
copy Filename (to paperless...) 
  remote is configured with importtree=yes and without exporttree=yes; cannot modify content stored on it
failed
```

It shouldn't even attempt to do that, it will never work.

Some new info: After updating my NAS to NixOS 23.11, it is now also affected while it wasn't before on 23.05.
