Syncing doesn't work towards satisfying `numcopies`, just preferred content. So if you find files to be copied to the phone, then its preferred content matches those files. Maybe try `git annex wanted PHONE 'present or approxlackingcopies=1'` or just `git annex wanted PHONE present`. `nothing` is indeed not a good idea as that will have git-annex wanting to yank everything off the phone.
