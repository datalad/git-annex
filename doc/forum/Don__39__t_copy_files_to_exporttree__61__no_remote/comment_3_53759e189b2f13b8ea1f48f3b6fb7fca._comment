You have probably set remote.phoneremote.annex-tracking-branch to "master".
That tells `git-annex sync` to try to export the whole branch to that
remote.

If you are confining the phone to a subdirectory, you should set that
to eg "master:phonedir", then it will only consider files in that
directory.

> `exporttree=no`, it will provably never work

What do you mean by this? If git-annex sync 
ignored exporttree=no, that would be a bug. I just verified it honors that
setting.
