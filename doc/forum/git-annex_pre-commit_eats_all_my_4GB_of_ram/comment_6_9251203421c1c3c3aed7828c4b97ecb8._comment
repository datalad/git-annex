Thanks a bunch!  That is what I did now.  Seems good.

May I additionally suggest a change in the man page of git annex?  There I read

    sync [remote ...]
              ...
              The sync process involves first committing all local changes (git commit -a), ...
              ...

which made me think, I could do `git commit -a` manually as well.
