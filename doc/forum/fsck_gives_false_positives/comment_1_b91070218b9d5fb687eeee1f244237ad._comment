Well, it should only move files to `.git/annex/bad/` if their filesize is wrong, or their checksum is wrong.

You can try moving a file out of `.git/annex/bad/` and re-run fsck and see if it fails it again. (And if it does, paste in a log!) 

To do that -- 
Suppose you have a file `.git/annex/bad/SHA256-s33--5dc45521382f1c7974d9dbfcff1246370404b952` and you know that file `foobar` was supposed to have that content (you can check that `foobar` is a symlink to that SHA value). Then reinject it:

`git annex reinject .git/annex/bad/SHA256-s33--5dc45521382f1c7974d9dbfcff1246370404b952 foobar`
