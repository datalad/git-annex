The symlinks are in the git repository. So if the rsync damanged one, git would see the change. And nothing that happens to the symlinks can affect fsck.

git-annex does not use hard links at all.

fsck corrects mangled file permissions. It is possible to screw up the permissions so badly that it cannot see the files at all (ie, chmod 000 on a file under .git/annex/objects), but then fsck will complain and give up, not move the files to bad.
So I don't see how a botched rsync could result in fsck moving a file with correct content to bad.
