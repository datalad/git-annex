git-annex is first git, then some additional very neat functionality. Being git, it refuses to handle git repositories as that would create all kinds of potential confusion and inefficiency.

Submodules would be a way to go, if you like how they work. Or you could just ignore the git repos, as you probably have them replicated somewhere else.
