It seems to me you have a typo in the second line there.

The other problem I noticed is, you are putting repositories in groups, but you
never configure preferred content, and so the group settings will not be used.
So you probably want to run `git-annex wanted here standard` in each of the
repositories.

With those fixes, it seems to work for me.
