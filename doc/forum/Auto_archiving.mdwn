I've been toying with the idea of auto archiving files (that is - removing them from .) based on a set of rules.

Git already provides attribute management for files and I put together a simple script that tries to achieve the following:

* Look for files with X copies (including a local one)
* Verify that the file is not recent (defined as not having been dropped or getted within X days )
* Verify that the file has an annex.archive attribute
* Archive if the above is met

Here is the script:

You just add the annex.archive attribute to files via .gitattributes to use

The script runs in preview mode... exec with autoArchive.sh commit to drop the files.

Open to thoughts / suggestions
