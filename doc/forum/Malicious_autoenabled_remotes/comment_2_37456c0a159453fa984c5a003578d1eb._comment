Hey, thanks for the feedback and your thoughts. Should have gotten back to you sooner on this.

I wanted to share with you my thoughts about getting around this issue, from the point of view of the `trustedserver` administrator, and get your input on this.

I want to run a server that uses git and git annex for data storage. I want users of this server to feel safe that when they clone a repository and sync content, they're not pulling things from an untrusted server. I was thinking of modifying annex configurations serverside, perhaps as a *post-receive* hook. The idea would be to go through the remotes on the serveride, bare git repository, and mark all unknown (ssh, rsync, etc) remotes as a `dead`.

Would this cause any issues for the receiver or the sender? Other than potentially making files for the receiver unavailable (which is what I want), would it possibly put the repository in a state where the original sender can't push more changes, because of a disagreement between configurations?

I've played around with the idea a bit and I think the idea is pretty safe, but I might be missing something.

Thanks!

Achilleas
