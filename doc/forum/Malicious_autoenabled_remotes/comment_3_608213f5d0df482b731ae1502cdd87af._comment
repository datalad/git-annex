The server can certainly do filtering or blocking of changes to the
git-annex branch to prevent this kind of abuse.

Marking a repository as dead will indeed prevent it from being
auto-enabled. It will not cause later synchronisation problems. It seems
like a perhaps too big hammer though. Cloning from such a server, and then
pushing back to it would make your clone be marked as dead on the next
pull!

And marking dead doesn't prevent malicious changes to preferred
content settings etc.

Filtering in the `pre-receive` hook should be very doable. See
[[internals]] for the git-annex branch documentation.
