I want to use git-annex to manage some data which I keep at, say, /home/my_user/data .
I have multiple external storage devices for this repo, such as /run/media/my_user/data1 e

BUT, I also have multiple machines, e.g. my desktop and my laptop. 
These all have the data under /home/my_user/data, as I like to keep my paths consistent. 
So, when I connect my external media to these machines, practically they see the same repo path, though these are different repos.

1. Should I try to create multiple repos with the same path, or should I just add one

2. Can I expect any major issues from this set-up?
