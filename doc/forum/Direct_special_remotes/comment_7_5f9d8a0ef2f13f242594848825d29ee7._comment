The above scenario is also quite interesting to me. Similarly running and old OS (Debian 4.x) on a NAS, and it would be great to be able to access files directly (via direct mode) and manage via git annex, along with a true backup elsewhere. Mostly commenting so I'll get emails for further discussion here.
