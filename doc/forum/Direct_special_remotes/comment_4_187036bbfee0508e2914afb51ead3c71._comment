Thanks !

Before trying the CLI, I will install have a go with installing git-annex on the plug computer.

Do you know by any chance if version 3.20120629~bpo60+2 (the available version on squeeze-backport) will be compatible with the current latest release (4.20130405) ?

I guess I am asking if version 3 is compatible with version 4.
