And something else i've done is, that i symlinked the video/ directory from the media annex to the normal raid annex

    ln -s ~/media/annex/video ~/annex

And it's working out great.

    ~annex $ git annex whereis video/series/episode1.avi
    whereis video/series/episode1.avi(1 copy)
        	f210b45a-60d3-11e0-b593-3318d96f2520  -- Trantor - Media
    ok

I really like this, perhaps it is a good idea to store all log files in every repo, but maybe there is a possibilitiy to to pack multiple log files into one single file, where not only the time, the present bit and the annex-repository is stored, but also the file key. I don't know if this format would also be merged correctly by the union merge driver.
