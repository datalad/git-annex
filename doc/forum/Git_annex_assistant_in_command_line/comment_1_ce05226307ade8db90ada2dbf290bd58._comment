There is no difference between a repository created using the assistant and one created by hand. So you can just `git clone ssh://server/path` or `git remote add foo  ssh://server/path` and use it at the command line like any other repository.

The assistant interoperates perfectly with the command line; you can switch between them at will at any time.
