I updated git-annex on the server. I now *sometimes* get automatic two-way syncing to happen with assistant. But it is not really consistent or reliable. One thing that seems to consistently fail is when I drag and drop a file into the annex folder on the mac. When I drag filename.txt into ~/annex, and then run git annex sync, I get the message:

    $ git annex sync
    commit  
    On branch adjusted/master(unlocked)
    Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/adjusted/master(unlocked)'.
    Untracked files:
    	.DS_Store
    	filename.txt
    
    nothing added to commit but untracked files present
    ok
    pull u 
    ok
    pull origin 
    ok
