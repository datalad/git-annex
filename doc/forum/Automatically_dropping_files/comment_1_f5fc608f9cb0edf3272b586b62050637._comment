`git annex drop --auto` *does* automatically drop files that are not wanted, according to your preferred content settings.

If your preferred content for a repo is `metadata=tag=done`, then only files tagged \"done\" will be kept in the repository. 

Of course, files are only dropped if enough other copies can be verified to exist in other repositories..
