Ok, I checked and the index file was missing and not sure why, but I had to manually sync one time. So I had to go in the annex folder with the command line and make a \"git annex sync\". It works pretty well now, it seems not to automatically sync my data (have to force it with \"Sync Now\"), but at least I can sync data to my tablet and thats awesome :).
