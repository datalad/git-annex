I have the same problem.
I checked again, removed the previous annex/ directory and created a new annex repository from the webapp. No annex/.git/index file is created.

I then add a remore ssh server. The synchronisation fails with the error in the log: \"/storage/emulated/legacy/annex/.git/index: copyFile: does not exist (No such file or directory).\"

Running \"git annex sync\" solved the problem.
