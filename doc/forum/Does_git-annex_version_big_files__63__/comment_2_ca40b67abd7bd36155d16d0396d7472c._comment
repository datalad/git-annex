Hi

Thanks for the pointer.

The reason I asked about is that it says that \"git-annex allows managing files with git, without checking the file contents into git. \". So I was just trying to understand the mechanic behind the description. If it is not check into the git then probably it is not versioning the files. I assumed that it must be  merely a sync tool.
