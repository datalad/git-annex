Hi

I have one more follow up question.

So git-annex versions files as I understand. Is it possible to use it without file versioning and just use it as a sync tool. I realize that there are example scenarios to demonstrate it however I would like to disable versioning if possible because I am intending to use it on large folders with big binary type files.

thanks
