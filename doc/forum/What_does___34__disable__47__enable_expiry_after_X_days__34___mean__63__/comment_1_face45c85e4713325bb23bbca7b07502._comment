Well, let's see.. You've gone into the Configuration and picked "Unused
files". The full text in front of you is:

<pre>
Managing unused files

Old versions of files and deleted files can be preserved inside this repository.

This might be useful, if you ever need to access those old or deleted files. But they'll also use up disk space. There are three ways to deal with this

1. Set up a backup or archive repository, on a removable drive or in the cloud, and the unused files will be moved to it, freeing up space. 
   [Add a new repository]
2. Or, you can let unused files expire after a period of time. 
   [Disable expiry / Enable expiry] after [7] days. [Save changes]
</pre>

So yes, if I read only item #2, and possibly skip the first sentence of it
and look at only the "Disable expiry / Enable expiry",
it seems a litte confusing, possibly, but if I read the 2 paragraphs
of explaination above it, not so much?

What do you find confusing about this form as a whole?
