In an attempt to simplify my setup, I have been trying to setup an encrypted repository on a `rsyncd`-based server via [`git-remote-gcrypt`](https://git-annex.branchable.com/tips/fully_encrypted_git_repositories_with_gcrypt/), which would house the file history and the annexed files themselves. I cannot provide an SSH connection to the server, so the `rsyncd` method seemed appealing.

Using the rsync format url with "::" to signal the rsyncd method, the connection seems successful, but the initialization does not complete. 

```
git annex initremote gcrypt-rsyncd type=gcrypt gitrepo=rsync://***::a/test keyid=*** encryption=hybrid

initremote gcrypt-rsyncd (encryption setup) (to gpg keys: ***) gcrypt
 Decrypting manifest

Everything up-to-date

git-annex: git: createProcess: chdir: invalid argument (Bad file descriptor)
failed
initremote: 1 failed
```

Logs from the daemon show the following error:
```
rsync to a/test/annex/objects from ***
```

I don't know whether this error is imputable to `git-annex`, or `git-remote-gcrypt`, or my settings.
