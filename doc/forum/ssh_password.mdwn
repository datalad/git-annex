Currently I have my netbook running git annex and a raspberry pi as a remote storage set up as a git repository.  I currently have it set up so that from the terminal i can just do 'ssh pi@mypi -p XXX -C' and it has the password saved.  Currently I'm having a problem that any time I add a file to my annex folder on my netbook I have to reenter my password for ssh-askpass for it to upload the file.  Once that file is uploaded, it looks to me like it closes the connection and then reopens it and asks for my password again.

I'm looking in ~/.ssh/ and I'm sure that something there needs to be edited or copied, I'm not really sure what though.  Any suggestions?
