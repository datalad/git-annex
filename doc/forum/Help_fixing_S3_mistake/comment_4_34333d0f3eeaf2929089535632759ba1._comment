Actually, I suspect that I may have done more damage than I had initially thought.

Is there a way to check whether the repo still has information about a file's whereabouts, especially how it was chunked on an S3 remote?  I'm not sure if that information still exists or not.  If it doesn't exist anymore, then recovery is likely impossible.

If this information still exists in the repo, I can reconstitute the files by hand (script) if necessary and reinject them.  I'm assuming that I can decrypt them using my private key?
