Depends.. If one or both special remotes used encryption then no,
one can't see the encrypted files that were put in the other one.

If neither used encryption, and they're otherwise configured the same,
then you can just use `git annex fsck --from A`. This will check files
to see if their content is located on remote A, and if so, and git-annex
had thought the file was only located on remote B, it will update the location
tracking log to reflect the reality that the file is present on A.

If either remote used encryption, then A can't see files that were added
to B. So instead, you need this approach , which involves data transfer:

	git annex enableremote B
	git annex copy --from B
	git annex copy --to A
	git annex drop --from B
	git annex dead B # if it wasn't already dead
	git remote remove B
