Since this information about remotes is stored in your git repository, I
don't see how the repository could lose it. I mean, you might have to look
in the history if you've changed some value, like the chunking setting
from what it's supposed to be, in order to find the historical value, but
like anything checked into a git repository, it's there until you throw the
repository away or git-filter-branch the information out of existence.
