Well, you can certianly use --work-tree with git-annex. As a global git
option, it has to be passed after the "git" and before the "annex". However,
since the view is constructed by making symlinks to the annexed content,
the result will be a directory full of symlinks, rather than the contents
of the files. Also, it'll still update the repo  to think it has this view
checked out, with confusing results.

rsync seems to be a perfectly good way to do what you want, if you want
to have copies of the files.

Or, you might consider making a shared clone of the git repo wherever you 
want that tree of files, and checking out the desired view in the clone.
In a shared clone with a recent version of git-annex, running `git annex
get` will quickly hard-link the files from the main repo (when possible).
