I have git-annex set up with three clients and a transfer repository and everything was working fine, but a couple of days ago I noticed that git-annex was starting to upload to the transfer repository files that where already present on the three clients, and it hasn't stopped since. It's uploading all my files and I don't really know why.

Is there a way to know why does git-annex think it needs to upload this files?
