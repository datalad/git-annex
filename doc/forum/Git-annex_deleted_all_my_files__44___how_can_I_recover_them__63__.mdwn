I am trying to follow this guide:

https://git-annex.branchable.com/walkthrough/

I:

* created a repository
* added a remote
* added all the files via `git annex add .`
* commited my changes
* synced my repositories


By the time I tied to actually get the content from repo one into repo two (via `git annex get folder`) I noticed that all of my stuff had been deleted from repo one (and not backed up by git annex anywhere else!).

How can I get my stuff back?

Also, why would any software which is meant for backup (or any sane software in general) delete stuff without me actually typing `rm` or `delete` into the terminal and without giving me a big warning message and a confirmation prompt?
