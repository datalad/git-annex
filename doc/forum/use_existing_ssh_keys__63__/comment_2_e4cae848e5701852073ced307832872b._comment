I also found the key setup confusing. I have many identity files for several server / service combinations, so the webapp key setup for an ssh+rsync cloud server always failed with too many identification attempts before I had the sense to move my keys temporarily away from ~/.ssh

It would be really nice if the webapp would allow one either to pick an existing identity, or to create a new one with the aid of a couple of password logins.

Also, having the created key to be restricted to only running rsync in the server would improve the chances of 'Share with a friend' use case being used. I don't think many people will want to give out full shell access to their servers in order to share some files.
