Is there an argument against the original request of being able to use an existing *non-default* ssh key when setting up a remote ssh repo with the webapp?

As suggested above, one could reasonably have different identities, not all of which should have access to the git-annex repo. AFAIU, the way things are one has to either use their default identity with a remote ssh repo OR temporarily enable password authentication on the server so that the webapp will generate and install its own key, then turn it off. That is a tall order and might not even be possible if the server is not under the user's control. Am I missing something?
