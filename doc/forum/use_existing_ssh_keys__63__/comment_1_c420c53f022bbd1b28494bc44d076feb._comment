Hmm. The assistant already tries to cater to this case of having an existing key. When setting up a rsync or ssh remote, it first tries to ssh to the server without allowing a password to be prompted for. If this succeeds, it assumes you have a passwordless key and uses it. Otherwise, it sshes in once with a password prompt, and sets up its own key.
