`not copies=2` might be sufficient in your situation.

If you look at the preferred content expression for a transfer repository, it
is:

`not (inallgroup=client and copies=client:2) and ($client)`

Where `$client` is a copy of the preferred content expressions of the client.

There's no reason you can't write a preferred content expression that
does the same thing for some other group of repositories.
