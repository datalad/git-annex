Using the standard transfer group wouldn't work in this situation because the remotes cannot be clients (among other reason because the server repo is bigger than the external drives).

But from your answer I surmise that the local repo must want the files unless they are on the drives and no longer want them once they are on drives, is that correct?

I will try letting it run overnight with the local repo's wanted being `\"not copies=2\"`. Hopefully sync will drop the local copy as soon as it has been transferred to the drive and not keep that for last.
