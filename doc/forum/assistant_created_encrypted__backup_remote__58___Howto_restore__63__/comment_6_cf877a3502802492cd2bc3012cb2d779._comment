Right.

So, I think I should go change the description displayed by the webapp to \"full backup (file contents only)\" and \"full backup (entire git repository)\" or so. It's a little hard to word it precisely without making it hard to understand.

Or, the webapp could display a nudge to make a clone when no other clones of the git repository exist. I think that's probably more valuable, so [[todo_added|todo/webapp_nudge_when_less_than_numcopies_clones]].
