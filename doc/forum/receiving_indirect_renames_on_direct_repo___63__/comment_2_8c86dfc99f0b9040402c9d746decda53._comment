now, I went again through docs, and i realized how stupid was issuing a git pull on a direct repo. thanks for your patience.

but, i double checked the configuration, I assume \"receive.denyNonFastForwards\" is false by default, but anyway I set it up explicitely so that now my git config (on the linux indirect repo - with respect to my previous example, I got rid of the \"extra\" bare repo in the middle) shows:

    $ git config --list
    user.email=m@g.com
    user.name=michele
    core.repositoryformatversion=0
    core.filemode=true
    core.bare=false
    core.logallrefupdates=true
    annex.uuid=d084e0fd-95a7-4c98-a206-fbf2c85b779d
    annex.version=3
    receive.denynonfastforwards=false

still I am receiving the push refusal:

    M:\win>git annex sync
    commit
    ok
    pull origin
    ok
    push origin
    To ssh://michele@home/home/michele/casa
       ! [rejected]        master -> synced/master (non-fast-forward)
    error: failed to push some refs to 'ssh://michele@home/home/michele/casa'
    hint: Updates were rejected because a pushed branch tip is behind its remote
    hint: counterpart. Check out this branch and merge the remote changes
    hint: (e.g. 'git pull') before pushing again.

    failed
    git-annex: sync: 1 failed

Same happens with a bare repository in the middle. BTW: the windows \"client\" repository is behind NAT, so that the linux indirect doesn't actively sync against it: could that be source of the problem ?
