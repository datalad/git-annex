now, i tried to understand what happens. Instead of issuing the *git annex sync*, I relied on *git pull origin, git merge origin/master*, (I red [[http://git-annex.branchable.com/forum/Help_Windows_walkthrough/]] and I assume that pull origin / merge origin/master would work similarly to the \"download\" part of sync, *except for losing all my direct content*) just to understand what was going on, with a clarifying result:

while git annex sync fails on push, git pull origin fails on pull:

    M:\win>git pull origin
    Updating 5408d6f..c566a69
    error: Your local changes to the following files would be overwritten by merge:
            myfile
    Please, commit your changes or stash them before you can merge.
    Aborting 

note that the file has not been modified locally (just got it through git annex get).
issuing a git diff, reveals:

    M:\win>git diff myfile
    diff --git a/myfile b/myfile
    index beaf3e8..dc5b4ff 120000
    --- a/myfile
    +++ b/myfile

    +linux.1
    (END)

ok, i follow suggestion, and I perform a git stash. that still wouldn't suffice for git annex sync:

    M:\win>git annex sync
    commit
    ok
    pull origin
    ok
    push origin
    To ssh://michele@home/home/michele/homebase
     ! [rejected]        master -> synced/master (non-fast-forward)
    error: failed to push some refs to 'ssh://michele@home/home/michele/homebase'
    hint: Updates were rejected because a pushed branch tip is behind its remote
    hint: counterpart. Check out this branch and merge the remote changes
    hint: (e.g. 'git pull') before pushing again.
    hint: See the 'Note about fast-forwards' in 'git push --help' for details.
    failed
    git-annex: sync: 1 failed

now, i can perform instead a *git pull origin*, since I am confident my content is stashed.

    M:\win>git pull origin
    Updating 5408d6f..c566a69
    Fast-forward
     myfile => myfile.renamed | 0
     1 file changed, 0 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-)
     rename myfile => myfile.renamed (100%)

merge is not doing anything more: at this stage content has gone (file is a direct-mode symlink nad it cannot be fixed by fsck). 
But i can recover it from stash (and I must do it unless I want to get the annex to think i still have content).

    git stash apply 

voil√†: the content is there! and the repos seems in good order. 
this only adds up that this is possibily a bug in the fact that git reports direct content as modified when indeed it hasn't been modified: but this affects git annex sync only when merging renaming files.
git annex sync now works perfectly .

to sum it up, I have two questions: 

1) does using stash to circumvent the problem expose me to any risk ?
2) would the behaviour on receiving renames in the abovementioned situation worth to be signaled as a bug ?
