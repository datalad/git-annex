First of all, I understand this is more a nas-related issue rather than a git-annex-related one, so thank you for your support and valuable software.

But I'm still struggling with this error.

Now I've reinstalled git on the NAS and, as previously, I can run every git command when I'm logged in.
But when I try to sync my PC with the git remote on the NAS, then I get this error:


    git annex sync
    sh: git-annex-shell: command not found
    sh: git-upload-pack: command not found
    fatal: Could not read from remote repository.
    
    Please make sure you have the correct access rights
    and the repository exists.
    commit  
    ok
    git-annex: no branch is checked out

Can this be really related to some access right? What user is git annex using when syncing with an SSH remote (e.g. admin) ? the one I specified when setting up the remote? where is it complaining about git-upload-pack non found, on the nas or on the PC I'm syncing from?
