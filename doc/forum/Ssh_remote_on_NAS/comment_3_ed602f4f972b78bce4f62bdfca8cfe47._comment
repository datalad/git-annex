I don't think it was a good idea to remove git from the NAS. To set up a git remote, you necessarily need to have git installed on the remote.

`git annex` should work as long as git-annex is somewhere in PATH -- unless your build of git is very strange and does not check PATH for git-foo commands.
Even if this was the case, you could run `git-annex` instead.
