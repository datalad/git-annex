How did you set your PATH? Note that the bash shell provides a lot of dotfiles which you can set the PATH in -- and reuses to read any single one of them when a noninteractive login is made to run a command.

It might help to install git on the NAS. It's included in the git-annex tarball, but not in a way that will put it on PATH; only in a way that will let git-annex use it.
