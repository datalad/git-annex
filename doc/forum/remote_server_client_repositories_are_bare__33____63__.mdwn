I've gone through most of the screen casts and lots of documentation,
but my first attempt produced an unexpected result.

I wanted to use git-annex is a Dropbox-simplistic setting - syncing
a directory between my notebook (OSX) and my desktop (OpenSUSE 12.3).
Running the assistant on OSX and adding a "Remote server" repository,
changing the repository group to client produced a bare repository
on the desktop.

Am I missing something obvious?

I've tried a few different version of git-annex, most recently

   git-annex version: 4.20130727-g9399845
   build flags: Assistant Webapp Pairing Testsuite S3 WebDAV Inotify DBus XMPP

but it remains the same.
