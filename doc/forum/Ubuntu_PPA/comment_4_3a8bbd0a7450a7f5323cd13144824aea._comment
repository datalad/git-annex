My work preinstalled Ubuntu machine is now on Raring, and even there the version of git-annex is only 3.20121112ubuntu3; too old to have the webapp option enabled :/ The two PPAs mentioned here aren't configured to build for Raring, so even though the one from François has a build from May 1st (7 days ago), it doesn't help me ;)

François: mind updating your PPA to support Raring? Thanks much if you do!

Either that, or I'll take the time some day to do a proper install on this machine (read: Debian). ;-)
