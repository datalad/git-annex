I have just done a sync in a direct mode repo:

    git-annex sync sshremote

It has quite a few conflicts (both sides adding the same file with same content). But somehow the merge won't conclude. Here's some log:

    $ git-annex sync sshremote
    commit  ok
    pull sshremote 
    warning: no common commits

I waited for a few minutes, and checked that both cpu and disk activity is near zero on both server. So I interrupted it, thinking it might be some locking issue. 

But now I cannot sync with the remote anymore because the merge is still in process. How should I resolve the conflicts? I could do it manually if I cannot use annex's auto merge.

    $ git-annex sync sshremote
    commit  ok
    pull sshremote 

    fatal: You have not concluded your merge (MERGE_HEAD exists).
    Please, commit your changes before you can merge.

    $ git merge --abort
