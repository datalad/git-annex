Version 5.20151019 is right between the two versions given, and probably
contains the reason for the drop in performance: That version started
checksumming files after receiving them to verify that their content is
good.

If so, this will get back the old level of performance:

	git config annex.verify false

If the performance problem were actually related to the new progress
display, passing --quiet will disable that display. If you can show that
simply passing --quiet speeds up transfers significantly somehow,
I'd be happy to investigate further.

@umeboshi I don't think your comment is really related to the original question.
If you run gets of a bunch of files in parallel, and two of the files
have the same content, you can get this situation where a transfer of
the content is already in progress.
