Gus, did you manage to recover from the situation?

I did some experimenting to see what it looks like when this happens.
Here I am in a filesystem with 76 mb free, and annex.diskreserve is set to
75 mb. The "big" file is 100 mb in size:

	joey@darkstar:~/mnt/r2>git pull
	remote: Enumerating objects: 5, done.
	remote: Counting objects: 100% (5/5), done.
	remote: Compressing objects: 100% (3/3), done.
	remote: Total 3 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 0
	Unpacking objects: 100% (3/3), 328 bytes | 328.00 KiB/s, done.
	From /home/joey/tmp/bench/r
	   2dc7cd3..3699920  master     -> origin/master
	Updating 2dc7cd3..3699920
	Fast-forward
	 big | 2 +-
	 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+), 1 deletion(-)
	 mode change 120000 => 100644 big
	  not enough free space, need 100.99 MB more (use --force to override this check or adjust annex.diskreserve)
	  not enough free space, need 101 MB more (use --force to override this check or adjust annex.diskreserve)
	git-annex: unable to populate worktree file ./big
	  not enough free space, need 101.02 MB more (use --force to override this check or adjust annex.diskreserve)
	git-annex: git status will show big to be modified, since content availability has changed and git-annex was unable to update the index. This is only a cosmetic problem affecting git status; git add, git commit, etc won't be affected. To fix the git status display, you can run: git update-index -q --refresh big
	  not enough free space, need 101.02 MB more (use --force to override this check or adjust annex.diskreserve)

This is only a cosmetic problem affecting git status; git add, git commit, etc won't be affected. To fix the git status display, you can run: git update-index -q --refresh big

So git-annex avoids filling up the entire disk in this situation
when annex.diskreserve is configured. I suppose that you don't have
it configured, so it defaulted to only 1 mb -- and then other
things than unlocked files used up that remaining space.

I've opened to todo that would have avoided the worst of
your experience:
[[todo/prevent_pulling_unlocked_files_using_all_disk_space_by_default]].
