Since unlocking makes a change to a file that git can commit,
you can certianly find the commit that made this change if you look hard
enough. Probably not one of the merge commits themselves, but one of the
commits that was merged. I'd maybe try `git log -u` on a file that I know
has otherwise not changed for a while. When the diff shows
that the mode of the file has changed from 120000 to 100644,
that's the change from a locked symlink to an unlocked file.

To disable the smudge/clean filters, edit `.git/config`
and delete the block of config under `[filter "annex"]`
