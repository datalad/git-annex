I think that the documentation of [[git-annex-unlock]] is pretty clear
about this:

       Unlocking a file changes how it is stored in the git repository
       (from a symlink to a pointer file), so this command will make
       a change that you can commit.

To get the equivilant of the old direct mode, where files are unlocked in
one repository without affecting other clones, use `git-annex adjust --unlock`.
