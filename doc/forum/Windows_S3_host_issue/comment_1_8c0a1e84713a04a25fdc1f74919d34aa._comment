No, you cannot quote part of a parameter like that. git-annex thinks you are trying to use a host that includes the quote marks you put around it. 

Since you're using Windows, I can't give any advice on how to use quoting at the shell/cmd prompt. However, I don't see any need for quoting here anyway.
