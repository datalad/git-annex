Hi,

git provides a neat way to create archives of git repos (or parts thereof): git bundle.

git bundle obviously works with git annex as well, BUT those bundles don't include the actual content (in other words, only the symlinks are bundled up).

Is there a way to get the git bundle functionality with git annex?

THX & Cheers,
Toby.
