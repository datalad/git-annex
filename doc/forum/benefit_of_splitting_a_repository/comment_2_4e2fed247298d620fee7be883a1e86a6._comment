The biggest problem I am facing actually is the git pack-objects command, which takes forever. 

I am not starting it manually, but \"git annex sync\" is. 

Any advice on how to make this faster?
Does it make sense at all to pack a bunch of uncompressible simlinks?

I already tried the delta=false attrigute, without any (major) effect.
