There are two possibilities:

1. Transfer repositories want files that have not yet reached all clients, so
   maybe you had a second client repository that doesn't have the file yet.

2. When there is only a single client repository, transfer repositories
   want to contain all content, even once it's reached that client. The
   assumption is that, since the purpose of a transfer repo is to transfer
   between clients, there will be a second client repository added at some
   point, and then the trasfer repository will have the content to send it it.

This is documented in [[preferred_content/standard_groups]].
