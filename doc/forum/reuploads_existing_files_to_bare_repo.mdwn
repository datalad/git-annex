I created a bare repo on a small always on server and synced it with my desktop.

Now, when I sync it with my laptop, annex on the laptop reuploads all files, which were already uploaded by the desktop. I see that because annex on the laptop fills the upstream even though the bare repo on the server does not take more harddisk space while this happens.

Is this by design and why?
