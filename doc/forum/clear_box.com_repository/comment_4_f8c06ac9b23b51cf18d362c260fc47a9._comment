Hi, I cannot enable debug logging via webapp, because after restart the checkbox is unchecked again. I saw nothing at all in logs after restart, the box repo is still hanging there. I would prefer using command line to remove the last traces of this repository. 
Another similar question - how do I unassociate two repositories? The web app warns me that about deleting repo, not sure if it would also wipe it out. Is there a CLI command to add and remove the associations (git remote rm?)? Overall great work, but I am lost with the webapp. It is good for learning the concepts, but I would love to know which commands it actually executes on the backend to make the gui -> cli transition easier.
