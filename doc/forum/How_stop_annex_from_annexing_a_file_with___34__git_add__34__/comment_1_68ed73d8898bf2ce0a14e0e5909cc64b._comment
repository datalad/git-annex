Here's an example of what I see:
```
Hermes ~/kadena/docs $ w
## main
?? archive/
Hermes ~/kadena/docs $ git add archive
Hermes ~/kadena/docs $ git diff HEAD
diff --git c/archive/archive.org w/archive/archive.org
new file mode 100644
index 0000000..6cd5281
--- /dev/null
+++ w/archive/archive.org

```

Note that I discovered that I had both a `kadena.org` and an `archive/kadena.org`. Once I renamed the latter to `archive/archive.org`, then I was able to `git add` the first file without it being placed in the Annex, but I still cannot add `archive/archive.org` without it being put into the Annex as above.
