The two problems are: Read-only directory, and wanting a clone that doesn't
have the same directory structure.

For the read-only directory, you may be able to use a direct mode
repository. You might need to set `GIT_DIR` in the environment to make
the .git directory be placed somewhere outside the read-only directory.

As to wanting different directory structure in your clone, it's an added
complication I'd recommend avoiding. Not that it's impossible, you can move
files around in the git repository and that could be automated via
git-filter-branch or the like. But git-annex offers a simpler solution,
which is to use the same directory structure and only get the contents of
files in the subdirectories you want.
