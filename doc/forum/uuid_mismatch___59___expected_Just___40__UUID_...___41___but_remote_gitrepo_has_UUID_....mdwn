Hi,

After reinstalling my laptop with the same GPG keys, I've got this error during re-syncing a remote crypted repo :

```
Internal Server Error
; expected Just (UUID "e7fc2bc8-b630-5eeb-a0b3-b4806d7ab064") but remote gitrepo has UUID "e2f02805-eae7-5bb8-875e-c901ba9929b1" (":id:SCPxErEQVlqp+Hl6Su0f")
```

Then, I can see the structure of the hard links in the local directory but pointing to nothing ?

Could you please help me ? 
Those data are critical, thanks for your great app and your help!

Guillaume
