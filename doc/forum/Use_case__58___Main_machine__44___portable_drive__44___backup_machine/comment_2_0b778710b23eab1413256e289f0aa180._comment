Use git-annex repositories on both the laptop and the thumb drive.

You can start by setting up the repository on the thumb drive,
and then git clone it to the laptop.

Use `git annex direct` to make them use direct mode, so that
files can be edited.

You can run the git-annex assistant in the repository on the laptop
(~/annex is the usual place for such a repository). This way
changes to files there will automatically be committed to git.

There's not currently a good way to have the assistant also commit
any files that were added to the thumb drive, or merge in changes
from the laptop to the thumb drive. Running the assistant in the repository
on the thumb drive would take care of both, but fails when the thumb
drive gets unplugged.

What you can do is write a simple shell script to sync up the thumb drive.
Something like this:

	#!/bin/sh
	set -e
	cd /media/thumbdrive
	git annex add
	git annex sync -m "syncing thumb drive"
