How many copies have you configured git-annex to keep of each file?

If it's 1 copy, the clients should be able to contact the server, see that
it has the file, and drop it as it's in the achive folder. But if 2 copies
are needed, neither client can verify that the other client has a copy, so
both will hold onto their own copy for safety.
