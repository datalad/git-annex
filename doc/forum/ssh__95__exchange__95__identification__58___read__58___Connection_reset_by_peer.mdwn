I setup a local git annex repo and tried to pair it with an empty repo on my notebook. All done via the webapp.

But pairing failed somehow, because I get this error while transfer seems to go on forever.

    ssh_exchange_identification: read: Connection reset by peer
    ssh_exchange_identification: read: Connection reset by peer
    fatal: Could not read from remote repository.

    Please make sure you have the correct access rights
    and the repository exists.

The webapp shows the remote repo as "unfinished repository".

I can access the other computer via ssh and an other git-annex repo pairing between the two computers work fine.

UPDATE: In the meantime I setup another paired repo on these two computers. Everything works fine. 

I added the repos from scratch again and the same errors occurs again. The repositories which do not pair are the Documents folder on my desktop and on my macbook. Is there something special with macs documents folder?

    Please make sure you have the correct access rights
