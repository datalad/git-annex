Thing is that `unregisterurl` does not mark content as not present in a
special remote. Except for the web which is a special case. Reason is
that not having an url registered by a special remote does not prevent getting
content from that special remote in general.

So my idea for `--move-from=foo` was that it should behave the same way
since it's the same as `registerurl + unregisterurl`.

If you're going to remove/disable the special remote anyway, it won't
matter whether git-annex thinks it contains content, I suppose? Or you
could use setpresentkey of course.
