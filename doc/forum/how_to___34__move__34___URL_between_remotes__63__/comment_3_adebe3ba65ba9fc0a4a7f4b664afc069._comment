The commands you would need do all support --batch, so it seems very
scriptable.

I'm struggling a bit with the idea of a dedicated git-annex command for
this, because it seems a fairly unusual situation.

Maybe `git-annex registerurl could have a switch that says to move urls
from remote foo to the web special remote? That would avoid needing to
query for the urls.

	git-annex registerurl --move-from=foo $key

Since registering an url also marks it present, all you would need after
that is to mark it as not present any longer on your special remote.
