> `git-annex registerurl --move-from=foo $key`

looks good

> Since registering an url also marks it present, all you would need after that is to mark it as not present any longer on your special remote.

it is `--move-from`, not `--copy-from`, so wouldn't it mark it not present any longer on `foo`?
