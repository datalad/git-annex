in theory - yes. In practice, ATM I would probably just `git annex whereis | awk -e \"/^ *$remote:/{print $2;}\"` or alike in bash, and in Python it would be quite trivial to filter for a specific remote. 
The main \"hurdle\" here would be the need to do that dance with registerurl/unregisterurl and given that we might need to do that for many thousands keys (imaging going through such repos as [dandizarrs](https://github.com/dandizarrs)), I felt like some internal dedicated function would be worthwhile.
