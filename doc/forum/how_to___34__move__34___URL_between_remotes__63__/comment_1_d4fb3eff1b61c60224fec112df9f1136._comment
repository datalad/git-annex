I see you're using CLAIMURL. What `git-annex addurl` does when a special
remote claims an url is it records the url for the key in the git-annex
branch, but mangled to indicate that it is not an url used by the web
special remote.

The mangling is just to prefix the url with ":".

If you `git-annex registerurl --remote=web` the same url again
but without that prefix, and  
`git-annex setpresentkey $key 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001 1`,
the url will will able to be downloaded by the web special remote. 

Then you can unregisterurl the (unmangled) url from your remote that you no
longer want to use, and use setpresentkey with your remote's uuid and "0" to
remove the mangled url.

I don't think there's any plumbing currently that makes it easy to access
and demangle the urls. `git-annex whereis --json` will list the demangled
url in the "urls" field, but in amoung any other urls that other special
remotes might have for the same content. Without --json there is a nice
display that shows the remote that claims the url:

	joey@darkstar:~/tmp/bench/rx>git-annex whereis
	whereis foo (1 copy)
	  	177d51e9-a115-443e-8100-49588f8a6ca2 -- foo [test]
	
	  test: http://example.com/foo.test

Improving the whereis --json or adding some other machine-readable 
way to list urls claimed by a remote seems like maybe worth doing?
Let me know.
