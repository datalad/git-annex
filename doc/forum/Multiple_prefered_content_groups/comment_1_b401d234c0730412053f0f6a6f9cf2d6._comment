What git-annex actually does when a repository is in multiple groups
is that the "standard" preferred content expression has no effect.
Because this is an ambiguous configuration and it's not clear what you
want.

I don't think that you can combine preferred content expressions for
multiple groups and always get behavior that makes sense. In particular,
it seems likely that in some situations you'd want to combine them with AND
but in other situations with OR.

So, the best thing for you to do is probably to manually write a preferred
content expression that clearly expresses what you want. Note that you
can have a repository that's in the archive group, but instead of "standard"
has its own custom preferred content expression. In your case, I think you
want to do that; keeping the repository in the archive group will retain
the behavior of other repositories dropping archived files once they reach
it.

Seems that for the preferred content setting for this repositry, you
want the same one used for backup repositories, "anything".

So:

	git annex group . archive
	git annex ungroup . backup
	git anenx wanted . anything
