I don't see any need to scrap the repository. Since you have an indirect mode repository, you can use `git log` in there to find commits you don't like, and run `git revert` to revert them. So if a bad commit comes down from windows, you can just undo it. That's why we use git, yes?

I'm much more curious about the circumstances that cause empty files to end up in the direct mode repository.
