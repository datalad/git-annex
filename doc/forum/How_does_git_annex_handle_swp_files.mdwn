Sometime I edit a file with lets say Emacs in the work directory which is synced with all my other computers. Then there is this .something.swp file. This is put into the queue for sync, but if I close this before it starts the sync I get an error since the file is now gone. Then I get a failed message in the webapp. This is slightly annoying. Is there a way to fix this in some way. I can of course disable the swp use, but this is default for different programs. Is there a way to exclude files? For instance all .swp files from ever getting synced?
