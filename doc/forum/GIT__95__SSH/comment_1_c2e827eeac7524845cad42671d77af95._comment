I've added support for this now.

However, since git's interface to this doesn't let any options other than
-p be passed to the command run by this, git-annex can't either. Which
means it can't pass options for ssh connection caching. So, I'm afraid that
using `GIT_SSH` will slow things down somewhat. Of course, you can always
enable ssh connection caching yourself in either the `GIT_SSH` script or
the ssh configuration.
