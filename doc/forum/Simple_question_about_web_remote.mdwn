Hello. I have been having some trouble with downloading podcasts. I have read the guide, but I was getting the following error message:

```
  verification of content failed

  Unable to access these remotes: web

  Try making some of these repositories available:
  	00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001 -- web
failed
git-annex: get: 1 failed
```
I have tried several times. Some times it seemed to work, others it did not â€” it was not very structured, so I do not recall the details. Recently I recreated the entire stuff from scratch and was downloading files, and after I upgraded to 6.20160318 it stopped working and just gives me the error message above, after downloading the file.

I tried looking up information about the web remote, but it mentions nothing about "making the web remote available" or something that I found to address this subject. So I am confused. What is wrong with my web repository? Why did it stop working? How can I fix it? How can I prevent this from happening in the future? Thank you.

Here is the version information:
