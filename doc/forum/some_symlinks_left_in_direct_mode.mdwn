Dear all,
   I have a repository in direct mode which still has some symlinks pointing to .git/annex/objects. Is there a way to turn them back into regular files. I don't recall why this happen, I guess I started on indirect mode and after that I converted it to direct mode.
Thanks in advance.
Best regards,
              Juan
