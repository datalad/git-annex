If using git-annex sync or git-annex merge to do the merging, it will
automatically resolve the merge conflict and put both conflicting versions
of the file in the tree under different filenames.

Of course, you can also use regular git commands to pull and merge your
master branch; then you'd get a regular git merge conflict.
