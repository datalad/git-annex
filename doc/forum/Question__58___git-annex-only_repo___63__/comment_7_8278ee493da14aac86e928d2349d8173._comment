git-annex doesn't deliberately keep all versions of the files. however, if you change a file (using [[git-annex-edit]]), it will keep the old copy, which will become [[walkthrough/unused_data/]]. that data will be purged by the assistant after a while (if configured to do so) but you can also archive it, etc... 

so in a way, yes, it is versionned, but the unused data is somewhat more 'brittle' than the current dataset.
