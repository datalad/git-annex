If you use indirect mode, and avoid passing --force to any git-annex
commands, then git-annex will ensure that it always keeps all versions of
all files.

Any command that would delete any data requires the --force option.

If your repo uses direct mode, we can't make this guarantee, because
the files are left directly in your work tree and you can edit or delete
them manually and there's nothing git-annex can do to stop that.

There is not currently a way to keep a particular number of old versions of
a file. This comes down to picking the versions to keep or drop when
running `git annex dropunused` (with --force of course).
