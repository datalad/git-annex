Does a armhf binary tarball exist anywhere? I'm running Ubuntu trusty on a armhf platform (beagleboard), and the repository package is out of date. I might try to get the standalone armel binary working using multiarch, but that seems only slightly less painful than compiling from scratch.

Or am I better off changing to a debian boot image, and be done with it?
