One way to do this is to switch to a different branch. Then, deletion
of a file won't propigate to other repositories, that don't have that
same branch checked out.

Or, see <http://git-annex.branchable.com/tips/file_manager_integration/>
-- file managers can be taught to run `git annex drop` rather than deleting
files. Perhaps xbmc/kodi could be too..
