Aha! I had been fumbling trying to find the right way to do this. Looks very promising. Found the documentation for the file format: <http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/General/Reference/InfoPlistKeyReference/Articles/CoreFoundationKeys.html>

Where do I install this thing? If I put the git-annex.app directory inside ~/Desktop/, will that put it on the user's desktop?

Could you make a screenshot?

I'm guessing that the NSAppleScriptEnabled is not needed, and perhaps the LSMinimumSystemVersionByArchitecture block could also be removed.
