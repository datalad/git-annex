Thinking this out a little, I reckon the script _MacOS/git-annex_ could be a bit more clever and get the basedir/basename of where it app is and execute git-annex from the .app bundle, then you wouldn't need to install it as root at all. It would require a bit of work to collect the executables needed.

Also, I just quickly checked my Lion install, it seems to come with git and uuidgen once xcode and the command line tools are installed.
