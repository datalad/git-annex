This is a documented behavior change in v6 mode. I'm willing to listen to
arguments that the behavior change is a bad idea, but see below.

To get the old behavior, you can use:

	git -c 'annex.largefiles=exclude=*' add

Unfortunately git won't let you alias git add to always pass that
switch. But you could alias `git sadd` or something to use that switch.

----

The same behavior change also makes `git commit -a` use git-annex when file
contents have changed, rather than the old hacky method which added the
files to git and then undid that in a pre-commit hook. So there's quite a
nice benefit there.

And for that reason it doesn't make sense to add a configuration option to
disable it, because such an option would break `git commit -a` of
modified annexed files.

Changing the gitattributes won't work because then the v6 repository won't
get annexed files checked out properly.
