OK, I should have read more before writing.

It seems like the procedure is described here:
http://git-annex.branchable.com/walkthrough/unused_data/

The process is:
1. rm files or directories
2. git annex sync in all remotes (that is a pain, I wish I only had to do it once)
3. git annex unused
4. git annex dropunused
5. Repeat 4 and 5 on any repository where the data is stored

That does work for me, it is just slightly cumbersome. If there is another way or if I am missing something, please let me know.

Thanks,

Mike
