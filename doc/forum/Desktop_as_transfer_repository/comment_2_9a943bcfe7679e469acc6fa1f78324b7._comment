I suspect that if you run `git annex drop --auto` on desktop, it won't drop
any files. This is because it's configured as a transfer repository, and
transfer repositories wait for files to reach all client repositories
before wanting to drop them.

Since you have no client repositories, your transfer repository will prefer
to hang onto files. In fact, transfer repositories assume there will
eventually be at least 2 client repositories (otherwise what good would a
transfer repository between clients be?) and so hang onto files that are
not in 2 clients, even when less than 2 clients exist yet. That is generally
useful behavior when setting things up in eg the webapp.

So, the standard preferred content expression for a transfer repository
won't work in this configuration. Let's instead express the things you want
as a custom setting.

	git annex wanted desktop "not (inallgroup=backup and inallgroup=client)"

That assumes you put the raspberrypi in the client group, which is what I think it
basically is. Then desktop will want to get and hold any files that
have not yet reached all backup and client repositories, at which point
desktop will drop files.
