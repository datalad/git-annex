Ok,

here is my current workflow to clarify my problem:

On raspberrypi:

    Adding new podcasts
    git annex sync

On desktop:

    git annex sync
    git annex get --want-get

New podcast content from raspberrypi is downloaded.

In backup:

    git annex sync
    git annex get --want-get

New podcast content from desktop is downloaded.

On desktop:

    git annex drop

Everything on desktop is dropped.

**Now the problem**

Next time I do 

    git annex get --want-get

on **desktop** all files are downloaded again from either backup or raspberrypi.

What can I do to have only content in desktop that is not in the raspberrypi repository or in the backup repository? 

I thought that this is the behaviour of a transfer repository.
