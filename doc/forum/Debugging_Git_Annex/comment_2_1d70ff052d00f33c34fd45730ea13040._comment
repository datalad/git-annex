Hi,

I want to replace rsync with aspera-rsync. Whenever there is file transfer between 2 repositories which are in two different hosts, git-annex will use rsync protocol. I am trying to replace that rsync call with aspera-rsync so that transfer can be more faster. Since I am new to Haskell I am finding difficulties to understand the flow of execution. Is there any way I can debug so that I can get the flow?

Thanks
