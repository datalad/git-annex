For importing your photos, you can use `git annex import /path/to/some/photos` .. this will move them from the given location into the current directory, and add them to the annex. It preserves subdirectory structure too.

For using the OSX app at the command line, the only thing that is guaranteed to work properly is to run `/Applications/git-annex.app/Contents/MacOS/runshell`, which will modify your PATH and other environment appropriately.
