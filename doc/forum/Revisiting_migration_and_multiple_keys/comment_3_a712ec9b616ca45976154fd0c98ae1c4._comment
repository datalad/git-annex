I wonder if it would suffice to have a way for git-annex to record that key
A migrated to B, but not treat that as meaning that it should get B's
content when it wants A, or vice-versa.

Instead, when a repository learns that A was elsewhere migrated to B, it
could hardlink its content for A to B and update the location log for
B to say is has a copy. The same as if `git-annex migrate` were run locally.
(It could even hash the content and verify it got B.)

That wouldn't help if a special remote has the content of A, and 
git-annex wants to get the content of B.
