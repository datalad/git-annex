Thanks joey!

Sorry missed `cabal install c2hs` in the instruction. But got passed that and still can't install.

    Resolving dependencies...
    Configuring libxml-sax-0.7.3...
    cabal: The pkg-config package libxml-2.0 is required but it could not be found.
    cabal: Error: some packages failed to install:
    git-annex-3.20121127.1 depends on libxml-sax-0.7.3 which failed to install.
    libxml-sax-0.7.3 failed during the configure step. The exception was:
    ExitFailure 1
    network-protocol-xmpp-0.4.4 depends on libxml-sax-0.7.3 which failed to install.

I tried

    brew install libxml2
    cabal install libxml

Also I added $HOME/.cabal/bin to my path

Thanks,

Carlito
