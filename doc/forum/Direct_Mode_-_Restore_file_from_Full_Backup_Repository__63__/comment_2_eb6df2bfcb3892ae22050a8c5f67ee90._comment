Thanks Joeyh, of course i guess checking stuff in git would then lose my timestamps as in the previous post. I recommend, as a feature request, to make file recovery a bit easier if possible. I'm not a git expert and definitely wont use command line stuff for doing this on the long run, unless some more intuitive commands like \"git annex list-old-versions\" or \"git annex show-deleted\" and then \"git annex restore \"filename\" version_no  etc.
