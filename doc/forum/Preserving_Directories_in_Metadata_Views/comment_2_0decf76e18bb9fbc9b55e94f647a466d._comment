Seems like there is a way to use git annex as I would like, though it may not be obvious.

In order to organize files and then burn them on to BDXL, instead of using tags, I've just switched to a new branch.
e.g.:

```sh
git checkout -b view/bdxl
```

and then moved files and folders to a new folder which I intend to burn later. I've also assigned `git annex tag bdxl-disk-1 . --force` directly in this folder, so later I can see which files are burned even on the main branch (because tags are tied to git annex content and shared across branches).

P.S.: In any case, preserving the folder structure on the first `git annex view tag=*` may be much more powerful and intuitive.
