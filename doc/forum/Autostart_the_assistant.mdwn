Hello,

I'm using the Arch git-annex package: https://www.archlinux.org/packages/community/x86_64/git-annex/

Checking the autostart checkbox in the assistant's web interface has no effect. There is no git-annex desktop file in ~/.config/autostart/ or alike. Neither is one contained in the package, however in the tarball I haven't found either.

How does autostarting the assistant works?

Best Thanks!
