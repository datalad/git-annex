Greetings friends.

In an unfortunate event, I lost my git repository for my annex. 😬

The only thing left is the annex files in an S3 bucket.

Is it possible to recover the repository?

Is it possible to recover the files?

All the files in S3 bucket are in this format:
GPGHMACSHA1--000b36e47d7ebd51f5ca2b8d294dea2d530c79c8

I'd appreciate any help! 🙏
