Consider the following scenario:

- A Server which holds the full repository
- A Laptop with a small disk, cloned the repository

Now when i am online i'd just like to mount the repository from the server on over to the client, shadowing the local repository. But when offline and the server is not
mounted the local repository takes place.

The Question is now what would be a viable concept to get this right. Especially will the assistant become confused when it runs on the server side and locally on the laptop
while the mount is in effect. Would it be sensible not to mount the whole repository tree but only parts like `.git/annex` or `.git/annex/objects`?

Not tried this yet, but I am wondering whats the most viable approach would be.
