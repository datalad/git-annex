I've been trying to get all image files added to git annex with a wildcard, with no luck. If I use 'git annex add image.jpg', the file gets added and I can commit it. Also using 'git annex add .' works for adding all files. 

Comands I've tried-

git annex add *.jpg     * This outputs to the screen that it's adding each .jpg it finds, but when I go to commit there are 0 files staged.

git annex add . --include='*.jpg'   * This doesn't return any results.


What command should I be using on a Mac to just add all files with a specific extension?
