The web app used to be unresponsive without manual refreshes.  Now it's all snappy and responsive and quickly reflects what the assistant is doing.

It used to be a complete crapshoot whether the assistant actually shut down when you told it to (either on the command line or through the webapp).  I used to have to manually kill leftover assistants and child processes routinely.  Now... you want it gone, and it's gone instantly, every time.

Something really good happened with this last version, thank you joey!
