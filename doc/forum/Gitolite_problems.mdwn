I am having some issues trying to make git-annex work with the latest version of Gitolite, 
When running git annex sync, or git annex copy --to I get.
"""
Failed to get annex.uuid configuration of repository origin

Instead, got: "annex.uuid=\ncore.gcrypt-id=\n"
"""

Has anyone found any solution to this? Also, I am using the latest version of Gitolite, because I wanted to see whether it would work.
Thanks, Zack.
EDIT: It might also be worthy to note that I did have a go at following the guide on this site.
