Well, the modes you show are wrong. Nothing in the annex should be writable. fsck needs to fix those. (It's true that it also always chmods even correct mode files/directories.. I've made a change avoiding that.)

I have not thought or tried shared git annex repos with multiple unix users writing to them. ([[tips/Using_gitolite_with_git-annex]] would be an alternative.) Seems to me that removing content from the annex would also be a problem, since the directory will need to be chmodded to allow deleting the content from it, and that will fail if it's owned by someone else.  Perhaps git-annex needs to honor core.sharedRepository and avoid these nice safeguards on file modes then.
