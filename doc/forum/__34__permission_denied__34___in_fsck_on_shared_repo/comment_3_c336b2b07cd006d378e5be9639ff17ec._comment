thanks, that's great. will there be a way to have sharedRepository work for shared remotes (rsync, directory) too, or is that better taken care of by acls?

@not thought of shared repos: we're having our family photo archive spread over our laptops, and backed up on our home storage server and on an rsync+encryption off-site server, with everyone naturally having their own accounts on all systems -- just if you need a use case.
