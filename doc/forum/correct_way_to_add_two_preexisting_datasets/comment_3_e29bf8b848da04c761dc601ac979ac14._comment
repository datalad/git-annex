Thanks. It is very clear now. I think I got it running. I have 2 direct mode copies in my ubuntu box and in the USB drive and one indirect in my ultrabook (small SSD).
What I meant is that even in direct mode, after sync ended, the set I indexed first ended with the contents of a folder in the .git dir using symlinks. But it might have been a leftover of previous attempts.
I think I got confused by the great amount of flexibility it provides.
Thanks.
