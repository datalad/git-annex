Well, it would be possible to add a configuration setting in the repository that tells the assistant what address:port to listen on.

But maybe it would be better to not use `assistant --autostart` in your situation? That command is basically the same as this shell script:

[[!format sh "
#!/bin/sh
for dir in $(cat $HOME/.config/git-annex/autostart); do
    cd $dir
    git annex webapp &
done
"]]

So you can write similar shell scripts that start the webapp with whatever options you like.
