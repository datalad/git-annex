Thanks Justin, but that wont work. Even pointing out a normal, non-bare repo and then adding it as a ssh remote will convert it into a bare repo. I confirmed that, and then I read this post:

    http://git-annex.branchable.com/forum/Local_and_remote_in_direct_mode/

that states that
> The \"Remote server using ssh\" option in the webapp is intended to set up a bare git repository on a server, not a non-bare git repository on a client.\"

I even tried to do 
    git remote add B ssh://machineB:/~/annex
but to no avail, the created annex on machine B becomes a bare repo.

The only way to do it for me was to do the following,
Assume my cellphone is device A, and my desktop is device B:

On machine B:

    cd ~/DCIM
    git init
    git annex init \"B\"
    git annex direct
    echo '*/5 * * * * * cd ~/DCIM; git annex sync' > crontab

On machine A:

    git clone ssh://user@machineB:/home/user/DCIM
    git annex sync
    git annex webapp

now pictures are synced to the computer in direct, non-bare format every 5 minutes. I have spent literally days on this and now I finally nailed it in a crude but working fashion.
