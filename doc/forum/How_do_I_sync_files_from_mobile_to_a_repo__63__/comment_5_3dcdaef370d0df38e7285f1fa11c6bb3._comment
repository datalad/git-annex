It occurs to me that another way you could have gotten confused is, if ssh://machineB:/~/annex was eg, created in the first place by running the git-annex webapp on machineB, then it would be a direct mode repo. In this case, yes core.bare=true, but so does annex.direct=true. And that repository will not be a bare repo really; it will contain the same file tree as you have on your mobile.
