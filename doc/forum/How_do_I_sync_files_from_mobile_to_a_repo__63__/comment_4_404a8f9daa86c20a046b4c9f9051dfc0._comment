I have double-checked, and when I already have an existing, non-bare repository, pointing the webapp at it over ssh keeps it as a non-bare repository. As I would expect.

> I even tried to do git remote add B ssh://machineB:/~/annex but to no avail, the created annex on machine B becomes a bare repo.

I didn't try this because it's such a violation of the way git actually works that I just can't believe it could happen. If it does, you've found the git bug of the year.

But, I think you just got confused about whether the repository existed before, or gave the wrong path to the existing repository which would result in a new, bare repository being created in the location you told it.

If you really think this happens, show a transcript with enough details for me, or the git developers, to reproduce the problem.
