I did this using a couple of tools (off the top of my head):

git annex find path/ --format '${key}\n' > /tmp/keyslist (outputs a list of keys)
find .git/annex/objects -type f | grep -wFf /tmp/keyslist > /tmp/filelist (outputs a list of files)

Then I use 'resync -avhP --files-from=/tmp/filelist . othermachine:some/tmp/dir' to transfer the files to the other machine.

Then I 'git annex import some/tmp/dir' to inject the content, then just delete the additional symlinks (and reset the index).

This speeds things up a bit. Even more speed can be had using tar/netcat.

Hope this points you in the right direction.
