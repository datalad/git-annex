Python on this system \"just works\". That's because Python is a project with a real community, so if one pundit said \"not supported\", dozen of people shrugged and typed \"make\", then packed up result for thousands to use.

But don't get carried away by OABI, that was just one random example how deployment of git-annex is problematic. There're bigger issues like community involvement, being able to investigate and resolve issues, submit patches, bring new working ideas, make git-annex development and lifecycle sustainable, in the end - as vividly cared by the author.
