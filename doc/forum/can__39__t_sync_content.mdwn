Hi,

I'm completely new to git-annex, I'm trying to follow this guide:

https://git-annex.branchable.com/tips/centralized_git_repository_tutorial/on_GitLab/

All steps succeeded except the `git annex sync --content` which results in the following message:

'Remote origin not usable by git-annex; setting annex-ignore'

Here is an example of the output I receive:

    $ git status
    On branch master
    Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.
    nothing to commit, working directory clean
    $
    $ git push origin master git-annex
    Everything up-to-date
    $
    $ git annex sync --content
    
      Remote origin not usable by git-annex; setting annex-ignore
    commit  ok
    pull origin
    ok
    pull origin
    ok
    $
    $ git config remote.origin.url
    https://user:pass@gitlab.com/user/repname.git

Is it required to use the ssh protocol in order to get annex working?

I'm using https since I'm behind a firewall, and the ssh protocol always time out. Is there anything I can do?
