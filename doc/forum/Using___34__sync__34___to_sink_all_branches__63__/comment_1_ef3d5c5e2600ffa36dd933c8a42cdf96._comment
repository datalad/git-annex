Ok, this is what I have come up with:

Merges can only be done on checked out branches. That's why the only way to do this without breaking the whole idea of git-annex (sync) is to check out each branch and run it separately. 

What would be the easiest way to do this? Considering possible unsaved changes in worktree and index?

Maybe simply using git-clone /tmp locally, which uses hardlinks for .git/objects/ which should make it perform ok?
