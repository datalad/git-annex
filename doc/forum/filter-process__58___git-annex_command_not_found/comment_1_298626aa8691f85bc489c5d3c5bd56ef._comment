This looks like the problem is happening in the remote repository,
and not in the local repisotry. (Which I think is the one whose config you
showed as the "outbound config").

It looks like a `git push` is being run to that remote. And then it seems
like git on that remote is trying to run `git-annex filter-process`.

That would not usually happen because pushing to a remote does not
update that remote's working tree. Which is what git must be doing when it
runs that command.

So, I think you likely have `receive.denyCurrentBranch` set to
`updateInstead` in the remote repository. That will make git update the
working tree. And having that configuration for the one repository would
explain why you only see the problem for that one.

As to why `git-annex` is not in PATH when git tries to run it there, that
probably comes down to how you have git-annex installed on that system. You
showed that an interactive shell does have `git-annex` in PATH when you ssh
in. But sometimes the shell configuration differs between interactive and
noninteractive shells. See [[tips/get_git-annex-shell_into_PATH]] (which is
about git-annex-shell, but also applies to git-annex).

BTW `realpath` is a unix command, and not one that git-annex uses. This is
probably something in a configuration file like ~/.bashrc that is run when
you ssh in to that host.
