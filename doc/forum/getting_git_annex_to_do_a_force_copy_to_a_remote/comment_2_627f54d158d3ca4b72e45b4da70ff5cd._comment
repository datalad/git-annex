Remote as in \"another physical machine\". I assumed that

    git annex copy --force --to REMOTE .

would have not trusted the contents in the current directory (or the remote that is being copied to) and then just go off and re-download/upload all the files and overwrite what is already there. I expected the combination of *--force* and copy *--to* that it would not bother to check if the files are there or not and just copy it regardless of the outcome.
