i basically exclude git-annex repositories from my backups now. i have a `numcopies` setting to a satisfactory number (say 2 or 3) that ensures that there are at least 2 copies of every file. then i send copies off to external drives, when they are full, i create a new repository on a new drive.

old versions are kept as long as you don't `dropunused`.
