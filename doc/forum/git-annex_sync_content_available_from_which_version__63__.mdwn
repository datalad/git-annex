Hi,

I'm on a centos 6.4 64bits & installed git-annex
version : git-annex-3.20120522-2.1.el6.x86_64

From my understanding of the help page, I should be able to sync content with :

git annex sync --content

but it is not recognized. The help tells me I may be able to use "get" but I'm unclear how...

Thanks for any help
