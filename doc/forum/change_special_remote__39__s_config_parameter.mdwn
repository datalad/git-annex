Hey there,

I have a couple of special remotes I use as storage. In one of them I had to
relocate the path of the directory. 

## Setup

It was first initalized with something along the lines

```sh
git annex initremote annexA type=rsync rsyncurl=host:/old/path encryption=none
```

Enabling it on other repositories worked without any additional
parameters, since all have access to same host names through ssh.

Some time later I tweaked the `/old/path` to `/new/path`. For an existing repo
I could handle this via changing the necessary value in `.git/config`.

## Problem

Much later I was setting up a new repository on a new host and I did

```sh
git annex enableremote annexA
```

Since I forgot the path tweak I did weeks ago, I couldn't give meaning to why
none of the files were getting found, and `fsck --from annexA` was failing. 

As soon as I remembered the path change I fixed the issue but I was curious if
I can somehow change the default url for this remote permanently for new repos.

## Attempts

I tried the following to no avail

```sh
$ git annex configremote annexA rsyncurl=host:/new/path
configremote annexA
git-annex: Cannot change field "rsyncurl" with this command. Use git-annex enableremote instead.
failed
configremote: 1 failed
```

And I can't see the `/old/path` in `git annex vicfg` to change.

Thanks in advance,  
C.
