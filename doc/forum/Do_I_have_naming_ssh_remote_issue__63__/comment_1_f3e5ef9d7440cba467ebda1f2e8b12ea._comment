You cannot use a UUID like that. How is git-anndx supposed to know where
that UUID is, or how to access it?

You do not use git-annex initremote with normal git remotes, only special
remotes.

Set up a git remote, and use `git-annex get --from` with that.

	git remote add ssh://someplace/path/to/repo

git-annex will then figure out that that git remote is the one with that
UUID, and be able to use it.

Names of git remotes are completely separate from **descriptions** of
git-annex repositories, which is what git-annex info displays.

AFAIK, all the documentation is clear about the several things that you
seem to have gotten confused about. Pointers to any places in
the documentation that are confusing about these matters are appreciated..
