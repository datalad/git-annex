I had the same problem, and I solved it using a host specific directory with symlink:

On host \"host1\", I've a directory named \"/home/me/host1/\" that contain a symlink \"mygitrepos\" to \"/home/me/mygitrepos/\".
On host \"host2\", I've a directory named \"/home/me/host2/\" that contain a symlink \"mygitrepos\" to \"/home/me/mygitrepos/\".

On the usb drive, the remote are set as:

    [remote \\"host1\\"]
        url = /home/me/host1/mygitrepos
        fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/host1/*
        annex-uuid = ce6175ba-4a0d-49e6-88b1-615dac7a37c1
    [remote \\"host2\\"]
        url = /home/me/host2/mygitrepos
        fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/host2/*
        annex-uuid = f7e3fbe8-f7f5-4231-a885-a72a46680d0b

(I didn't set the net remote, but it should work). With this added indirection I protect myself against git (and git-annex) confusion.
