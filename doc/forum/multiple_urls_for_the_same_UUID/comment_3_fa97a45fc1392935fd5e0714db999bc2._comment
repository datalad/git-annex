@Michael, like I said above, this use case is completely supported. That's why git-annex uses UUIDs to uniquely identify repositories, no matter where or how many urls are used for them. 

Just set up the remotes you need, and if they end up pointing to the same repository by different routes, git-annex will automatically notice.

---

The directory= parameter used when initializing a directory remote is only used to set up the remote in the .git/config file. It is not stored anywhere else, since the directory could be mounted at different locations on different computers, eg when a drive is moved between computers.
