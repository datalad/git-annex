The use case is like this: an external USB drive could be accessed both locally (as a special directory remote) or it could be mounted remotely (then it would need to be an rsync special remote).
Is there a way to handle this?

Failing that, can one switch the same remote from being a directory to an rsync without having to --move all of the content?

Finally, what's the best way to check directory remote's directory= parameter?
