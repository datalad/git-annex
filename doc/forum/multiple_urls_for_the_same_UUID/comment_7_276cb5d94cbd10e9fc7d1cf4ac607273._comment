You have two configured git remotes, host1 and host2, with the same
"url = /m/stuff". Only one of these remotes can be accessed at a time,
depending on where the drive is docked.

So, why not just combine those two remote configs
into a single remote. Call it "host".

git-annex will automatically notice when the uuid of the repository
pointed to by "host" changes, and it will update the .git/config
appropriately.

That BTW, happens to be just how I use git-annex with my own USB drive,
and it works great.

---

git annex sync will still try to sync with "host1-net" and "host2-net", as well
as which ever one of the two "host" points to. There's a small redundancy
there, but since it will sync with "host" first, as it knows local file
access is less expensive, the redundant sync will not involve much work.
