It's entirely expected and normal for git-annex to update the UUID
of a remote with `url = somepath` when it notices that the repo at 
`somepath` has changed.

This is what you want to happen. If git-annex didn't notice and react to
the UUID change, its location tracking information (for UUID A) would be
inconsistent with the actual status of the repo (using UUID B).
