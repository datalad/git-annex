Take a look at what git branch is checked out in your repository on the PC.
It might have, eg, an old version of the "master" branch checked out,
from before when the files were added.

Checking out the right branch will get you your files visible.

You might need to run `git annex sync` on the PC to pull in changes
from the laptop.
