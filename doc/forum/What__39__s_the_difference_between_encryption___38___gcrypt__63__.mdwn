Hi git-annexers,

The git-annex website has two articles on encryption: [https://git-annex.branchable.com/encryption/](https://git-annex.branchable.com/encryption/) and [https://git-annex.branchable.com/tips/fully_encrypted_git_repositories_with_gcrypt/](https://git-annex.branchable.com/tips/fully_encrypted_git_repositories_with_gcrypt/).

What is the difference between "vanilla" git-annex encryption and the workflow described in the "fully encrypted git repositories with gcrypt" guide?

I'm having a hard time figuring out whether one is more secure than the other. Or when I'd want to use one vs. the other.

Can anyone help shed some light?

Thank you.
