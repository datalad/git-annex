I wish that I had a good answer for you, but since you're using direct mode, I really do not!

You can run this to see the status:

    git -c core.bare=false status

That's safe. Everything below has a good chance of losing data if not used carefully.

You can run a command like this to *delete* an unwanted file (that is shown as a new file in the above).

    git -c core.bare=false rm -f unwanted_file

If the status shows a file as being modified, you can run this to throw away the modified version. This does not put back the old version! It will leave you with a broken symlink.

    git -c core.bare=false reset modified_file
    git -c core.bare=false checkout modified_file
    git annex fsck

If you're lucky, you can then `git annex get` to get the old version from some other repository that still has it.
