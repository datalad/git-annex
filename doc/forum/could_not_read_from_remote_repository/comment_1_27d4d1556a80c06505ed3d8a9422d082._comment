The problem seems to be on your desktop computer. /home/max/.ssh/git-annex-shell is a script that is created if you install git-annex from the standalone tarball (assuming you're using linux?). It seems that your desktop has that script, but you must have deleted that instalation of git-annex (perhaps you switched to installing it some other way), so the script doesn't work. As long as you have git-annex-shell in your PATH somehow, you can just remove /home/max/.ssh/git-annex-shell
