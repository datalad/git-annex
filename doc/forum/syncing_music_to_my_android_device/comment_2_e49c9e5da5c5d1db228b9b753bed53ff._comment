The new `git annex export` command can be used for this. It exports the
current tree of files to a special remote. If your Android device can be
mounted to the filesystem, you can initremote a directory special remote on
it, and then export to it.

It would also be possible to make a special remote that uses `adb` or some
other method to manipulate the files on the Android device, rather than
going via the directory special remote.

The main downside is, if you modify files on the Android device, or add new
files, there's no way to commit the changes from there back to
your git repository.
