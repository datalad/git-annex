I ended up writing a special remote for this, named [git-annex-remote-dumb](http://src.anarc.at/scripts.git/blob_plain/HEAD:/git-annex-remote-dumb) for lack of a better name. it mixes things up badly, is a abhorrent violation of protocol boundaries and is probably due to be taken to the back of the barn and shot, but it works for my case.

this would be better implemented as [[todo/dumb, unsafe, human-readable_backend]], but I suspect this cannot be directly implemented either without significant changes of the git-annex design, something which is unlikely to happen since [[todo/hide missing files]] is likely to be implemented with [[design/adjusted branches]].

more details about known problems, remaining tasks and limitations in the script header.
