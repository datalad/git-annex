so while `git rebase` can do magic, it will not work out of the box on direct mode repositories, unless you use `-c core.bare=false`, in which case you will totally shoot yourself in the foot because git will happily remove all those real files sitting in the checkout. you will need to `git annex indirect` before you do any of that magic. working on a clone of the git repo is also a good idea, if only for testing.

i personnally destroyed my whole music collection doing such a cleanup of the history. fortunately, i had a recent archived clone of the repo, so things weren't so bad.

but watch out for direct mode, as always.
