Hi,

Use case: I would like to have a "Public" top-level directory in my annex, which gets files in there published over HTTP on a particular server.

How I see doing this:

1. Put my annex to an http server with exported-over-http `/Public/` directory.
2. Configure a `post-update` hook with the following:

        $ git annex fix

3. Push files on `/Public/` to that annex.

Does it make sense? If yes, are there any gotchas I should beware of?

Thanks.
