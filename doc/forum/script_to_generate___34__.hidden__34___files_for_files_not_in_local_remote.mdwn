Hello,

I would like to know if someone made a script to generate ".hidden" files listinsg all files in a git annex repository which are not available in the local remote.

I'm not a prgrammer myself, but I will try to make this with a script greping in "git annex whereis" all files which are not available "[here]". But if somebody has a better idea or wants to try :-)

Best,
Hugo
