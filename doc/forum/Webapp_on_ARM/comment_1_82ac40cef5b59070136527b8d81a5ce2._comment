To build the WebApp on arm, you need a ghc that supports template haskell on arm. While I have heard persistent rumors of such a thing existing, I have yet to see it.

It's possible to build the WebApp on arm without that, but it's a complicated process, involving first building on x86 with the same versions of the haskell libraries that you have on the arm system, and then using the EvilSplicer to generate a source tree with the template haskell expanded, which can then be built on arm. This build process is not really suitable for a Debian package.
