Ok!  Got it working, and I can ssh between the two machines and access git-annex-shell on both sides, got all the $PATH stuff right.  I set up one repo on the desktop and one on the server, made them remotes of each other, and I have managed to transfer files back and forth using \"git annex sync.\"  But how do I get the assistant to do this automatically without command line intervention?  Just dropping the file in one folder, it doesn't show up in another, unlike the other git-annex repos I have between my two local computers.
