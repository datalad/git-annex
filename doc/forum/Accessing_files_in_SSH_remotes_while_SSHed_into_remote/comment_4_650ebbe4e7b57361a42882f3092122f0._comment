In your original message, you mentioned NFS won't work due to locking.
However, as far as I know, those NFS locking problems can be worked
around by `git config annex.pidlock true`. That said, I encourage
*not* using NFS if there is any alternative and it sounds like you've
found an alternative, so great.

Re your question about the assistant, have you tried running the assistant
in the repo on the server? Once it's running, it should update the
repository whenever the client pushes over a change.
