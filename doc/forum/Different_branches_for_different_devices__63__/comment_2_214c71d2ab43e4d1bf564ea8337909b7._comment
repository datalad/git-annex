Hi, thanks for your help.

But I don't get it entirely. Let's say I move photos from the phone folder into another folder (on the laptop, after merging, in the master branch). How do I propagate these changes back into the phone branch? Since, I guess, merging would only work one-way in this setting. Or let's say I want to push a new picture from my laptop into the phone branch, how would I do this?
