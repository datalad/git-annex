The [`unused` preferred content expression](https://git-annex.branchable.com/git-annex-preferred-content/) is probably what you're looking for.

As for your second problem, add your client repositories to a group aswell and make them only want `present`, `approxlackingcopies=1` or something along those lines. That will stop `sync --content` from trying to pull down everything.
