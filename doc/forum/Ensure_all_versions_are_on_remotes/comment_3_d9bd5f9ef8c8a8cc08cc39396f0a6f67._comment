hrm… as you can see in my post, I AM using “anything” as the wanted content. So I would expect all of the remotes (wasabi and machines) to get all of the file versions. But that’s not happening. It’s behaving more like “used” would.

I will try “anything or unused” despite the fact that it seems like “or unused” should be unnecessary.
