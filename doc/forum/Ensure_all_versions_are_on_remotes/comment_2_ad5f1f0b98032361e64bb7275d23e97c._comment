`sync --content` will certianly remove files from a repository when
the preferred content settings for that repository indicate it should
not contain that content.

When you use `sync --all`, a preferred content setting like
`"include=*"` or `"exclude=*"` will only ever match files in the current
working tree, not past versions of files. 

So, if the remote has such a preferred content expression, `sync --all
--content` will remove the past versions of files from it.

The way to avoid this behavior is to use a preferred content expression
that does not match on the filename. Eg, `"anything"`. Or don't set a
preferred content expression in the first place.
