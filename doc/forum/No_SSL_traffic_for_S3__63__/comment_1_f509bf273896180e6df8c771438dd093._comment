<http://hackage.haskell.org/package/hS3> is a Haskell library for S3, which git-annex uses. It does not support HTTPS. I'm sure its author would appreciate help, or maybe even just gentle motivation.

FWIW, I think that S3's authorization is designed to be pretty secure even over an un-encrypted transport.
It uses HMAC to sign the request with your AWS credentials securely, and includes a date that is hopefully used to avoid replay attacks.
