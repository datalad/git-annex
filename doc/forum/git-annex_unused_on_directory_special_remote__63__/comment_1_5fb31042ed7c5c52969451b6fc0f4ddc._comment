That file was created by a git-annex copy to the special remote that was
interrupted before it finished. It's safe to remove it.

`git-annex unused` can't detect these kinds of things on special remotes
(though it can in git-annex repositories). I do think it would be good if
it were able to. Opened [[todo/improve_unused_for_special_remotes]].
