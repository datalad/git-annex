When trying to setup an rsync.net repo I always get the following error:

Permission denied, please try again.
Permission denied, please try again.
Received disconnect from 114.xxx.xxx.xxx: 2: Too many authentication failures for 2*****

I can ssh into the account without any problems and couldn't find anything, which would have helped me any further.
Any ideas? Is the problem sitting in front of the computer? Is it a bug?

Thanks.
David

This is happening on Mavericks (10.9)
