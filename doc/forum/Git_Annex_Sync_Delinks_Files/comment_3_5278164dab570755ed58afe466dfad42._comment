\"Checking out files\" is a message printed by git (not by git-annex) when it is updating the work tree.

It still seems that you have somehow committed large files directly to git. Perhaps you accidentally ran \"git add\" on a large file.

git annex sync is probably merging this commit from one of your other repositories.
