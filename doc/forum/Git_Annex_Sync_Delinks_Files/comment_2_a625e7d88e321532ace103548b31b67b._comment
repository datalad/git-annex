I am not in direct mode.
I don't believe I did anything in the repo. I reset back to a commit and look in the folder and it's all symlinks and nothing in git status says anything about it.

Then I run `git annex sync` and one of the thing it does is \"Checking out files\" which takes a long time, since it seems to be copying the data into the working directory and commiting it.
I don't know why it's decided to do that.

What steps can I take to either get you more information or fix things?

Perhaps relatedly, if I make a mistake with git-annex, is git-reset master and git-reset synced/master the right approach?
Are there other things I should try, etc?
