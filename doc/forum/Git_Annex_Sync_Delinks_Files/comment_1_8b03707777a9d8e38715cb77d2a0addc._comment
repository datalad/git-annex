Are you using direct mode?

Before the direct mode guard was put in place, it was not uncommon for users to mistakenly run some command like \"git commit -a\" in a direct mode repository. This happily checks the full large files into git.

It sounds to me like you've done that. But, you have not provided enough information to make anything more than a vague guess.
