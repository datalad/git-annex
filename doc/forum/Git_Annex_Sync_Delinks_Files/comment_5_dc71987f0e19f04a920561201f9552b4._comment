Ok, so, looking into it a little more I think I've found that I screwed up updating a ref, so I didn't reset synced/master like I thought I did.

So, I don't know why it chose to make this choice in the first place, but I was able to reset and manually change my way around it.

That being said, I don't want to do this a lot, because I'm not fully clear on what the synced branches represent.
Is it that, on repo1, repo2/synced/master is the last thing that pushed over, and that after a sync local synced/master is always master, and before that it's the last sync to anywhere?

How safe is it to screw around with these things?
