The ` T ` in your `git show --raw` indicates that what was a symlink has been replaced with a regular file, and this has been committed to git. 

It's certainly possible to do that when using git-annex, but you have to go a bit out of your way to so shoot yourself in the foot, because normally the pre-commit hook will detect that, and fix up your commit to not change the type of the file. Something like this:

[[!format sh \"\"\"
joey@darkstar:~/tmp/r>git annex unlock foo
unlock foo (copying...) ok
joey@darkstar:~/tmp/r>git commit -a --no-verify -m oops
[master 9b63e4e] oops
 1 file changed, 1 deletion(-)
 rewrite foo (100%)
 mode change 120000 => 100644
joey@darkstar:~/tmp/r>git show --raw
commit 9b63e4efad1f229ae7713749e9ac2d0f9c286008

    oops

:120000 100644 ea46194... e69de29... T	foo
\"\"\"]]

The fact that you seem to have made 2 commits that did this, on the 21st and 30th, makes me wonder if your .git/hooks/pre-commit does not exist, or perhaps you are making some other mistake repeatedly.

The synced/* branches never have any data that is not stored somewhere else (another branch, possibly in the remote repository), so it should always be ok to delete them.
