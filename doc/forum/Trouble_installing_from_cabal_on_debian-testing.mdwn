I'm having trouble install from cabal on Debian-testing since the new beta released.

    % sudo aptitude remove --purge cabal-install
    % rm -rf $HOME/.cabal
    % sudo aptitude install cabal-install
    % cabal update
    % cabal install git-annex

The output all follows this general syntax:

    <package> depends on <anotherpackage> which failed to install

On the flip side, I upgrade my Debian to sid and it installed just fine through aptitude.

(Apologies for my English, and if this is simply a user error)
