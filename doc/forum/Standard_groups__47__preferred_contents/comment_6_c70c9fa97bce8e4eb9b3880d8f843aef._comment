Hi daniele,

I am not completely sure what you mean but I as far as I understand as soon as I set \"wanted\" to anything other than \"default\" the standard groups do not apply at all.
I can't use vicfg because I use windows and this command hangs ... probably because there is no vi.

However, I can still check the expressions:

    $ git annex group here
    manual
    $ git annex wanted here
    exclude=\"*\" and present
    $

Have you tried this? Does it work in your case?
Because the standard preferred contents also contains \"present\" so I assume it would behave the same.
Is maybe \"present\" broken or the behavior different than expected?
