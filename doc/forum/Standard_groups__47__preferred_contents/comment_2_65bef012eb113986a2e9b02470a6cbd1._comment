    Generally only the structure should be synced, no contents (i.e. \"manual\" is the closest)
    Currently it seems that when it changes remotely, it is \"dropped\" again so I need to manually use \"git annex get\" again

Maybe this could work? 

(in preferred content) exclude=\"*\" and present

So that what is present is preferred and not dropped, everything else is not downloaded unless the user explicitly asks to get it.
