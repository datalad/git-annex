> First, basic: Is the \"preferred content group\" an attribute of a repository or of a remote? E.g., when I use assistant, I can set this property for a remote repository. Will this property be synced to all other clients then or is it only valid for this particular client?

Yeah, it syncs the content group between the remotes, so you have to set it only in one repository and the information gets synced across the network.

> Second, I think the standard groups do still not cover what I want and I wonder if this could be done with preferred contents somehow? What I want:
> Generally only the structure should be synced, no contents (i.e. \"manual\" is the closest)

Well, I guess you have to manually create a git repo (but no annex repo!) on your remote. Once you add the remote the assistant should tell you that he can only sync the metadata, but no contents.
