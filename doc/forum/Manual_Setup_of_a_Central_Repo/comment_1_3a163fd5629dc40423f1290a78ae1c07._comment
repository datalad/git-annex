You could certainly do that. I don't think it's the easiest way.

Note that this is essentially a git question. It really has nothing to do with git-annex, unless you want to use the git-annex assistant, which can sync a repository over XMPP without needing a central git repository at all.

If I had this problem with git in general, I would make a new empty repository on the server, and push the local repository I have on the one machine to it. Then on the other machine, I would clone from the server. Problem solved, I think?
