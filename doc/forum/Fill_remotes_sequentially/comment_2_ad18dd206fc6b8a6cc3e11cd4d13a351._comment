I think this is the same system that there will be a talk about at
Distribits 2025? I have been looking forward to that talk.

@nobodyinperson seems on the right track with the `sequential=tape:1` idea.
And it seems fairly easy to implement using the same building blocks as
`sizebalanced`.

Relatedly, I wonder about sequential reading when a big `git-annex get`
is run. Do you have some solution for that in mind? I could imagine doing
something similar to Amazon Glacier, where the first get of a file fails,
but is queued for later retrival from tape, allowing multiple requests to
be ordered more efficiently.
