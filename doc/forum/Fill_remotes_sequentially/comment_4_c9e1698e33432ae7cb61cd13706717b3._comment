Another approach would be to configure `remote.<name>.annex-cost-command`
with a command that gives a low cost to the tape in the drive, and a high
cost to other tapes.

But git-annex only checks the cost once at startup. It would need to check
it again after each file. Which could be a new configuration setting. You
would need to make the cost command efficent enough that running it once per
file is not too slow.

With this approach, the standard archive group preferred content 
would probably suffice.
