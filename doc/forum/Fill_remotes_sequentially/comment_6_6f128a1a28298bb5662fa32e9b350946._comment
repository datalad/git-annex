> It seems like that the remote's cost could be a way to define the order in which the remotes are filled?

Yes because git-annex always tries to use the lowest cost remote first when
storing or retrieving a file. So using eg the standard archive group
preferred content setting, it would store a file on the lowest cost remote,
and then the other remotes would no longer want a copy of the file since it
was already stored to one.

`GETCOST` defines the default cost for a special remote. So rather than
configuring `remote.<name>.annex-cost-command`, your special remote could
check if the expected tape is currently in the drive, and return a lower cost.

If the cost needs to change while git-annex is running, due eg to a tape
being swapped, it could re-query `GETCOST` after every file. Which would
be less expensive than running a cost command. I think that a config
setting to make it do that is a feasible change to make to git-annex.

(Ignore `GETAVAILABILITY`, it's barely used and only by the assistant.)
