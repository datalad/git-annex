It sounds like *maybe* the new `sizebalanced=tape:1` expression could help here? ðŸ¤” But if I understand correctly, it would try to fill the tapes up equally, which is not what you want. There would need to be something like `sequential=tape:1`, which doesn't want to balance the annexes in terms of size, but just in order. But what order? ðŸ¤” Ordered by descending filled annex size? That would be what you need I think.
