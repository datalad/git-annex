Well, if you set `remote.foo.annex-readonly` to true, then git-annex
sync won't push changes to the remote named "foo".

You could set that in .git/config, or you could do something like
this to set it only when running the sync:

git -c remote.foo.annex-readonly=true annex sync

I am not sure about a good solution for sync-all-but-deletes.sh,
although it seems like the new `git annex proxy` could perhaps
be used to build it.

discard-all-my-changes.sh could probably be implemented using the new
`git annex proxy` command. It would be pretty unsafe though! Maybe
instead make it first commit all local changes, and then use 
`git annex proxy -- git reset --hard origin/master`
