Hi, 

Is there a preferred way to add files to git's index (instead of the annex) while in direct mode? 

I am trying to use git-annex for scientific data. On linux and mac in indirect mode, the git workflow is basically unchanged, and I really like the way git annex works. Unfortunately when I use git-annex on Windows, I have not found a good way to add things to git's tree. 

I've tried two things:

```
$ git annex proxy -- git add smallfile
```

This is slow because it has to copy things over to create a work tree

```
$ git config annex.largefiles="*.pdf or *.h5"
$ git annex add largefile.pdf
```

This doesn't seem to work as well as I'd like either. I'd like the equivalent of a ```git add``` command in direct mode.
