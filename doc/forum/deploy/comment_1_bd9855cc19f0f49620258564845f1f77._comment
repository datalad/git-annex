I'm not sure that a bare repository is the best way to go about it.

One way to do it is to have a non-bare repository, which gets updated when
you push (by eg setting receive.denyNonFastforwards=false), and have that
non-bare repository be the one you push to deploy to.

While you could push first to a bare repository and have it then push on
the the non-bare repository, that seems to mostly only complicate things,
since you will need to find a way to copy the annexed file contents from
the bare to the non-bare repository.
