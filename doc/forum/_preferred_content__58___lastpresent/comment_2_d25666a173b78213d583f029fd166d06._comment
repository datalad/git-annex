The aim is to be able to have some semi-automatic mode (using \"git-annex wanted . (lastpresent)\"), where file paths which you \"git-annex get\" one time always get updated to the latest version.

Or, you could also use some variant of it the other way round (using \"git-annex wanted . (notlastpresent)\"): all files would be present by default, but paths which you \"git-annex drop\"ed once wouldn't become present again.
