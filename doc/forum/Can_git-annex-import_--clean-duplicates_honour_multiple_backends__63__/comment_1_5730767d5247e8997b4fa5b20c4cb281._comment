When git-annex is adding a file, a backend can chose to not
generate any key, and then it will try the next backend in the list.

The only backend that does that is the URL backend.
So if someone lists URL first for some reason, it'll fall back to a backend
that is usable. It could just as well crash in that edge case; the
annex.backends UI happened before the needs of backends were perfectly
understood. (As did the "backend" name...)

Anyway, I see the use case, but.. `git annex import` actually honors
annex.backend settings in .gitattributes before annex.backends in
git-config. So, relying on it using the latter to make it check multiple
backends won't always work. I don't think it would be good to complicate
the .gitattributes annex.backends and --backend to support a list of
backends.

It seems it would be just as fast for you to run git-annex import once per
backend, rather than compliciating it to try multiple backends. 

I think that if annex.backends were not a list for historical reasons, 
I'd be suggesting a small shell script is your best option. 

And so rather than add a new feature just because annex.backends is
historically a list, I'd rather perhaps deprecate annex.backends as
unncessarily complicated, and make annex.backend be a single-backend
setting. (Just did that.)

Sorry this didn't quite go the way you wanted! If there is a disadvantage
to the simple shell script option, please do let me know..
