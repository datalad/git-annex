Hi, another installation issue on Ubuntu Lucid:

I started with a clean `~/.cabal` directory and did the following:

    andreas@antares:~$ sudo aptitude install cabal-install
    andreas@antares:~$ cabal update
    andreas@antares:~$ cabal install git-annex -v --bindir=$HOME/

However, I got some dpendancy error:

    cabal: dependencies conflict: base-3.0.3.2 requires syb ==0.1.0.2 however
    syb-0.1.0.2 was excluded because json-0.5 requires syb >=0.3.3

Any ideas?

Thanks for your help!
