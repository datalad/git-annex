Normally, files should be dropped from the transfer repository once they
have reached all known client repositories. The drop should be done by
the client repositories, so the transfer repo doesn't need access to the
client repos to verify that they have a copy.

But your problem is with *unused* files that are hanging around in
the transfer repo. This can happen if a file reaches the transfer repo and
then gets deleted from a client, and so the other clients never download it. 

To clean out those files, run: `git annex dropunused --from astarte --force`

You need to "use the force" because the unused file is only present in the
transfer repo. If you want to get rid of its content for good, that's fine.
A safer option is to move the unused file to the local repo: `git annex
move --unused --from astarte`
