Ok, I try to do 2) but it still fails:

```
dropunused 265 (from astarte...) (unsafe) 
  Could only verify the existence of 0 out of 1 necessary copies

  Rather than dropping this file, try using: git annex move

  (Use --force to override this check, or adjust numcopies.)
failed
```

all repositories are reachable directly.
