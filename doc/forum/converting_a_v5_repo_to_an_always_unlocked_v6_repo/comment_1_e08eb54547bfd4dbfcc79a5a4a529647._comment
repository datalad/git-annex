Thank you for trying v6 unlocked mode; do note that it's still somewhat
experimental.

`git annex info` doesn't report correctly on unlocked files, which is why
it has 0 in two places in the output you showed. I have just committed a
fix for that problem.

I don't know what would cause the unexpectedly small "local annex size".
That should correspond to `du -hsc .git/annex/objects`; if it does then you
seem to have fewer annexed objects than you expect for some reason.

The behavior on sync sounds kind of like git commit is checking the whole
contents of files into git, bypassing the annex. I don't know how that
could happen, barring a misconfiguration, but it's at least the first thing
to check. Check for gigabytes of data in .git/objects/ to see if that
is the case. 

If the above isn't the problem, can you see if the files in the work tree
have a link count of 2? For example:

	$ ls -l
	-rw-r--r--  2 joey joey     30 Mar 14 12:49 foo
	            ^

If you don't see link count of 2, something has caused the annex.thin not
to take effect. One possibility would be if the `git annex sync` merged in
changes that moved a lot of files around. When that happens, git checks out
the updated work tree, and git-annex currently is not able to preserve
annex.thin in that case.
