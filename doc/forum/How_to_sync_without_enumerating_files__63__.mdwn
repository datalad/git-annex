I regularly get this:

    It took 148.17 seconds to enumerate untracked files. 'status -uno'
    may speed it up, but you have to be careful not to forget to add
    new files yourself (see 'git help status').

How can I run git-annex sync without enumerating untracked files? Can I add the -uno switch somehow?
