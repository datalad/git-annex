I have a Git Annex repository on my laptop with currently 141094 files.

I used "git config annex.startupscan false" to disable the startup scan.

Yet the assistant still runs at high CPU consumption for extended periods of time after starting.

In the webapp, the startup scan is shown as completed, but under "Transfers" it says "Scanning for files to transfer".

What is the difference between "Performing startup scan" and "Scanning for files to transfer"?
