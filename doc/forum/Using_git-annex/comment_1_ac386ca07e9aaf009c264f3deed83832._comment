git does not allow pushing into a non-bare repsitory. This is why
bare repositories exist.

You have basically 3 choices:

1. Go to the first repo you made, and `git pull` from the other repo
   into it. Pulling in this direction will work.
2. Set up a bare repo that both the non-bare repos use.
3. Use `git annex sync`, which avoids this problem. You need to run
   it in both repos in order to get them to sync with one-another.
