git-annex certianly works with git over ssh. You seem to not have git-annex
installed on your git server, which will limit what you can do with it.

I cannot find the message "You appear to be using ssh to clone a git:// URL." 
in either git or git-annex's code base. Perhaps the message is coming from
something like gitosis or gitolite on your git server?

It's hard to give advice when you're not said anything about how you've set
things up.
