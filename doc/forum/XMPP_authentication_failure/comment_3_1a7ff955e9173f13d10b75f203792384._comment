John has gotten back to me with some analysis. The authentication failure is when SCRAM-SHA-1 is used. Ejabberd is rejecting the client's authentication request with a reason of \"bad-protocol\". It's not clear if ejabberd is broken or if gsasl is generating a bad SCRAM-SHA-1 authentication. We're inclined toward the latter, and will be forwarding this on to ejabberd.

The only way to turn off this authentication in ejabberd is to configure it to store passwords in plain text, or downgrade to a version older than 2.1.9, which first added it. Note that debian stable contains 2.1.5.3, so is not currently affected, for example.
