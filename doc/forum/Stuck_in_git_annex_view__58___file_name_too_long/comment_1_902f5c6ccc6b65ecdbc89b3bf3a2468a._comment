Hi,

Seem like I've managed to fix it by openning `.git/HEAD` file with VIM, and then changing:

```
ref: refs/heads/views/main(tag=_)
```

to this:

```
ref: refs/heads/main
```

Saved the file, then ran `git stash --all`. Which returned the repo to the original state.

Also before `git stash --all`, I ran `git restore .` `git annex fsck`, and `git add -A` but those didn't change anything.
