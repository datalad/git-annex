This can certainly happen if files in the repository are in a directory 
path that, when converted to a filename, is too long.

I tried reproducing it, and was basically able to get into the same state
as you. The reason both "git-annex vpop" and "git checkout master" fail
is that since the long files were staged in git, but unable to be written,
git considers them to be deleted. And so it refuses to do a checkout,
with "Your local changes to the following files would
be overwritten by checkout"

I was able to resolve it by deleting the directory that contained those
too long files. Which was empty anyway. That made git treat those files
as deleted, and allowed "git checkout master" to work, as well as
"git-annex vpop".

The reason "git-annex vpop" failed for you with "Not in a view" is that was
actually the second time you ran it, and the first time, despite the git
checkout failing, it had proceeded to update git-annex's state to say it had
popped out of the view. I've fixed that bug.

As to whether git-annex should try to detect this and avoid entering such a
view, I dunno..
