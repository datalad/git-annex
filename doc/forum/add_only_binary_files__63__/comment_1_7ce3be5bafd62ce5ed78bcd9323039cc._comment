If you can configure `annex.largefiles` to match only binary files, then `git annex add` will respect it, and only add those files.

For example, if you were working on a game written in C, and wanted to use git-annex only for the game art, but not the source code, you could configure it:

    git config annex.largefiles 'largerthan=100kb and not (include=*.c or include=*.h)'

This doesn't currently support looking at the file content to determine eg, its MIME type. That's been suggested as an added feature before.

More simply, if you `git add` the non-binary files yourself first, `git annex add` will skip over those files and only add the other files.
