You should set your repository to \"manual\" mode instead of \"client\" mode.

But then no data will be synced at all by the assistant, only metadata. You would have to do \"get/drop\" manually for commandline for all files.

Alternatively you could use the special \"archive\" folders that are supported by the assistant.
