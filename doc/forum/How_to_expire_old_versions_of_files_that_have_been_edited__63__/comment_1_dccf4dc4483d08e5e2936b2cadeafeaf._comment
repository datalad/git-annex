Sorry for commmenting on my own question ... I think I just figured out that `git annex unused` *does* in fact do what I want. When I tried it, it just didn't show the obsolete versions of the files I edited because I hadn't yet synchronized all repositories, so that was why the obsolete versions were still considered used.
