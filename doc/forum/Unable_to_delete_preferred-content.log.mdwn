I create a preferred content expression for a host by running `git annex wanted . <some expression>` for a test. Now I want to clear this completely. However, if I manually delete the `preferred-content.log`, every time I do a sync it pops back up.

How can I just delete this completely so it stays deleted? One of the reasons I want to clear this is since `git annex sync` behavior is changing to start doing `sync --content` by default.
