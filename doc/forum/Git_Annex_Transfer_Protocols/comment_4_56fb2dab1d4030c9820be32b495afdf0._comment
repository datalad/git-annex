Sorry if I am not clear. Actually i meant to ask, if i have 2 git repositories which are not special remotes and I am transferring annexed file content between these repositories using git annex command (move or copy) then, which protocol it uses to transfer content? Is it uses git-send-pack git-recieve-pack or some other protocols.
