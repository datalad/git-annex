I'm using the latest git-annex version available for arm64 on android already. I checked both the stable build and the autobuild, both point to the same archive with git-annex 10.20220121-g0bcb94487

I upgraded git to the latest revision available in termux base packages, namely git 2.37.1. It did not change anything.
