For those who face the same issue, here is a workaround: in git config, I force the annex.uuid and annex.version of the smudge & clean filter commands.

in .git/config, from this:

```
[filter \"annex\"]
  smudge = git-annex smudge -- %f
  clean = git-annex smudge --clean -- %f
```

I go to:

```
[filter \"annex\"]
  smudge = git -c annex.version=8 -c annex.uuid=<the repo uuid> annex smudge -- %f
  clean = git -c annex.version=8 -c annex.uuid=<the repo uuid> annex smudge --clean -- %f
```

You can get the repo uuid in the same file.

This is it !

I don't know though why the git-annex filter command is not able to read the .git/config file to retrieve this information by itself (?!).
