Aha, that is a useful clue about what's going on here!

Since those smudge commands are run by git, it may be that git is doing
something to the environment or cwd that prevents git-annex from reading
the git config.

Also, you have git installed in termux, but git-annex includes its
own copy of git in its distribution. So it may be that the termux git is
somehow causing this problem, but the one included in git-annex does not.

Can you try running: 

	cd git-annex.linux
	./runshell

And then see if the problem occurs when you use git-annex from within the
shell that starts?
