The _views_ functionality has made the file structure dynamic. 

With this in mind would it be possible/suitable to make drag and drop targets for `git-annex get` and `git-annex drop` commands?
This would make available git annex most interesting feature to assistant users.

I'm not entirely sure it's a good idea but it avoids file manager scripts and should be discoverable and easy to use.

I see two possibilities:

1. A folder in the annex root that contains a mirror of the tree but with only the unavailable files. Unavaliable files would then not be displayed in the live tree. Perhaps the folder can be called `remote`? Files can then be dragged from this tree to the live tree to trigger transfer of files. Any error/info gets displayed in the assistant
2. Flat droptargets in the annex root for `drop` and `get` commands.


Number one above makes discovering available files a bit cumbersome as you have to navigate down a parallell tree. It does make the available/remote distinction clearer which may be good for assistant users.

The mechanism could be extended to include a folder or droptarget for each remote.

The creation of droptargets/action folders could be triggered by a big visible button in the assistant interface **Manage Files**

Is it messy?
