Hi,
I want to download some files in git and git annex in Windows OS.
I have installed msysgit for git-scm in D:\Git directory,
Now I download git-annex assistant for Windows, and install it
in D:\Git\cmd directory.
But when I run the command "git annex" in git-bash, it says it can not
found the "git annex" command.
My question is that, how should I use git annex in Windows to download files?
For example, git annex get <filename>.
Doea anyone has any idear to help me figure it out?
Thanks in advance!
