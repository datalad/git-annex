When doing `git annex get fname` in a repo A with 2 remotes on LAN (B and C), it says they don't have git annex installed so it sets the `annex-ignore` flag. However, they do have it, and I can `annex-get` files from C to B. Versions of git and git-annex vary between the machines. Any idea what could be causing it? Perhaps A's git needs an update?


A:

* Ubuntu. 
* git 1.9.1
* git-annex 5.20140412ubuntu1

B: 

* Fedora 22
* git 2.3.2 (installed through Nix package manager, so its in a nonstandard path)
* git-annex 5.20140717 (installed normally, in /usr/bin)

C: 

* Fedora 22
* git 2.3.2 (installed through Nix package manager, so its in a nonstandard path)
* git-annex 5.20150219 (installed through Nix
