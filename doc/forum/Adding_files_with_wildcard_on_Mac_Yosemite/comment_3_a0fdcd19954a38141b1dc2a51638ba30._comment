The shell does not expand *.jpg to match files inside subdirectories.

I suggest you read up on how shell wildcards work, and how to use them
properly.

There is a bit of a bug here, which is that the shell, when `*.jpg` does not
expand to anything, passes the `"*.jpg"` parameter to git-annex un-expanded,
which then passes it off to git ls-files, which then unexpectedly expands
it to recursively match jpegs in subirectories. Only then does git-annex
try to add a `*.jpg` file, and when it doesn't exist, it exits with an
error, leaving the files it did add unstaged in git.

To get out of that situation, just re-run git-annex add and actually list
the files or directories to add, rather than a wildcard that won't expand
to them..

I'll see if I can fix the behavior here, it should just fail when given an
un-expanded wildcard.
