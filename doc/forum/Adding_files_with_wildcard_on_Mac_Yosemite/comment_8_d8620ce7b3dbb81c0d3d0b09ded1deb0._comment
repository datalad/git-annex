The old behavior was accidental, and was never documented. When you use
such undocumented behaviors, you're taking the risk of bugfixes breaking
things. It's not fair to call that a "regression". If I had to worry about
every bugfix breaking users who relied on the old buggy behavior in some
way, I could just stop working now.

It might be reasonable to add the "expand wildcards rather than letting the
shell do it" feature, as an option. Of course, it would need to be tested
for every git-annex command and problems like the one that caused this bug
to be noticed in the first place dealt with, for every git-annex command.
Using --include and --exclude, which already work seems pretty reasonable
instead.
