I've imported about half of my photos into an annex on an external HDD,
using metadata extensively for EXIF info, including place names.

Checking out a new view is slower than I expected, at ~6 minutes.
Is this expected behavior, am I pushing the limits of file count already?

Is there anything I can do to speed things up?

    % ls -1 | wc -l
        7050
    
    % git branch -vv
      git-annex                      4e590d4 update
    * master                         985ba54 add jen's phone backups
      views/Year=_;Month=_;Address=_ 795a58b refs/heads/views/Year=_;Month=_;Address=_
    
    % /usr/bin/time -p git annex view "Year=*" "Address=*" 
    view  (searching...)
    
    Checking out files: 100% (12789/12789), done.
    Switched to branch 'views/Year=_;Address=_'
    ok
    real       376.80
    user        17.98
    sys          9.66
