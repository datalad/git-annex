Yes, I think that [[todo/add_-all_option]] is the right approach for this. Seems unlikely you'd have some files' hashes handy without having them checked out, but operating on all content makes sense.

That page discusses some problems implementing it for some commands, but should not pose a problem for `move`. It would also be possible to support `get` and `copy`, except `--auto` couldn't be used with `--all`. Even `fsck` could support it.
