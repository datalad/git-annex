I had a similiar question in forum/new_microfeatures/. I would like to fetch/copy all the annexed content from a repo, be it on the current branch, another branch, or corresponds to an old version of a file. A command like \"git annex copy --all --from=source [path]\" would then ensure I have access to all the content I need even if I have later no longer access to source. Sure I could use rsync.
