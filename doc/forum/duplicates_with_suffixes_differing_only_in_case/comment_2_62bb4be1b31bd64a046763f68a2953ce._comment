Apologies again. I've realised that my count of the find command is totally wrong. It should be:

[[!format sh \"\"\"
$ find . -path .git -o \( \! -type d -print \) | wc -l
<actually larger number... which is worrying in its own right>\"
\"\"\"]]

The reason being... for some reason I have some files that contain the key, and some actual symbolic links, all intermixed.

Is there something I should do to make this all uniform?
