OK, please ignore. These scenarios account for only about 23 of the duplicates. There may still be, or have been, a problem.. maybe? Because I did add the same file in two different places,with the two case differing (but same) suffixes.

I am running another audit to work out why I have so many more files in the cloud than reachable in the annex. I suppose it's because I removed files previously, but I'm not sure.
