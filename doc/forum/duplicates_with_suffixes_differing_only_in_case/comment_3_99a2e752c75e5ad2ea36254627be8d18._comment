git-annex preserves the filename extension as-is, it does not try to
normalize it to lower case or anything. See discussion at
[[todo/Lower-case_extension_for_SHA256E_and_similar]].

You can configure git-annex to use SHA256 rather than the default SHA256E
so the extension is not used and it will deduplicate better. Eg, in
.gitattributes:

	* annex.backend=SHA256

You could then run `git-annex migrate` on existing files to switch them to
that backend. Bear in mind that you would have to re-upload the files to
your special remote, and would have to `git-annex dropunused --from`
that remote to clean up the duplicate data stored there.
