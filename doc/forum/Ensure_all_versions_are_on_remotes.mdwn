I thought I was getting the hang of annex, but have run into a bit of a problem. I could use some help ensuring that everything ends up in the right place.

Specifically, it seems like sync does a lot more than push and pull files - that it might actually try to drop things from remotes (at least with the -a) command.

I have two machines I work on, and two special remotes (S3/wasabi) that should have everything that's ever been annexed, including old versions of files.

If I `git annex sync -a -A` then it will pull all versions locally as well. So I think I may have to separate the get and copy commands? Though that gets a bit slower since it seems to enumerate every file for every version.

Here's what I'm doing so far:


```
git annex config --set annex.synccontent false   # sync -A still seems to send content, which I think is okay
git annex config --set annex.synconlyannex true
git annex config --set annex.autocommit false

git annex group wasabi-east wasabi
git annex group wasabi-west wasabi
git annex groupwanted wasabi anything
git annex required wasabi-east groupwanted
git annex required wasabi-west groupwanted

git annex group machine1 active
git annex group machine2 active
git annex groupwanted anything

# from machine1
git annex sync -a origin machine2 wasabi-east wasabi-west
git annex get -a
for remote in "wasabi-east wasabi-west"
do
  git annex copy -q -A -t $remote
done
```

I think that's what I need to do? I don't think I can use `git annex sync -a -A wasabi-east wasabi-west` because I don't want to pull old versions to my local machine.
