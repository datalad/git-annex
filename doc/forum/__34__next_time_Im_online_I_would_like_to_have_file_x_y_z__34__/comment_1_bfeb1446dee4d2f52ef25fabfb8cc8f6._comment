What I do for this is maintain a `todo` directory and `cp -a` + `git annex add` files I want to download into this directory.
the `cp -a` maintains the symlinks and `git annex add` fixes them if needed.

Also this works the same way if the situation is reversed and the machine you want to download the files onto is not online.  You can add files to the `todo` directory on the server, then once the client machine is online do a `git annex sync` + `git annex get todo`.
