Hi Joey, thanks for your tip and sorry for the delay in answering! I got stalled by other projects

Here is how the landscape looks like:
1) On the local machine:
git-annex version: 10.20220526-gc6b112108
2) On the remote machine:
git-annex version: 6.20180227

I will upgrade and let you know how it goes!
Thanks so much again!
