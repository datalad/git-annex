It seems that on the remote host there is something that sets
the `GIT_ANNEX_SHELL_LIMITED` environment variable.

That would not itself be enough to cause this problem normally.
So I suspect that the remote host also has a very old
version of git-annex installed on it. One that does not support
that `git-annex shell p2pstdio` command. So it applies that environment
variable when it would not normally apply.

The solution then is to upgrade the remote host's git-annex to version
6.20180228 or newer, which will support that command.
