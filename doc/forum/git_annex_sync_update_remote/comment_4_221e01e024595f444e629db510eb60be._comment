One way is to run this on your system:

	git-annex drop foo.h5 --from cluster

If you really have a reason to want to run `git-annex drop` on the cluster
itself, it needs to be able to connect back to your system in order to to
verify that your system still has a copy of the file it's dropping.

Imagine what would happen if you ran `git-annex drop` of the same file on
your system and on the cluster at the same time, if that check were not
done. The file would be dropped from both places and so you'd lose data.

You can use `git-annex drop --force` on the cluster if you're sure that
your system still has the content. But it's probably going to be better to
just use `git-annex drop --from cluster` run on your system, which avoids
the potential for a mistake causing data loss.
