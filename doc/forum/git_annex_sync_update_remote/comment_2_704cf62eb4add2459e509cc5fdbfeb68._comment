Thanks for the tip.

I wonder what the underlying reason is for needing a two-way remote. It would have been nice if for example

```
[my_system] $ git annex sync --force
```

would update the state of all available remotes. In that the only functionality that would not be available in the absence of a two-way remote is


```
[ssh->jed] $ git annex get myfile
```

But if one can live with that limitation it would simplify the setup and increase functionality. I do believe that it would also relax the `git-annex` dependency of the remote somewhat. Potentially, it would then only be needed at runtime on the remote. Not at runtime on the local system. That too would simplify the setup a lot (one can then use `git-annex` for a virtual environment that is not forced as the default base).
