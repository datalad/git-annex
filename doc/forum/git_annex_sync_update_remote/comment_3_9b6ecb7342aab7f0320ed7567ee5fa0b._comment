It does update the state of all available remotes of the `my_system` you're executing git-annex from. I would also love to see git-annex propagate the changes across the graph of connected remotes as far as it gets. It already has permissions to run git-annex on the remote server, so it could trigger a `git annex sync` from there, then reaching out for all configured remotes it has configured itself. But I'm sure @joey has a good reason not to do this, it screams of potential race conditions and git locking weirdness. But I don't know ðŸ¤·
