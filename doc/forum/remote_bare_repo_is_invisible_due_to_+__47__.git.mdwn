I'm having a major problem with one of my important annexes.

I'm mounting my "centralized" remote via sshfs. The remote is bare format.

I have tried removing it and adding it, making sure not to have a trailing / just in case. So:

git remote add mybare <pathto>/centralized-bare.git

But no matter what I do, I can't get annex to stop appending "/.git" to the path. So that I see something like this:

$ git annex info
fatal: not a git repository: '../../../../mnt/sshfs/centralized-bare.git/.git'

  First run: git-annex init
trusted repositories: 0

It's rendering it invisible and breaking using the centralized remote as that important fulcrum.

Any ideas?
