The external unit seems to hold a NTFS. Here is the `git-annex info` output:

However, `git status` says:

    fatal: This operation must be run in a work tree

Which is not the same message as \"no git found here\", but is also not what I expected to see. `git log` seems to work but says nothing about the file at hand.

On the PC side, however, I can see three commits on the file (I wish the commit message contained the command line with arguments, rather than the less descriptive \"git-annex in Toshiba USB HDD\").
Using `git show` and `git cat-file` I managed to determine the following:

March 4: the initial version of the file was committed.

May 17 11:51: the file's content changed to `../../../../../../../../../media/TOSHIBA EXT/annex/.git/annex/objects/kx/3W/SHA256E-s96418--c6164e17d88914b2e6781e2cb8e7b91e9669ddf2d9ee6f5cbb17f3212bccfba4.jpg/SHA256E-s96418--c6164e17d88914b2e6781e2cb8e7b91e9669ddf2d9ee6f5cbb17f3212bccfba4.jpg`.

May 17 12:22 the file's content changed again to `../../../../../../../../../media/TOSHIBA EXT/annex/.git/annex/objects/4z/gf/SHA256E-s245--ae647e7ad31089255413a9290ca9344542f3cd15ecef66884613bf776387633d.jpg/SHA256E-s245--ae647e7ad31089255413a9290ca9344542f3cd15ecef66884613bf776387633d.jpg`, i.e., a reference to the previous object. This is blob `../.git/annex/objects/ZQ/WF/SHA256E-s241--f3d7e5d1f788235b8eec0af58cc0c526b112b9e834a47ba7a475876c49dce343.jpg/SHA256E-s241--f3d7e5d1f788235b8eec0af58cc0c526b112b9e834a47ba7a475876c49dce343.jpg`.

What else can I do in order to work out what went wrong? Is having concurrent commands manipulating the same repository a bad idea?
