When I `git-annex drop --force` a file from my direct repository, it gets replaced by a symbolic-link-like file, containing a path.
Then, when I `git-annex sync` the repository to propagate the changes I have made, the file's content gets updated as if the file has been replaced.

My question is then: why does the original file gets replaced by the link-like file when I drop it?
