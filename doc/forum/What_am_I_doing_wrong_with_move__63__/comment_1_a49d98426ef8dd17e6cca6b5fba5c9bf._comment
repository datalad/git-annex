It sounds like the symlink in the git repository has been changed to point
to some other content that the content it had originally. Since git tracks
past versions of files, you should be able to use `git log` on the file to
find out when this hapened and you can use `git checkout` to check out the
original version of the file, or `git revert` the commit that changed it to
point to the wrong content. The content of the file should still be stored
in the git annex, so you should be able to access it this way.

Now, it kind of sounds like something added the git-annex link for a
file, as it would appear on the FAT filesytem, to git-annex as the new 
content of the file. It would certianly be a bug if a git-annex command
did that.

What does `git annex info` (with no other parameters) report when you run it in the repository on
the USB drive? What filesystem is in use on the USB drive?
