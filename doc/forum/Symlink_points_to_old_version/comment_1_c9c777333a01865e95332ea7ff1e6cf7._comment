The symlink should point to the new version, unless git-annex is catastropically
broken, and this can be easily demonstrated that git-annex is not catastropically
broken:

	joey@darkstar:~/tmp/demo>cat foo.pdf 
	original pdf
	joey@darkstar:~/tmp/demo>git annex edit foo.pdf
	unlock foo.pdf (copying...) ok
	joey@darkstar:~/tmp/demo>echo "added page" >> foo.pdf 
	joey@darkstar:~/tmp/demo>git annex add foo.pdf
	add foo.pdf ok
	(recording state in git...)
	joey@darkstar:~/tmp/demo>git commit -m foo
	[master 8d7f117] foo
	 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+), 1 deletion(-)
	joey@darkstar:~/tmp/demo>cat foo.pdf 
	original pdf
	added page

So, what's really going on for you to see what you see when you look at the
pdf? My guess is that your pdf editor/viewer is doing something bad/smart when
it encounters the symlink. Perhaps it's loading an old cached version of the
pdf rather than following the symlink or something.

When you use `git annex edit`, the file stops being a symlink, and
so whatever smart/bad behavior is causing the problem is avoided.

If this is the case, switching to direct mode would avoid the problem.
(`git annex direct`)

If I were using a program and verfied that it has such bad/smart behavior
on symlinks, I'd complain vigorously to its creators; it should't matter
if a program is asked to open a symlink or not, it should behave the same either way.
Unfortunately, it seems that some programs go out of their way to get
this wrong and all we can do about it is filed bugs and/or use direct mode.
