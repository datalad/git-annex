Thank you for the response. Sorry I didn't think of the possibility that the PDF reader could be the problem. I have done the same operation many times and never encountered this problem before though. The culprit is Apple's Preview.app. It now shows the new version and to my knowledge I haven't done anything in the meantime. Guess it is just time passed that has fixed \"the problem\".

Thank you!
