Thanks for your help. 
I've created a bare repo on one of the drives that didn't have a repo yet and have been moving the files to my laptops internal drive to add and commit and then back with `git annex move`, this seems to be working much better. (I already have more than half the files in the repo after one night, previously I had left it running for days and couldn't get that far. (And yes, the drives are very slow.))

re the filesystems, I thought so, but unfortunately these have to compatible with both mac and windoze...
