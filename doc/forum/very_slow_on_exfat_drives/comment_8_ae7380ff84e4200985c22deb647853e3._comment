To try out accessing the file from another location I created a second repo on my laptop.
So I have the \"real\" local repo (`L`), the repo on the disk (`D`) and another local repo for testing (`T`).
In `L` I added and committed `$FILE` and then moved it to `D`.
If I now run `git annex whereis $FILE` in all the repos
`L` tells me it's in `D`, while both `D` and `T` tell me the file isn't know to git. 
Only when I run `git annex sync` in `L` does `T` know and `D` still doesn't.

Not a big issue, just a little suprising, but it's fine to have to remember to run `sync` in the local repo before disconnecting the disk.

I have started looking into preferred content and groups and I will most likely use them. At least to begin with I want to try doing things manually and then later on move on to the more sophisticated tools.
