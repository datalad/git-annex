What might be happening on the exfat drive is, every time that filesystem
is mounted, it generates new inode numbers for all the files. So when you
run `git status`, git sees the new inode and needs to do work to determine
if it's changed. When the file is an annexed file that is unlocked (which
all annexed files necessarily are on this filesystem since it doesn't
support symlinks), git status needs to ask git-annex about it.
And git-annex has to either re-hash the file (for SHA) or do a
smaller amount of work (for WORM).

A bare repository does get around that. But what I tend to use in these
situations is a [[/special_remotes/directory]] special remote configured
with `ignoreinodes=yes`.
