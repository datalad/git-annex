I'm not sure exactly what you mean. If you `git annex move`d a file from a local repo to the bare repo on the HDD, your local repo should know about this immediately. I'm not sure if an immediate `git annex move` *on the HDD* afterwards knows about this. Sounds like it should but maybe it doesn't for performance reasons. That would explain the need for a subsequent `sync`. In general, I would recommend setting up preferred content expressions for each repo, and then always just run `git annex assist` to have it sync everything. Slower than manual moving and copying though, but less worrying.
