Hi joey,

if it was slow because the inodes changed it should only be slow the first time `git status` etc are run.
What I experienced was that it got slower the more files were in the repo whie the drive was continuously connected.


Thanks for your suggestion to use a directory special remote, but it's not clear to me how that would be an improvement over a bare repo.
The only drawback to using a bare repo is the lack of a working tree and special remotes don't seem to have that either.
