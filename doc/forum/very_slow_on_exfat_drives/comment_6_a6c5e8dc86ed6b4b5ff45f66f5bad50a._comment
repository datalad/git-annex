I'm not sure if this is caused by the disk's repo being bare, but after I have `git annex move`d a file there I still need to run `git annex sync` in the local source repo before I can find or copy the file to a third repo (in this case a second repo on my laptop).

This is a little confusing because it seems the bare repo on the disk doesn't know it has the files that have been moved to it.

Is this because it is bare, am I doing something wrong or why doesn't `git annex move` result in the target knowing that it has a given file?
