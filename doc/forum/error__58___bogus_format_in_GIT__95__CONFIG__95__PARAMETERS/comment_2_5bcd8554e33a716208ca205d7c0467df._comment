uff... ran into similar problem and since error is not really suggesting a reason for such odd behavior needed to search it up. In my case it was git-annex `10.20220624-1~ndall+1` which comes with `git` `2.30.2` and system-wide I have `2.35.1`.  Need to remember such a wisdom by heart unless may be the standalone build could somehow alert/complain into my face
