@yarik you're building git-annex standalone with the git from Debian stable
right? If you updated it to a newer git 2.34 from backports, 
you would not have this problem.

Of the standalone builds of git-annex that I made, I think only the
i386ancient one has an old enough git to have this problem.
And probably people using that one will not have a recent version of
git in the system and so won't be affected.
