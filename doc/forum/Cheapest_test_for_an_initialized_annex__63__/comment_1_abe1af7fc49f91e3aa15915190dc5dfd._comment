`git config annex.uuid` seems reliable enough to me - the uuid is stored in `.git/config` and doesn't exist if it's not annex-inited (assuming no malicious behavior).

If you're looking for the very cheapest, perhaps something like a file-exists check on `.git/annex` would work? I don't know if there are any edge cases with this one, though.
