The man page is not outdated, see
<https://git-annex.branchable.com/git-annex-import/>

It seem that `git help`'s handling of MANPATH makes it not look
first at the man pages from the standalone tarball in this case,
and instead it displays the system man page.

`git annex importfeed --help` will display the shorter documentation that's
built into the binary.
