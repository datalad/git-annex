Well, lock could check for modifications and require --force to lose them. But the check could be expensive for large files.

But `git annex lock` is just a convenient way to run `git checkout`. And running `git checkout` or `git reset --hard` will lose your uncommitted file the same way obviously. 

Perhaps the best fix would be to get rid of `lock` entirely, and let the user use the underlying git commands same as they would to drop modifications to other files. It would then also make sense to remove `unlock`, leaving only `edit`.
