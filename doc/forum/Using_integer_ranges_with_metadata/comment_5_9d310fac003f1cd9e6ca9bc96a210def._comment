It's a quick hack job, but has been working so far. I haven't played around with [[tips/automatically adding metadata]] yet. The filename based search does the right thing 99% of the time (at least for my file names), but I still always want to confirm that it is using the right movie data, so I'm running the script manually and keeping it interactive.
