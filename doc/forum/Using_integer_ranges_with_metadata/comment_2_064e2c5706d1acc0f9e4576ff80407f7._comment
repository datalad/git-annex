Perfect. It works great! Thanks.

Is this documented anywhere? I see it in the [release notes](https://git-annex.branchable.com/news/version_6.20160229/) now, but I didn't see anything mentioned in the metadata, metadata driven views or metadata design pages, or the git-annex-metadata man page. I'm not sure where I should look to see how else I can query the metadata.
