This is a great idea! So great that I got in the ol' time machine,
set the dial for February 29th 2016, and convinced past-me to implement it
then.

(For some reason, past-me decided to make the syntax `field>=number` and
`field<=number` instead of the syntax you suggested. He can be a bit of a
stick in the mud with his own outdated ideas that he holds onto tightly.)
