Which is why the assistant uses shared encryption by default..

You have set up a webdav repository using a gpg key that is on computer 1. To be able to access this repository on computer 2 you'll need to either copy the gpg private key from computer 1, or give computer 2 its own key and, on computer 1, add that key as one that can access the webdav repository.
