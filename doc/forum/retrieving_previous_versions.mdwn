Hi,

This might be a stupid question, but I did not find any information about it.
Can I retrieve previous versions of a file?
Let's say, I wanna do a "git annex get file", but considering a specific commit id. Is it possible? Are all the versions of the files kept inside .git/annex/objects?

Thanks!
