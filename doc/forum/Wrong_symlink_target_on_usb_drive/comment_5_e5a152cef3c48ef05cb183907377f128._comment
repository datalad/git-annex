Ok, I reproduced the problem. Normally core.symlinks will be false
by on NTFS. You have to manually set it to true to experience
this problem AFAICS.

I was able to lock a file (resulting in a broken symlink) and then successfully 
unlock it and the content was back in place.

git-annex always uses the lower case hash directory names when on a
crippled filesystem, since that's more portable and avoids lots of
potential problems. By configuring core.symlinks=true, you make git-annex
support locking files using symlinks, but these symlinks can't point to the
actual content location.

I think it makes sense for git-annex to use the the mixed case hash
directory names when core.symlinks=true even if the filesystem is crippled.
There's some foot-shooting potential, since some crippled fileystems
don't support the mixed-case hash directories. But, you have to manually
set up this configuration. I've made a change along these lines.
