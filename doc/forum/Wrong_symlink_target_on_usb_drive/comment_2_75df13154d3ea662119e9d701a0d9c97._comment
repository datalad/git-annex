OS is on both computers the same, on ext4.
The usb drive has 8GB and is NTFS formatted. About NTFS, I wasn't sure, so I left the partition as it was.

I built git-annex with `stack` three times on top of the latest tag, the version number differed in minor afaik (but can't remember the old ones).
I'm aware that I'm using an unstable version (forgot to mention it, sry about that), but it was on the two latest builds.
I also don't know where the information is what the stable release isâ€¦
