You might be able to unset annex.crippledfilesystem. Or it might cause some
stuff to break. Especially if you access this drive from Windows.

AFAIK symlinks don't work in Windows; at least git-annex does not know how
to create them on Windows. (Windows has symlink-ish things and git might be
able to use them.)

The link target is committed to the master branch, so you need to be able
to check out that same branch in other clones and have it point at the
content. So there can only be one link target used, and by default that's
the mixed case one. See [[tuning]] for how to change that.
