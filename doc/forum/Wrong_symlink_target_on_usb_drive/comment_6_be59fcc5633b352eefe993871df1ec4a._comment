Thanks for clearing it up, so I guess it was me.
Otherwise, I have some questions:

- Could I set `annex.crippledfilesystem` to `false` or is that dangerous on NTFS?
- Do symlinks also on Window work? (direction of the slash)
- Wouldn't it be better to modify the link target than the location of the objects?

I'm also fine with redirecting me to a FAQ, thanks again for your time and efforts.
