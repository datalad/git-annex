Gotcha! `core.symlinks` is `true`!
I set it to `false` and running `unlock` works fine, but after `lock` the file contents gets replaced with the two digits directories (not the three digits directories which are the place where the object is saved). Also, I can't unlock the file afterwards anymore.

However, I would be fine if symlinks work fine on other file system (as mentioned, would be great for saving space and have the access to the files) or other method.
