**EDIT: Mistakenly posted this thread in the forum.  I created a new post in [[todo|todo/Bittorrent-like_features]]

Do you think it would be possible to have bittorrent-like transfers between remotes, so that no one remote gets pegged too hard with transfers? It would be great if you distribute your files between multiple bandwidth-capped remotes, and want fast down speed.  Obviously, this isn't a simple task, but the protocol is already there, it just needs to be adapted for the purpose (and re-written in Haskell...).  Maybe some day in the future after the more important stuff gets taken care of?  It could be an enticing stretch goal.

PS: still working on getting BTC, will be donating soon!
