I'm trying to wrap my head around a similar situation.
I've tested this by git cloning my repo; the symlinks are copied, and end up broken because the annex directory under .git doesn't exist in the new repo.

So to be specific: can I conclude that when I use git to copy my repo, as long as I don't explicitly use git-annex in the process, I end up with a 'bare' git repo and I don't have to worry about my annexed files coming along?

Also: anyone know of anything that would be different about using git-svn? (i.e. git svn dcommit to push my changes to an svn repo)?
