I did try running fsck, which gave a message about not being able to find the file.

That's too bad that there are these types of bugs in direct mode. I find it really nice to be able to just throw all my stuff in the git annex and not worry about the state and have it synced everywhere.

Thanks again for making such a wonderful tool and helping me troubleshoot.
