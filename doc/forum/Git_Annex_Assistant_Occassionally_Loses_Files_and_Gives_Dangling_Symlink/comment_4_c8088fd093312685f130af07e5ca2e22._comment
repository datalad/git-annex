Something like SHA256E-s146706--ee3814f2a8c017d1a8c2af39124f107a8a663ed00a13757f6e328bd652ecba1b.txt in /.git/annex/objects/...

I didn't take very good notes, but it seemed to have the same filename as everything else. I was able to find it by doing an ag (grep) search for a string I knew was in the file.
