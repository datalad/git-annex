the problem with this is that you end up having two copies of the same files (the direct and indirect repositories). also, the switch to direct mode exploded (because i screwed up, granted)....

i have been thinking more and more than the webapp needs to have some sort of file manager as well, but that seems like a huge undertaking...

a better file manager integration could certainly allow to improve this experience. for me the requirements would be:

* \"clone this repo to\" - make a copy of this git annex repo to the specified target
* \"annex-copy those files to\" - the above + a file-transfer-like dialog that would track the total file transfer (as opposed to \"begin/end\" of single files, see also [[todo/do_not_bug_me_about_intermediate_files/]])
* probably some more stuff
