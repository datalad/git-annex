If I wanted to share files with someone, I'd set them up with a direct mode repository and link it to my (probably indirect mode) repository.

The question then becomes, how can this person decide which files to get if they don't want to or cannot get everything. I think that [[tips/File_manager_integration]] is a pretty good answer, although it does involve adding extensions to file managers. At least it involves adding something, rather than convincing a suprisingly large number of people that their ideas about symlinks are wrong. There are other possible answers, like building a file selection UI into the webapp..
