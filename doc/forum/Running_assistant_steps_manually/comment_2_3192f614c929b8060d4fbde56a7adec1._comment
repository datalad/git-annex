This looks great as I have:

 * A preference for multiple small repositories.
 * Old versions for `git-annex` due to being on Ubuntu LTS for my server.
 * A Samsung Galaxy Nexus which somehow seems too slow to run the assistant.

So these steps combined with some locking and maybe `inotify` seem perfect
