Yes, it can read id3-tags and guess titles from movie filenames but it sometimes gets confused by the filename metadata provided by the WORM-backend.

I think I have a good enough solution to this problem. It's not efficient when it comes to renames but handles adding and deletion just fine

    rsync -vaL --delete source dest

The -L flag looks at symbolic links and copies the actual data they are pointing to. Of course \"source\" must have all data locally for this to work.
