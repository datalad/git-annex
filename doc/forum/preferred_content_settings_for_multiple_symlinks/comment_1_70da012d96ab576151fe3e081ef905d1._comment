I find it's useful, when stuck on this kind of thing, to run `git annex find` at the command line passing it parts of the expression and making sure it works, and gradually building up to the complete expression.

You have to do some conversion due to differences between command line and preferred content expression format. For example `git annex find -\( --in here --and --include \"music/*\" -\)`
