I assume you mean that if I use direct mode locally, it will get things right.  I didn't think a special remote could ever be in direct mode.

Thank you for the info.  I don't want to lose the safeguards of indirect mode just for this, so I'll stick with my inelegant manual preferred content strings for now.
