Syncing seems to work only in one direction.

If I  go to machine B and:
 * change a file
 * select 'sync now' from the 'actions' menu for machine A
the webapp says it worked.

But if I login to machine A and inspect the file I expect to have changed, it is 'not available'.

If I run 'git annex get 'baz.txt' on machine A it complains and asks me to make available the reposiotry on machine B.
