Disabling a remote is a weak form of deleting it; the remote repository is
left as-is, but the git remote is removed so git-annex won't sync with it,
and the webapp won't show it.

I don't know if it makes sense for the webapp to expose this possibility.
It seems that it certianly doesn't makes sense to do it without getting
confirmation, since to re-enable the repository, the user has to do some
probably unknown to them process to set it back up.

In your case, I think that re-doing the pairing process would get them back
to how they were.

On consideration, I am going to remove this feature from the webapp UI.
