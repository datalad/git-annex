It depends, is it failing because the filenames checked into git are too
long? Or because the symlinks are links to too long paths?

In the former case, you can `git rename` files as you like.
As with any change you make to files in a git repository, that will
propigate to other git repositories in the usual ways.

In the latter case, you might be using a hash like SHA512 that causes
problimatically long paths, and then `git annex migrate --backend=SHA256` might
help.
