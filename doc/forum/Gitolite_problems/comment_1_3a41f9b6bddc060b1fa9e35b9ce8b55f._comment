I had that problem when I tried to access a newly created remote repository.
It seems git-annex doesn't recognize anymore if the remote repository has been initialized or not.
The workaround I used is create a local repository, initialize it with git annex, `clone --bare` it, add the bare repository as a remote and `git annex sync` it to initialize the bare repository. Then, you can put the bare repository where gitolite usualy keep its repositories and use it normally.
