Through no fault of Git Annex's, my drive lost power in the middle of a `git annex add`, and seems to have experienced corruption.

(If it matters, here's the log of what was happening when the drive powered off:)

```
# [...snip...]
add disk/DCIM/101_FUJI/DSCF3929.MOV
ok
add disk/DCIM/101_FUJI/DSCF3930.MOV

add disk/DCIM/101_FUJI/DSCF3931.MOV

failed
fatal: not a git repository: '../.git'
fatal: unable to access '../.git/config': Input/output error
git-annex: ../.git/annex: createDirectory: hardware fault (Input/output error)
```


Right after it happened, I tried to check on the data and got this error:

```
$ git annex fsck                                                    
fatal: /media/foo/bar/.git/annex/index: index file open failed: Structure needs cleaning                                                                                                   
git-annex: fd:13: hPutBuf: resource vanished (Broken pipe)
```

I fixed this (I hope) with an `fsck` of the drive (not a `git fsck` or `git annex fsck` - an actual `fsck` to repair the filesystem). Now I want to check that everything's okay with the data, and I run:

```
$ git annex fsck
git-annex: .git/annex/othertmp: createDirectory: already exists (File exists)
```

How can I get past this error?

Thanks!!
