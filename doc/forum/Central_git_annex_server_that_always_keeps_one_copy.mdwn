Is there a way to configure a central git repository that keeps track of large files with git annex so that multiple users can clone the repository but no repository clone can drop files from the server. Essentially, I'm looking for a way to have one repository that is always populated with at least one copy of each file. Other users shouldn't be able to tell that repository to drop any files (but would be able to add files it). The term "user" in that last sentence really refers to other clones...
