Did you have a look at

<https://git-annex.branchable.com/tips/Repositories_with_large_number_of_files/>?

What is your current object count (aka non-packed files)?:

    git count-objects

If you have many of them (multiple 10k) then it might be a good idea to repack them:

    git repack -ad
    git gc
