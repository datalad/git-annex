By "all annex blob files", do you mean that all the files it wants to
remove look like git-annex links?

The way this can generally happen is if you `git add` a file
(`git-annex add` would be the same) and then, without committing that, you 
`git rm` it, or you change the file and run `git add` again on the new
content. The original version of the file is not pointed to by any commit,
so it's unreachable.

So having a lot of such git objects is not itself evidence of a problem,
if you have done that a lot. Or something similar, such as deleting a
branch.
