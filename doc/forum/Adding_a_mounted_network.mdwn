I would like to add (bare) repositories on network directories that are locally mounted. "Add more repositories" gives me many choices, which apparently does not include this specifically. It does have "Removable drive" which sees the CIFS directory (perhaps because it's under /media?) but not the AFS directory, and there doesn't seem to be a way to enter a path where it's not inclined to look ("rescan for removable drives" still misses /afs). I am comfortable using shell commands, but I don't know what commands to use.
