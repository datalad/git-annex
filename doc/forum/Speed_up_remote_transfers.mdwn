I am currently trying to transfer git-annex managed files to my server.

I am getting them with `git annex /path`. However, these are very many small files, and git annex seems to take a tiny break in between them, so the process takes considerably longer than uploading a single file of the same size would.

Do you have any suggestions for improving my transfer speed in this case?
