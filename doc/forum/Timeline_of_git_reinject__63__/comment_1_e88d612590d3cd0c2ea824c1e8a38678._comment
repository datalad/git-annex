What turns out to have been going on here is the file was first checksummed
silently to get the key and see if it is --known, 
and then checksummed a second time (with the message displayed) as part of
the reinject process.

So, the second checksum is not needed in --known mode and I've made it not
be done.

It might be that the "(checksum)" message should be displayed during the
intial checksum of the file. git-annex used to always say when it
checksummed, but [[!commit 64160a96795d03ee791faa4757057200934687bc]] got
rid of that in most cases. I guess that "reinject bigfile <13 minute wait> ok"
is acceptable output though.
