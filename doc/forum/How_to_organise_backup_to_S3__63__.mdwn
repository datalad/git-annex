Hello,

what is the best way to use git-annex as a backup tool to S3? As far as I know, even if all data is copied to S3, I need a checkout of the git repo, correct? And of course the private key used.

- Is there a way to also save the repository data to S3? To have something like ```git annex restore-from-external-remote ...```

- If not, how do you organise the backup so that it is disaster proof? Upload the repo to some other external server regularly?

Thanks,
Florian
