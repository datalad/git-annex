I have around 70 GBs of data spread around 4 repositories on a Linux (Ubuntu) box. My problem is I need to reformat the drive they are on. I would like to move them to an external usb drive temporarily during reinstall then move them back to their original location. When I started with annex I did try to mv annexFolder/ toNewLoc/ which failed leaving behind a corrupt repo. What is a safe way to move an annex folder? My primary connection is a 3G modem so I am trying to avoid re downloading everything. Another thing I am trying to avoid is cloning the repos to the external drive, reinstall, clone it back to the internal drive and mark original and external repos as dead, but AFAIK those dead repos will show up in the output of whereis, so everytime I reformat I gonna have two extra dead repos.
