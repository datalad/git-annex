Thanks for the explanation, Joey.  I just posted a [comment](http://git-annex.branchable.com/bugs/Unnecessary_remote_transfers/#comment-f7110e694a9951d8ab546b8dec568bfa) about this on the bug report too.  Maybe the problem is simply that the Removable Drive option doesn't allow using internal, non-removable drives.

BTW, I don't know if this is relevant, but I only see one \"git-annex assistant\" process running.
