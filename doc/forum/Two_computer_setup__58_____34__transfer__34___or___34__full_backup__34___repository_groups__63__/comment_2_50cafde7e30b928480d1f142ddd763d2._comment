git-annex keeps track of the repository group on a per repository basis. That is, if the repository on Server-A is a full backup, both Client-A and Client-B will consider it to be one, and use it appropriately. You can't have just Client-A think it's a full backup; this setting will be automatically synced to Client-B.

Your setup sounds ok, although you might need to set up a XMPP account in order for Client-A and Client-B to immediately message one-another when they have new changes to sync. Otherwise, they might only poll Server-A occasionally for changes.
