It seems both Client-A and Client-B ARE actually syncing with this current setup. I think Client-B was just delayed due to the initial startup scan. So I guess at this point I am more or less asking if having both Client-A and Client-B have the remote repository being a \"full backup\" type is appropriate or if there is a better configuration that achieves what I am hoping to have.

Regards,
Blake
