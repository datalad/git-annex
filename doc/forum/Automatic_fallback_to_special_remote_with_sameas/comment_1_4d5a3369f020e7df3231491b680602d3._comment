Interesting idea. Even without --sameas, it's possible to have 2 remotes
that connect to the same repository in different ways, with one being
readonly and the other supporting write as well. So I don't think this is
really specific to --sameas.

git-annex also has limited knowledge about whether a given special remote
is readonly or not. That would make any kind of automated fallback unlikely
to work well.

I think there would need to be some config option to enable this.
Otherwise, the user might be surprised if git-annex used a remote that they
didn't want it to use for whatever reason.

I've opened a todo, [[todo/config_different_remote_to_use_for_write_operations]].
