I'm not entirely sure I understand the question, but think you're
probably trying to make nhost be able to access data0 independant
of whether the external HDD is plugged into nhost or zhost
(or perhaps qhost, whatever that is?)

The way to do that is simply to set up one remote for each place
the HDD can be plugged into. If the HDD can be plugged in locally,
make a remote pointing at the local mount point. If the HDD can be
plugged into zhost, make a remote pointing at
zhost:/run/media/mee/data0/NIdata/ and so on.

git-annex will figure out that these different remotes are pointing
at the same repository. When running `git annex get` or `git annex sync
--content`, it will check if the HDD is mounted locally,
and will use it there if so; if not it will fall back to trying
to access it via the remotes that use zhost etc.

So in summary, git-annex is designed to just work in this kind of scenario.
Set up lots of remotes and let it figure out which ones to use.
