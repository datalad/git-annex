Is there any way to list all of the existing tag and metadata field types? What I mean is, I have files tagged with several different tags, files with several metadata fields; is there any way to list all the tag and field names being used (not all the files WITH those tags)?

For example, something like:

git annex metadata --listfields
lastchanged
month
month-lastchanged
year
year-lastchanged

git annex metadata --listtags
Public
Personal
Work
