git-annex uses broken symlinks for files in the git repository whose
content is not currently present.

On filesystems not supporting symlinks, git represents them by putting the
symlink target in a regular file. This seems to be what you have here.

Your `find` command shows that the content is *not* located in
.git/annex/objects. It only found a .map file, not the content file.

So, `git annex get` seems like the most likely thing that will get the
content of these files from wherever it's stored.
