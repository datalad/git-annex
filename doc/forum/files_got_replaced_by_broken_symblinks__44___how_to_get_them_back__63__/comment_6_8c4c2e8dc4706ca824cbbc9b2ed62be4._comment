To sort of follow up on this after 3 months, ```git annex info``` displays ```repository mode: direct```

I have given up on git annex in the meantime, it is a nightmare to sync between different operating systems/file systems.
What might be \"wrong\" with my setup is that I have at least two machines that are dual-boot. So I'm using the same folder both in Windows and Linux. I also have an external HD with an annex repository that I plug in to different machines, and it apparently causes problems.
Now I have to write a python script to recover my lost files from the bottomless abyss that is the .git/annex folder.
