You get a regular git merge conflict, which can be resolved in any of the regular ways, except that conflicting files are just symlinks.

Example:

<pre>
$ git pull
...
Auto-merging myfile
CONFLICT (add/add): Merge conflict in myfile
Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.
$ git status
# On branch master
# Your branch and 'origin/master' have diverged,
# and have 1 and 1 different commit(s) each, respectively.
#
# Unmerged paths:
#   (use \"git add/rm <file>...\" as appropriate to mark resolution)
#
#	both added:         myfile
#
no changes added to commit (use \"git add\" and/or \"git commit -a\")
$ git add myfile
$ git commit -m \"took local version of the conflicting file\"
</pre>
