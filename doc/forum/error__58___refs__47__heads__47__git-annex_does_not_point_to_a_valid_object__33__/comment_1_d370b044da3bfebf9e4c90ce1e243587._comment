This means that a git commit's data has gotten lost somehow. You can verify that by trying

    git show 993859515190743e9bed7fc8e697d5ac4e2d03a0

The most common reason for this to happen is if the system is shutdown unexpectedly while git-annex is running. Or, if this repository is on a removable drive, if it got removed before the data could be written.

You can probably fix the problem by running:

    git annex repair
