It's possible to set up a http repo such that git-annex can use it, but
gitlab's http repos are not set up this way. It might be worth asking them
to do it. [[tips/setup_a_public_repository_on_a_web_site]] explains
one way to set up a http repo for git-annex.

But, even when git-annex is able to use a http repo, it can only
download files from it. There's no support for uploading git-annex managed
files to a remote http repo. This would need additional server-side support
of some kind.
