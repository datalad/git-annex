Simpler test case:

	joey@darkstar:~/src/git-annex>cd /tmp
	joey@darkstar:/tmp>mkdir foo
	joey@darkstar:/tmp>cd foo
	joey@darkstar:/tmp/foo>git --git-dir=`pwd`/.dotfiles --work-tree=`pwd` init
	Initialized empty Git repository in /tmp/foo/.dotfiles/
	joey@darkstar:/tmp/foo>git --git-dir=`pwd`/.dotfiles --work-tree=`pwd` annex init
	init  
	git-annex: Git refuses to operate in this repository,
	probably because it is owned by someone else.
	
	To add an exception for this directory, call:
		git config --global --add safe.directory /tmp/foo
	
	failed

Anything like this is clearly a bug.
And this forum is not the place to file bug reports. Doing so risks
it being forgotten about because who is going to go back and check old
forum threads to see if they were a bug that didn't get fixed?

Here, I opened a bug report: [[bugs/When_--git-dir_is_not_in_--work-tree]]
