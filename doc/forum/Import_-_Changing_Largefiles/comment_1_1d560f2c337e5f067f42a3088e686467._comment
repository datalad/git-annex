git-annex has to maintain a considerable amount of state about the content
of a special remote in order to efficiently import trees from it, and this
caching is what is preventing the new configuration of annex.largefiles
from being used.

In particular, git-annex knows the content identifier associated with the
file you imported before. And the key associated with that content
identifier is present in the repository. So it uses the existing content
rather than download it again.

While it would be possible to either remove enough information from the
git-annex branch to defeat that, or modify git-annex to have a mode where
it redoes expensive work, it seems to me to be easier to just treat this as
a case of an annexed file that you want to change to be stored in git
instead. Since that is a general problem, with a general solution. See
[[tips/largefiles]], "converting annexed to git".
