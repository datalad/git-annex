Nice!
So if I understand correctly, 'git reset -- file' was there to discard staged (but not commited) changes made to 'file', before checking out, so that it is equivalent to directly 'git checkout HEAD -- file' ?
I'm curious about the \"queueing machinery in git-annex\": does it end up calling the one git command with multiple files as arguments? does it correspond to the message \"(Recording state in git...)\" ?
Thanks!
