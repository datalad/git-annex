Sorry, didn't see you guys answered. 

I've tried the \"noatime\" mount option, but no change. 

I think joey might be on to something. As far as I understand [this github issue](https://github.com/rfjakob/gocryptfs/issues/606), there could be something to this.

I guess the only remaining solution would be something like Veracrypt. What a pity.

Thank you for your help.
