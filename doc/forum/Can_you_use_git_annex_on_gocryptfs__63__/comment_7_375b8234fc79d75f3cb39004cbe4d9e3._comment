This is a filesystem bug. I reported it here:
<https://github.com/rfjakob/gocryptfs/issues/724>

`git-annex add` makes a hard link to the file and then stats the hard link
before and after hashing. Due to this filesystem bug, it gets a different
size.

One workaround is:

	git config annex.crippledfilesystem true

Although setting annex.crippledfilesystem has other effects, including
git-annex not locking down permissions of annexed files. So I don't know if
I'd really recommend that workaround.

It would be possible for git-annex to work around this by statting the file
before making the hard link, rather than statting the hardlink after
creation. But I don't think I want to work around filesystem breakage like
that.
