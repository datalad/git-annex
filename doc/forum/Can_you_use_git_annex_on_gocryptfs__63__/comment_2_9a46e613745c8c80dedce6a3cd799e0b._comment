I wonder if gocryptfs does not have stable inode numbers?

The "changed while it was being added" message happens if git-annex saw one
inode number when it started adding the file, and a different one at the
end.

Changes to the mtime, device id, or file size will result in the same
message.

You might try running the `stat` command on a file before and after and
see what changed.
