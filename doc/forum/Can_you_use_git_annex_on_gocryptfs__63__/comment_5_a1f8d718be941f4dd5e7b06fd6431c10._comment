Some additional experiments:

```

From the above, I can see that `-ko noatime` doesn't do anything, but the ctime change is something unique to git-annex, not just from opening and reading file contents.  (I've used git-annex on filesystems without noatime before, so I didn't think noatime support was mandatory?)

But wait... why is the file 0444?

```
$ chmod 644 Invoice.pdf 
$ stat Invoice.pdf 
  File: Invoice.pdf
  Size: 54623           Blocks: 112        IO Block: 4096   regular file

OK, so setting it back to 0644 modifies ctime.

```
$ git annex add Invoice.pdf 
add Invoice.pdf 
                                  
  Invoice.pdf changed while it was being added
failed                            
add: 1 failed
$ stat Invoice.pdf 
  File: Invoice.pdf
  Size: 54623           Blocks: 112        IO Block: 4096   regular file
Device: bfh/191d        Inode: 294625      Links: 1
Access: (0444/-r--r--r--)  Uid: ( 1000/    dave)   Gid: ( 1000/    dave)

And running `git annex add` changes it back to 0444, *and* updates ctime.  So that's why that change is being observed.

So I don't think gocryptfs is doing anything unexpected w.r.t. modifying the file out from under git-annex.  Is there a way to get more detailed information about what git-annex thinks has changed?
