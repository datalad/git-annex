There's not a lot of places where git-annex could make this slower.
git-annex copy is just running rsync to the ssh server.

Have you tried benchmarking rsync of a large file to the server w/o
git-annex? rsync does do considerably more client-side work than does
scp, in order to support resuming, so that might be it.
