I think I'm having the same problem. See my comments on [[bugs/git annex sync deleted a bunch of files (not expected)]]

I've run `git annex sync` or `git annex webapp` on the laptop annex, then `git annex sync` on the external drive. I'm pretty sure some of the syncs have been interrupted. Does it help to see the .git/config from the external drive?

    [core]
    	repositoryformatversion = 0
    	filemode = true
    	bare = false
    	logallrefupdates = true
    [remote \"origin\"]
    	url = /home/edward/annex
    	fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*
    	annex-uuid = 38d109c9-7f5f-47cd-b15a-7b2beac22c64
    [branch \"master\"]
    	remote = origin
    	merge = refs/heads/master
    [annex]
    	uuid = 822dec0f-a0d3-42f6-b0dc-a47b6bf91944
    	version = 5
    [remote \"x230\"]
    	url = /home/edward/annex
    	fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/x230/*
    	annex-uuid = 38d109c9-7f5f-47cd-b15a-7b2beac22c64

Observations about my config, I have `bare = false`, which is correct. Do you think it is a problem that I have two remotes, `\"origin\"` and `\"x230\"` pointing at the same location?
