git sets bare = false in newly created non-bare repositories. Perhaps this is why? It seems likely that git has an inconsistent default if there's no configuration. Sounds worth filing a bug on git for. OTOH, messing with .git/config  in nonstandard ways seems like a good way to cause yourself random pain too.
