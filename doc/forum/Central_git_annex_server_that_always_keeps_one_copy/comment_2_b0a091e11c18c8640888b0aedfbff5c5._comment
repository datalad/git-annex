If you configure the central repository to be in the "full backup" group,
then the assistant and `git annex sync --content` etc will send the
contents of all files to it, and never remove the contents of files from
it.

This doesn't prevent someone manually running `git annex drop --from
$centralrepo --force`, or similar. But then, nothing prevents users from
using git to push annexed files to the central repo, and never sending the
contents of the files along to it.

It would be possible to make `git-annex-shell` have a config setting that
would prevent ever dropping keys. But I'd like to talk about this use case
more, to make sure that really makes sense.
