Oh, but it seems that `importfeed --force` already has code to handle this.
It checks if the file already exists and has the same url recorded as the url
being imported. For some reason in that case, it says it failed to import
the url, which seems a bit odd behavior to me, but in any case it doesn't
add a "2_" file.

That works for regular rss feeds, but does not work for yt-dlp urls.

The reason is the url mangling done for yt-dlp urls (and other special
remote urls). Fixed this bug.
