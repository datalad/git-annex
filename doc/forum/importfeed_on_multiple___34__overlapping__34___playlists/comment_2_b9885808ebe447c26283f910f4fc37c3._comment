The reason it doesn't overwrite is that it's not impossible for a feed
to have two posts with the same title (eg "happy groundhogs day") or
whatever else is used to construct the filename (unless you use `${itemid}`
in your --template).

Maybe overwriting would have been the right choice in your situation.. do
you think an option that overwrites would be useful?

Or maybe better, an option that skips downloading when a file with the
generated name already exists? If one groundhog's day greeting
is enough for you..
