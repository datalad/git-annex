I don't think overwrite here should have done anything -- should have been the same key and filename, so should be the same as skipping I think.

Overall indeed might be just nice to have `--existing noclob|overwrite|skip` so it either adds index to declob, or skips or overwrites?  I would have probably used either skip or overwrite ;)
