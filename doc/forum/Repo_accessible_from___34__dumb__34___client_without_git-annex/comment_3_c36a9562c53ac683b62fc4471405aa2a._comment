I take it all the above requires mounting an sshfs filsystem of the remote client to run the git-annex or the assistant \"locally\" on the desktop or laptop. Or am I missing something.

For the usb usecase a normal mount would suffice of course.

The lack of automation means running a rsync script from (or to) the phone is easier. Not as clever though :( and means running a separate \"system\" for distributing files to the phone.

Thanks again!
