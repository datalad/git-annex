Hello!

How can I have just a single directory unlocked at all times?

• I’m running the Assistant.

• If a new file is created in it, I’d like it to be added to annex BUT automatically unlocked (kept editable).

• If such an unlocked file is changed, I’d like the Assistant to sync the change.

How can this be configured?

Thank you!
