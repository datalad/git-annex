`git annex copy` will only push objects (content) into git annex private directory. You have to issue a `git annex merge` (or `git annex sync`) on the receiving end, or run `git annex assistant` there to update the working directory.

Note that you can run `git annex merge` as a post-update hook if you want this to be done automatically.
