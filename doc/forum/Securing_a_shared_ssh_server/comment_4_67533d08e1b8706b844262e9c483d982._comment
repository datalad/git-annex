Thanks, but my server is a synology nas and as you know from another thread of comments, having git-annex work on it is not that simple. ;-)
Moreover, I'd like to be able to use ssh accounts where I don't have a root access and not necessarily git. So, a general method to restrict ssh would interest me. 

But your answer seems to suggest that almost arbitrary rsync commands may be given. If so, I agree that there are few hopes to build a secured jail around this... But if really a limited subset of commands is used, I think it should be possible to check them securely. 

Now on I'm focused on having git-annex work because this looks like the most promising way. But I'll have another question regarding it: I noticed that we can restrict access to a specific repository using an appropriate environnement variable. But it's it possible to provide a list of repositories instead of just one? My collaborators will typically have access to several shares but not to all of them. 

Thanks for your responsiveness, after trying tens of candidates git-annex appears to be the only serious solution to replace Dropbox and I'm really glad that you actively help your users!
