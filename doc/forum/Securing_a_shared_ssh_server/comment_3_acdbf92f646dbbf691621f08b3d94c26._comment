I am confident that it will be *easier* to install git-annex-shell on your ssh server than it will be to lock down rsync. 

All you need to do is go get the standalone linux tarball of git-annex, untar it, and add its directory to PATH.

You can google for perl scripts that lock down rsync, but I have never been happy with any of the ones I found.
