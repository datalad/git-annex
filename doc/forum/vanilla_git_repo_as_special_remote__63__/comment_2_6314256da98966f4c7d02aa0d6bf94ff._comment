Right, though bup also requires installation on the server. I'm looking for a way to store content into a vanilla git repo (as I don't have permission to install anything custom on the server).

Since I want to store the content outside of git annex, it feels like a special remote. Though ideally it would have human readable files like:

* <https://git-annex.branchable.com/todo/dumb__44___unsafe__44___human-readable_backend/>

But since it's git and not just a normal (single version) filesystem, it could dedupe and save previous versions. Is there an easy way to hook git up safely to the external remote protocol:

* [[special_remotes/external]]
