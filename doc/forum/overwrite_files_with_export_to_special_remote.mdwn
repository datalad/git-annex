Hi,
I'd like to overwrite any conflicting files during an export to the directory special remote. 

I just exported ~30000 files but the export got interrupted half way. It resumed all right but 71 files seem to differ as git annex says it's "unsafe to overwrite" the files. 

Alternatively I'd be fine with getting neat output of the list of affected files somehow so that I can automate removal. 

I've looked through all the man pages I could find but there doesn't seem to be an obvious "overwrite" option.

I'd be thankful for any help.
