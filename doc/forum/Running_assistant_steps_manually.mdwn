Unfortunately one of the machines that I am running git-annex on is too old to handle the watcher thread.

The error message is:

    Watcher crashed: Need at least OSX 10.7.0 for file-level FSEvents


I am however interested in duplicating the assistant steps manually.  I'm happy to accept that I won't have the great, auto-magic, coverage, but, how I run the steps that the assistant runs?

I'm guessing there is a:

    git annex add .
    git commit -m "[blah]"
    git annex sync

but how do I get the pushing to backup/transfer/whatever remotes to work?  And what order should I do these?

What I would *like* to do is get a script that runs all of the needed annex steps and then kick it off in a cron job 2-5 times a day.

Any thoughts?
