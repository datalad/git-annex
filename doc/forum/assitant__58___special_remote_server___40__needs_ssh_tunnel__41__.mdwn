To connect to a remote server I have to tunnel it through a server I have access to. My .ssh/config for this connection looks like this:


    Host server-at-home
        HostName foo.bar.de
        User foo
        Port 222
        ProxyCommand /usr/bin/ssh me@server-i-have-access-to /bin/nc -w 3700 %h %p

Is it possible to create a connection using a similar configuration via the git-annex assistant?
