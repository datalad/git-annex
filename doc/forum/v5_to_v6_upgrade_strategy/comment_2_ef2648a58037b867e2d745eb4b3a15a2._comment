Many thanks for the reply. I did not add too much detail to my post as it was my first, and I was a bit shy.

I did do all of the steps indicated re v6. The binary has been fine for me also.

My question is a bit more complex as I am looking to apply v6 at some point to a set of distributed repos. Essentially it has the typical duplicated system topology: 2 remotes, several clients, each of which is linked to both remotes. Thus it will survive multiple failure scenarios.

I would be looking at the strategy of the order of repo upgrade. Say, a client first, and run a set of tests. And so on. Remotes last perhaps.

In any case I built a test bed as above and have been experimenting with a single client at a v6 repo.

So far it has been smooth, but right now I seem to be stuck where thinning is not having any effect: I still have a particular big file (1.5GB) in both the annex and the working dir. Lock remove the big file from the working dir, and leaves a link, and unlock restores the big file in the working dir. Yet, the annex still contains the big file no matter what. I was under the expectation that one of the big file copies would go away.
