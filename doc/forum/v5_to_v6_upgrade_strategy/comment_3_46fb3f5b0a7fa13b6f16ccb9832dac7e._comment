I'd encourage you to not upgrade any production repositories to v6 yet.
It's still in beta state and has known problems. Currently all known
problems are only innefficiencies, but there could also still be bugs.

When you do upgrade, you can upgrade your distibuted set of repos
peicemeal. v5 and v6 fully interoperate, until you start unlocking files in
the v6 clones of the repo. Once those unlocks get committed, the v5 clones
of the repo won't be able to access the unlocked file contents, and you'll
need to upgrade the clones then.

At some point in the future, I expect v6 mode to be done and then git-annex
will automatically upgrade for you. So the easist approach is to just wait
for that.

(Not addressing your problems with annex.thin here as you filed a separate
forum post and bug report about that.)
