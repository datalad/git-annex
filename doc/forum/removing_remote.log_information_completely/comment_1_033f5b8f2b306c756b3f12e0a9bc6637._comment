There's no guaranteed way to remove lines from log files on the git-annex
branch. A union merge can always result in a removed line being added back later.

The thing to do is to add a new line, that has a newer timestamp and
omits the information you want to remove with new information.

When reading the remote.log, git-annex will look for the line for a remote
that has the newest timestamp, and use it in preference to older lines.
