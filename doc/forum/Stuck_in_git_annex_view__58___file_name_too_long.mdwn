Hi,

I was experimenting with tags today, and seems like switching to a tag view broke my repository. Now, even `git status` gives me an error, output:

```
...vi.srt: File name too long
nothing to commit, working tree clean
On branch views/main(tag=_)
```

Before that I ran `git annex view tag=*`.

What I'm thinking is that before switching to a tag view file name/path was fine, but during switching seems like git annex transformed the file name which exceeds the max file path.

For ZFS those limits are:

```
getconf NAME_MAX /pool-name
255
getconf PATH_MAX /pool-name
4096
```

Steps to reproduce:

1. create a file in a directory with a long path
1. create a tag
2. switch to a tag

for example, here is one of the errors:

```
sizeï¹•huge/02_getting-a-handle-on-vectors_%knowledge-storages%courses%authorities%coursera%linear-algebra-machine-learning%01_introduction-to-linear-algebra-and-to-mathematics-for-machine-learning%02_the-relationship-between-machine-learning-linear-algebra-and-vectors-and%.pl.srt: File name too long
```

I've tried the following commands, but due to this error nothing changes:

1. `git annex vpop` < says "git-annex: Not in a view."
2. `git checkout main` < does nothing, stays "On branch views/main(tag=_)"
3. `git restore .` < does nothing, stays "On branch views/main(tag=_)"


Is there anything can be done to at least go back to the main branch and clear the error?
