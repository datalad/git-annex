When the git-annex webapp is used to add a ssh repository, it
installs a ssh key in `~/.ssh/authorized_keys`, which makes
ssh run `~/.ssh/git-annex-shell` if necessary.

This is not done for you if you set up a ssh remote using git at the
commend line. In that case, arranging for git-annex-shell to be in PATH
on the remote host somehow is left up to you.
