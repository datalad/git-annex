The assistant archival walk-through describes how files get removed from local repo if moved into archive repos.
What if the files in question aren't needed immediately (and can be archived) for one user of a shared repo, but needed by someone else on their own machine?
git-annex directory arrangement propagation wouldn't work for this case, it seems.  Could assistant handle this case?

It looks like having a browser of the directory tree in git-annex assistant webpage with say right-click menu with "get" and "drop" would be the most flexible.

Or maybe it could be more about integration with Linux etc file browsers (but then it's system specific, unlike with webapp).
