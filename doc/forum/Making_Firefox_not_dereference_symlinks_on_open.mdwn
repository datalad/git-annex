Firefox has the nasty habit that it will force-dereference symlinks when locally opening files (i. e., opening an annexed document will cause it to be opened in .git/annex/objects/…). Since this will break relative links within HTML files, this would make Firefox pretty useless when working with a git annex containing HTML files. (Apparently this behavior is [desired](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=803999) upstream and might not be fixed.)

Seems I’m not the only one who would like to work with annexed HTML files, though. On the [Debian bugtracker](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=691099), another user shared a handy shim which can be used in LD_PRELOAD and which will force Firefox to open symlinks in-place. Thought I’d share this here in case it’s of use to anyone.
