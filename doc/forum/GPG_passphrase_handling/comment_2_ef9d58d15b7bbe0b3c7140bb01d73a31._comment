I think I have found two ways I can make this happen.

1) If a filename contains UTF-8 it seems to happen (At least with this specific filename I have right here)

2) Finder.app does not seem to play nice with git-annex (I got the same error when I tried using Finder to copy files to my git-annex thing)
