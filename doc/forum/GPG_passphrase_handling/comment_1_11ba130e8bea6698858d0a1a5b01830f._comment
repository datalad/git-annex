In fact I just tried this with a key without a passphrase and I STILL get:

[2013-10-31 01:00:50 CET] Pusher: Syncing with rsync.net 
gpg: no valid addressees
gpg: [stdin]: encryption failed: no such user id

In addition I also noticed a lot of:
git-annex: fd:28: hPutBuf: resource vanished (Broken pipe)
