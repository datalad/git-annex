There seem to be a lot of different ways to install gpg on OSX, with different results in what works and not. I don't know what's going on with that. Advice from those who understand Mac OS would be appreciated.

As far as the \"gpg: no valid addressees\" bug goes, I can reproduce it on Linux, and have fixed it. Only affected using gcrypt with encryption=pubkey.

(Please file bug reports in [[bugs]] in the future, not in the forum!)
