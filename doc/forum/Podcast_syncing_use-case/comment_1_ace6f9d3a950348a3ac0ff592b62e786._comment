Right, --in goes by git-annex's [[location_tracking]] information; actually checking if a remote still has the files would make --in too expensive in many cases.

So you need to give `gpodder-on-usbdisk` current information. You can do that by going to `usb-ariaz` and doing a `git annex fsck`. That will find the deleted files and update the location information. Then, back on `gpodder-on-usbdisk`, `git pull usb-ariaz`, and then you can proceed with the commands you showed.
