Thanks for your tips, Claes.  I was really aware of `git repack` and that set of parameters.

I didn't mention, but sadly I'd run `git gc` on the repos just before collecting the above numbers.

I tried to repack two repositories -- `doc.annex` and `config.annex` -- using the values you suggested.   However, it did not have any measurable effect (less than 100mb in both cases).  

The number of unused files seem to be (much) less than 500 files in the repos.

BTW: All of the extra size is in the `.git/objects/` folder.  `.git/annex/` is quite small (always much less than 1GB).  Would that indicate that large files are checked in with git sans annex somehow?
