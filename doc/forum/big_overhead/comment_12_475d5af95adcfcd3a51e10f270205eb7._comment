Hi Joey,

Thanks for giving the thread a more appropriate title and thanks for the helpful messages. 

Let me start with the easy points:


* Looking at my log file of installed packages I have never used `etckeeper` on my system.  So unless it could have entered through `annex` then I think we can rule that one out. 
* According to `git log` the repos are from January 2014 where I restarted my repos. 


        commit 029a8e76ab5f66aa4390987130985550a1ccd69c
        Author: Rasmus <w530@domain.eu>
        Date:   Thu Jan 23 21:06:13 2014 +0100

        created repository


* When I start git repos I typically just use \"init\" so I don't think I did the 2012 commits. 
* I checked out one of the 74mb files.  When I do `file test.blob` it shows `test.blob: GPG symmetrically encrypted data (CAST5 cipher)`.  But none of my normal passwords worked.  Could such a gpg'ed file be from local network connections where the assistant asks for a passphrase?  I'm pretty sure that my transfer repo has only been using `gcrypt` and I believe I \"restarted\" my repos because I switched to `gcrypt` repos.  Also, my transfer repo is 10Gb as well which sounds big for transfer repo. 

I performed a similar \"analysis\" on the `conf.annex` repo which should contain mostly no binary files (some 16x16 pngs etc).  

`conf.annex` has 727 unreachable objects and 3477 commits in total.  Of these 338 are commits.  Here's an example of a larger commit message of an unreachable commit.

Across all commits 6006 objects are mentioned, but only 371 are unique. 

I checked out one blob and again `file` reports `GPG symmetrically encrypted data (CAST5 cipher)`.  Interesting for `conf.annex` I get this line when trying to decrypt

    gpg: DBG: cleared passphrase cached with ID: SBF83A0F822D0F664


For `doc.annex` I get

    gpg: DBG: cleared passphrase cached with ID: S32DEAD1E8DD06A4D

And on my other computer I see a third ID.  I'm not sure if this means anything when files are symmetrically encrypted, though.
