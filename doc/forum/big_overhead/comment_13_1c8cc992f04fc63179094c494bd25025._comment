These objects are the ones written by git-remote-gcrypt when pushing to a remote. That's why the weird dates, root pseudo-commit, crazy filenames, and big gpg encrypted blobs. All countermeasures that git-remote-gcrypt uses to keep your encrypted git remote safe and not leak information about what's in it.

So, this is a bug in git-remote-gcrypt. It needs to clean these objects up after pushing them! (Also after failed pushes.)
