I have a research project where I want to save some but not all versions. Those that should be saved are tagged. I want to create a repository (and archive it) that contains only those files. It is, so to say, the inverse of --unused.

I tried to clone a present repository to an new folder and move there only files that are referenced by some ref (branch or tag). 

But git annex does nothing:

```
git clone my-repo  repo-archive
cd repo-archive
git annex init
git annex copy --to=here --not --unused
```

However, git annex exits without copying any files, my repo is still empty afterwards.

I also tried git annex findkeys --not --unused, but it says invalid option --unused :-(

How can I do this?
