Hi,

I really like git-annex for sharing contents with all my devices. But i have a problem with the assistant on my phone, i don't know how to git annex get some file but not all.
For example i have this on a remote:

repository:
 - big file1
 - big file2
 - big file3

I have this repository on my phone. I would like to be able to checkout out only "big file2" directly within the assistant.
How can i achieve that?

Thank you.
