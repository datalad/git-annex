I just tried a git annex drop on a file in a direct mode repository, and that just did not change anything at all, as far as I can see. Actually I don't know what to expect, but doesn't that mean that I should have to switch to indirect mode in order to be able to drop large files to save space? 

Funny is that git annex drop did not complain at all but just reported \"ok\" after quite a while. And when I tried to drop a file that was not available in any other repository, it failed (which is expected behavior). So what is it what was \"ok\"?
