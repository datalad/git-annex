It's fine to delete .git/annex/transfer/ at any time.

Those files are used to make `git annex info` (and the webapp) be able to
show what transfers are in progress. Normally they're cleaned up when a
transfer finishes; if you interrupt git-annex they will be left behind.

Running `git annex info` is also supposed to clean up the stale transfer
info files, but it was broken -- now fixed.

The only time you get files in .git/annex/bad/ is when fsck finds a file
got corrupted somehow and moves its content there. It's fine to delete
those unless you were planning to recover or examine the corrupted file in
some way.
