This (quickly) finds only two entries: one regarding a file in `.git/annex/transfer` and one other in `.git/annex/bad/`.

Anyway, `git annex drop --unused` is too general and would potentially involve a number of other files.

I'm just considering something that should probably be safe:

    find .git/annex/transfer .git/annex/bad -type f -print0 | xargs -0 rm -fv

unless people tell me it's dangerous somehow.  Having to do a `git annex fsck` in the future is okay.  Having important features broken until I do a `git annex fsck` (or worse) is less cool. :-)
