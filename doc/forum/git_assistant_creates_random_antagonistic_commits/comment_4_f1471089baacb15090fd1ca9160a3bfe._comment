The assistant is seeing changes that are made in the process of populating
an annex pointer file with the file content on get, or replacing the file
content with the pointer file on drop.

For example, Annex/Content/PointerFile.hs in populatePointerFile
calls removeFile before replaceWorkTreeFile. I'm not sure why it needs to
do that, but since that's non-atomic, there's a window for the assistant
to see the file got deleted and commit the deletion, followed by committing
that it got added back.

In depopulatePointerFile, it's more clear why it does a non-atomic
replacement, since it calls secureErase on the file.

`git config annex.delayadd 1` will probably effectively avoid the problem.
