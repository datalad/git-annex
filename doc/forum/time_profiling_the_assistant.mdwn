From the repo (commit ecc548) I built git-annex with stack issuing this command:

    stack install --executable-profiling --library-profiling --ghc-options="-rtsopts -auto-all"

then I run the output executable with +RTS -p like

    git-annex version +RTS -p

and obtain the corresponding git-annex.prof with the time profile.

What I am unable to do is to get a time profile of the assistant: if I kill it the git-annex.prof file is empty, same happens if I stop the assistant with

    git-annex assistant --stop

So... is there another way to time-profile a git-annex command? Am I missing something in this procedure?

Any advice is welcome :)
