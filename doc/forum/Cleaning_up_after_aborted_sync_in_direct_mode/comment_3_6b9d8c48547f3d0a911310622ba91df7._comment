This sounds like one or more bugs that I should address, but I'm having trouble understanding exactly what you did, from your description, at the level of detail I need to replicate a problem.

Do you still have a copy of the corrupted repository? Or any error messages to show me?

It sounds like at least one problem might have been this bug: [[bugs/Unable_to_switch_back_to_direct_mode]]
At least that is fixed in current git.
