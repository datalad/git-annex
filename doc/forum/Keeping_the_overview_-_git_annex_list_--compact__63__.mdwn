Is there a way to obtain/keep the overview over a git annex repository with many directories and files?  For example to answer the following question in a compact way: which subdirectories of the current directory are complete locally?

The needed information is provided by both `git annex list` and `git annex info`, but the output of both command is very verbose and difficult to parse visually.

For example part of the output of `git annex list` could be:

```
XXX__ foo/bar/a
XXX__ foo/bar/b
XXX__ foo/bar/c
XXX__ foo/hey/d
XXX__ foo/hey/d
XXX__ foo/hey/e
```

Assuming that the `foo` directory contains no further files this could be compacted to

```
XXX__ foo/bar/
XXX__ foo/hey/
```

or even

```
XXX__ foo/
```

Of course the above procedure would only compact directories if all files have the same presence status.  But I guess that this will be true in many cases.

I’m thinking about implementing this as a filter to the output of `git annex list`, but wanted to check whether similar ideas haven’t been considered here before. (I could not find anything.)
