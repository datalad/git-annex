I did a change of one of the files and that totally broke all other repositories, git fsck reports a lot of missing trees (I'm not sure if it is normal), and git annex fsck started reporting invalid object for another file for some reason, also got a (git annex repair still reports everything is fine though.)

    fatal: git-write-tree: error building trees
    git-annex: failed to read sha from git write-tree



I tried following those instructions but I don't think I had a good repository, git annex repair reported everything was ok but git fsck said a lot of trees where missing and it stopped updating.
I noticed I was running different git version (git version 1.7.9.5 on the server and git version 1.8.4.2 on one of the clients), so maybe that was part of the reason.

I couldn't find out what remote dbb70cea-4b83-416f-93af-e59082c4d633 was supposed to be either, it wasn't any of the active ones and it didn't show up with git annex status either (I've lost a few repositories when I reinstalled my computer).

I ended up recreating the repository (by copying the raw files) from what I think is the most recent version from one of my computers and hope that it was a error that happened due to upgrades.
