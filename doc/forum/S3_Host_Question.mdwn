I have two machines A & B.  Each have their our repository.

On machine A I have created a remotehost (S3) and have synced successfully.

I am trying to link machine B to the same remote host.  I keep getting an error on the initremote command on machine B.

I tried using the same command as I did on A and it is not working.   Is there a different command to link machine B to an existing remote repository?

Any help is appreciated.

Rob
