Hi, just trying to set up git-annex-assistant on freshly installed windows 10. I've run the web app and created a local repo. I also grabbed the tarball on my server and ran "git-annex" with no arguments (?). I'm now trying to add remote server using ssh. I add the correct details and click "Check this server", at which point it displays "Testing Server, Checking ssh connection to the server. This could take a minute". indefinitely.

I've checked the log and don't see any ssh errors, but I do see some weirdness:

```

```

Not sure what that is but it might be relevant? Any help would be appreciated.
