Hello,

could someone please help me understand why old files are being pushed to `transfer`-type repository on `git annex sync --content`? The command is executed from a `client`-type repository. The goal is to have new photos downloaded from `transfer`, not the other way around.

With `--explain` I am seeing:

```
[ 20210428_164158.jpg matches preferred content: standard[TRUE] ]
copy 20210428_164158.jpg (to transfer_repository...) 
ok
```

`transfer_repository` is put into `transfer` group and wanted is set to `standard` hence it *should* not want the old files (there is a client repo that already has them).

Thanks, jose
