Symbolic links point to `......./.git/annex/objects/.....`

So, you can have them work by making your `.git/annex/objects` a link to the main repo's `.git/annex/objects`.

    cd $mylightweightclone/.git/annex
    mv objects objects.empty # move away but keep, just in case
    ln -s $centralrepository/.git/annex/objects

If the lightweight clone only performs read operations, I would expect things to work fine.

I don't know if it can be dangerous to the health of your central repository besides that, so be careful.
