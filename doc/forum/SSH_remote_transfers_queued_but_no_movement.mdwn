I created a local repository using the assistant, followed by setting up a remote ssh 'full backup' repository. While the assistant is running, changes in the local repository are detected and transfers are initiated, but they stay at 0%. How can I go about trouble-shooting this? I've made the remote annex directories 777 permissions for testing, but no change.

Thanks
