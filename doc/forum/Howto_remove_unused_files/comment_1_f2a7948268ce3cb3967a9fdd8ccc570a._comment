When i do 'git annex get .' on my usb-remote i get these kind of prints:

    get Archive/Maps/cities/diskcache/voices/slovenian_f/slovenian_female/g5ext_000 (not available) 
    No other repository is known to contain the file.
    failed


No repository contains the file? Well why cannot i then get it removed from the listing ..
