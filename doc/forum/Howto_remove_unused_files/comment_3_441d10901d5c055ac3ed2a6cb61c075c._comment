git-annex adds large file capabilities to git, but it leaves all the regular git commands there for you to use. So the answer to \"how do I do &lt;something I'd normally do with a git command&gt;\" is always \"run the git command\". You only need to use git-annex to add large files to git, and to move their content around between repositories. Hope that helps clear that up.
