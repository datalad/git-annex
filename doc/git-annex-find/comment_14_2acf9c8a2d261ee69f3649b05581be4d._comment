Ah, I hadn't considered the parallel to the standard `find` command, but now that you mention that I understand where you're coming from and can appreciate why `whereis` is free of this association.
Still, I would think that a user who, after looking at the docs for `git annex find`, specified `--all` because they wanted to operate on keys would not be surprised.

I notice that the man page for `git annex find` already has a \"SEE ALSO\" reference to `git annex whereis`. 
Could this be expanded so that it more clearly and prominently advises the reader who is looking to query against all known keys to check out the `--all` argument to `git annex whereis` as well as its `--format=` option if \"whereis\" information is not actually of interest?
