@Dan `findref` never supported listing all keys either.

Yours is the best argument I've seen so far for wanting `find --all`.
But the fact that this command is about listing files, not keys, still
makes that seem out of scope for it.

Using `whereis` would certainly do what you want. Another option would
be to `untrust` the repository that you are going to be deleting, and then
run `fsck --all`. Although that would report potentially other problems
besides files that are only present in that repository.

Finally, there's the bare metal option, which is also the fastest:
`find .git/annex/objects -type f`
