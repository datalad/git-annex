If you run `git annex copy --from slowremote1` in one terminal and at the
same time run `git annex copy --from slowremote2` in another terminal,
the two processes will cooperatively get the files, spreading the load 
amoung the remotes. This works because git-annex avoids downloading a file
if the same file is already being downloaded by a different process.
