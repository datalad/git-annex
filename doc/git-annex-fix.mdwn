# NAME

git-annex fix - fix up pointers to annexed content

# SYNOPSIS

git annex fix `[path ...]`

# DESCRIPTION

Fixes up symlinks that have become broken to again point to annexed
content. This is useful to run manually when you have been moving the
symlinks around, but is done automatically when committing a change
with git too.

Also, populates unlocked pointer files with annexed content. 
Usually this happens automatically, but some git commands can leave them 
unpopulated.

Also, adjusts unlocked files to be copies or hard links as
configured by annex.thin.

# OPTIONS

* file matching options
  
  The [[git-annex-matching-options]](1)

  the JSON instead.

* Also the [[git-annex-common-options]](1) can be used.
