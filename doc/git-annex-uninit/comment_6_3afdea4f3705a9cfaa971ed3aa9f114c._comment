Thank you for the illuminating comment!

> This is also what the error message says, btw.

    Not continuing with uninit; either delete or git annex add the file and retry.

You&rsquo;re right! I thought I only had a relative symlink pointing to the other symlink and not pointing into .git/annex/objects. It turns out that this is true for most of my symlinks but, just like you pointed out, some of them were pointing into .git/annex and the right thing to do there is to `add` them.

Also, thank you for pointing me towards todo/bugs/forum!
