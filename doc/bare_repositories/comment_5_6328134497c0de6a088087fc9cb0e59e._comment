Well, no, i don't think they changed, unless i missed something: there
shouldn't be a `.git` repository there.

There are [various
instructions](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10637378/how-do-i-convert-a-bare-git-repository-into-a-normal-one-in-place)
on how to do this online. They do seem to agree with the first comment
above.

Personnally, I would just `git clone` to a different repo and `git
annex forget` the old one. Unless you have a very complex repository
with a lot of files, this is simple enough... You could even use `git
annex reinit` to recycle the previous uuid if that's a concern. So in
short:

   git clone repo.git repo
   cd repo
   git annex info --fast # find the UUID of repo.git
   git annex move --from $UUID
   git annex reinit $UUID

Then `repo.git` can be removed if you are certain everything is
correct in `repo`.

Note that you may want to have backups of everything before you do
anything, as usual.
