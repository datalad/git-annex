These instructions don't work for me, unfortunately.

This step:

    git push origin master git-annex

results in:

    To ssh://my.server.com/home/itz/git/annex.git
     ! [rejected]        git-annex -> git-annex (non-fast-forward)
    error: failed to push some refs to 'ssh://my.server.com/home/itz/git/annex.git'
    hint: Updates were rejected because a pushed branch tip is behind its remote
    hint: counterpart. Check out this branch and integrate the remote changes
    hint: (e.g. 'git pull ...') before pushing again.
    hint: See the 'Note about fast-forwards' in 'git push --help' for details.

Versions: git 1:1.9.1-1~bpo70+2 , git-annex 5.20141024~bpo70+1 (both packaged by Debian, same on local and remote)

And yes, I did a pull on the master branch first.  Afraid to do anything
with the git-annex branch without explicit instruction.
