# NAME

git-annex renameremote - changes name of a special remote

# SYNOPSIS

git annex renameremote `name|uuid|desc newname`

# DESCRIPTION

Changes the name that is used to enable a special remote.

Normally the current name is used to identify the special remote to rename, 
but its uuid or description can also be used.

This is especially useful when an old special remote used a name, and now you
want to use that name for a new special remote. `git annex initremote`
won't let you create a remote with a conflicting name, so rename the old
remote first.

	git annex renameremote phone lost-phone
	git annex initremote phone ...

This only updates the name that git-annex has stored for use 
by `git annex enableremote`. It does not update the git config stanza
for the special remote to use the new name, but of course you can edit
the git config if you want to rename it there.
