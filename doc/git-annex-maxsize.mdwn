# NAME

git-annex maxsize - configure maximum size of a repository

# SYNOPSIS

git annex maxsize repository size

git annex maxsize here --auto

git annex maxsize repository

# DESCRIPTION

This configures the maximum combined size of annexed files that can be
stored in a repository. When run without a size or the --auto option,
it displays the currently configured maxsize.

The repository can be specified by git remote name or
by uuid. For the current repository, use "here".

The size can be specified using any units. For example "100 gigabytes" or
"0.8 TB"

This is advisory only, it does not prevent git-annex from trying to store
more data than that in a repository. So use this to tell git-annex about
hard repository size limits that are enforced in some other way.

For example, if a git repository is on a 1 terabyte drive, and is the only
thing stored on that drive, and `annex.diskreserve` is configured to 1
gigabyte, then it would make sense to run 
`git-annex maxsize here "999 gigabytes"`.
