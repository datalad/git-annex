# NAME

git-remote-annex - remote helper program to store a git repository in a git-annex special remote

# SYNOPSIS

git fetch annex::uuid?param=value&param=value...

# DESCRIPTION

This is a git remote helper program that allows git to clone,
pull and push from a git repository that is stored in a git-annex
special remote.

The format of the remote URL is "annex::" followed by the UUID of the
special remote, and then followed by all of the configuration parameters of
the special remote.

For example, to clone from a directory special remote:

    git clone annex::358ff77e-0bc3-11ef-bc49-872e6695c0e3?type=directory&encryption=none&directory=/mnt/foo/

When configuring the url of an existing special remote, a
shorter url of "annex::" is sufficient. For example:

    git-annex initremote foo type=directory encryption=none directory=/mnt/foo
    git config remote.foo.url annex::
	git push foo master

Configuring the url like that is automatically done when cloning from a
special remote, but not by [[git-annex-initremote]](1) and
[[git-annex-enableremote]](1).

When a special remote needs some additional credentials to be provided,
they are not included in the URL, and need to be provided when cloning from
the special remote. That is typically done by setting environment
variables. Some special remotes may also need environment variables to be
set when pulling or pushing.

The git repository is stored in the special remote using special annex objects
with names starting with "GITMANIFEST" and "GITBUNDLE". For details about
how the git repository is stored, see
<https://git-annex.branchable.com/internals/git-remote-annex/>

Pushes to a special remote are usually done incrementally. However,
sometimes the whole git repository (but not the annex) needs to be
re-uploaded. That is done when force pushing a ref, or deleting a
ref from the remote.

The special remote accumulates one GITBUNDLE object per push, and old
objects are usually not deleted. This means that refs pushed to the special
remote can still be accessed even after deleting or overwriting them.
A push that deletes every ref from the special remote does delete all
the accumulated GITBUNDLE objects. But of course, making such a push
means that someone clones from the special remote at that point in time
will see an empty remote.

Like any git repository, a git repository stored on a special remote can
have conflicting things pushed to it from different places. This mostly
works the same as any other git repository, eg a push that overwrites other
work will be prevented unless forced. However, it is possible, when
conflicting pushes are being done at the same time, for one of the pushes
to be overwritten by the other one. In this situation, the push will appear
to have succeeded, but pulling later will show the true situation.
