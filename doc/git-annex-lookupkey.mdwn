# NAME

git-annex lookupkey - looks up key used for file

# SYNOPSIS

git annex lookupkey `[file ...]`

# DESCRIPTION

This plumbing-level command looks up the key used for a file in the
index. The key is output to stdout. If there is no key (because
the file is not present in the index, or is not a git-annex managed file),
nothing is output, and it exits nonzero.

# OPTIONS

* `--ref`

  Rather than looking for the specified files in the index, interpet them
  as git refs. For example to find the key used for somefile in tag v1.0:

    git-annex lookupkey v1.0:somefile

* `--batch`

  Enable batch mode, in which a line containing the filename is read from
  stdin, the key is output to stdout (with a trailing newline), and repeat.

  Note that if there is no key corresponding to the file, an empty line is
  output to stdout instead.

* `-z`

  Makes the `--batch` input be delimited by nulls instead of the usual
  newlines.

* Also the [[git-annex-common-options]](1) can be used.
