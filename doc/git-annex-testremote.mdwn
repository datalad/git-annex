# NAME

git-annex testremote - test transfers to/from a remote

# SYNOPSIS

git annex testremote `remote`

# DESCRIPTION

This tests a remote by generating some random objects and sending them to
the remote, then redownloading them, removing them from the remote, etc.

It's safe to run in an existing repository (the repository contents are
not altered), although it may perform expensive data transfers.

It's best to make a new remote for testing purposes. While the test
tries to clean up after itself, if the remote being tested had a bug,
the cleanup might fail, leaving test data in the remote.

Testing will use the remote's configuration, automatically varying
the chunk sizes, and with simple shared encryption enabled and disabled.

# OPTIONS

* `--fast`

  Perform a smaller set of tests.

* `--size=NUnits`

  Tune the base size of the generated objects. The default is 1MiB.
