git-annex now does Windows!

* First, [install Git for Windows](http://git-scm.com/downloads)

* Then, install git-annex:

  - Windows 10 [download](https://downloads.kitenet.net/git-annex/windows/current/)

This port is now in reasonably good shape for command-line use of
git-annex. The assistant and webapp are also usable. There are some known
problems and parts that don't work. See [[todo/windows_support]] for
current status.

## autobuilds

An autobuild is also available, thanks to the Datalad project.

* Windows 10 [download](https://downloads.kitenet.net/git-annex/autobuild/windows/git-annex-installer.exe)
  ([build logs](https://github.com/datalad/git-annex/actions?query=workflow%3A%22Build+git-annex+on+Windows%22))

## building it yourself

To build git-annex from source on Windows, you need to install
[Git for Windows](http://git-scm.com/downloads), and
[Stack](http://haskellstack.org/).

Then open Git Bash, [[clone git-annex|download]], and in git-annex's source
tree, run "stack build" to download and
build all dependencies and git-annex. "stack install" will install git-annex.

(To build the git-annex installer, you also need to install the NullSoft
installer system, see Build/NullSoftInstaller.hs for details.)
