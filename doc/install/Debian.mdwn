## Debian testing or unstable

Debian unstable and testing are usually fairly up to date,
so this should be enough:

	sudo apt install git-annex

## Debian 9.0 "stretch"

Debian's stable release contains git-annex version 6.20170101.

	sudo apt install git-annex

A newer version of git-annex is available in backports.

## Standalone backports for all releases

If the version shipped with Debian is too old, 
the [NeuroDebian team](http://neuro.debian.net/) provides a
[standalone build package](http://neuro.debian.net/pkgs/git-annex-standalone.html)
that is regularly updated and that should work across all releases of
Debian.
