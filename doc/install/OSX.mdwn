For easy installation, use the prebuilt app bundle.

* 10.15 Catalina: [git-annex.dmg](https://downloads.kitenet.net/git-annex/OSX/current/10.15_Catalina/git-annex.dmg)

To run the [[git-annex_assistant|/assistant]], just
install the app, look for the icon, and start it up. 

To use git-annex at the command line, you can add
`git-annex.app/Contents/MacOS` to your `PATH`

Alternatively, from the command line you can run
`git-annex.app/Contents/MacOS/runshell`, which makes your shell use all the
programs bundled inside the app, including not just git-annex, but git, and
several more. Handy if you don't otherwise have git installed.

## autobuilds

An autobuild is also available, thanks to the Datalad project.
