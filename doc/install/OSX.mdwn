For easy installation, use the prebuilt app bundle.

* 10.11 El Capitan / 10.10 Yosemite / 10.9 Mavericks: [git-annex.dmg](https://downloads.kitenet.net/git-annex/OSX/current/10.10_Yosemite/git-annex.dmg)
* 10.8.2 Mountain Lion: [git-annex.dmg.bz2](https://downloads.kitenet.net/git-annex/OSX/current/10.8.2_Mountain_Lion/git-annex.dmg.bz2) **warning: not being updated any longer**
* 10.7.5 Lion: [git-annex.dmg](https://downloads.kitenet.net/git-annex/OSX/current/10.7.5_Lion/git-annex.dmg) **warning: not being updated any longer**

To run the [[git-annex_assistant|/assistant]], just
install the app, look for the icon, and start it up. 

To use git-annex at the command line, you can add
`git-annex.app/Contents/MacOS` to your `PATH`

Alternatively, from the command line you can run
`git-annex.app/Contents/MacOS/runshell`, which makes your shell use all the
programs bundled inside the app, including not just git-annex, but git, and
several more. Handy if you don't otherwise have git installed.

## autobuilds
