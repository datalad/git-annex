I don't know much about the static-annex builds, but you may have better
luck with the [[Linux_standalone]] builds due to their using a more
conventional libc.

Building git-annex from source is not hard if you can get the stack tool
installed. It looks like the only currently supported way to do that as a
freebsd user is to install <https://www.haskell.org/ghcup/> which includes
stack. Then follow the [[fromsource]] section on "building from source with
stack".
