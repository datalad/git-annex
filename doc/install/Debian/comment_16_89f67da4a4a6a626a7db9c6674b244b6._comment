I'm tring to set up a bare repo on a debian squeeze server and sync it to windows client. Unfortunately the direct mode does not seem to be available for the git-annex version (3.20120629~bpo60+2
) in the squeeze-backports 

Would you be able to update the version in that repository? Thank you for your hard work! Git-annex is awesome
