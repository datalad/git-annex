[Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) has [a formula](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/git-annex) for git-annex.

Warning: Homebew enables telemetry by default, which is not a good practice.
If you are surprised by it doing this, see [here](https://docs.brew.sh/Analytics)
and you may want to run `brew analytics off`.

Homebrew users can simply run `brew install git-annex` to install git-annex.

## buiding git-annex from sources

This is the old recipe for building git-annex from source, using
packages from homebrew. Useful if you want a newer version than the version
in homebrew.

<pre>
brew install haskell-platform git ossp-uuid md5sha1sum coreutils gnutls libidn gsasl pkg-config libxml2
brew link libxml2 --force
cabal update
mkdir $HOME/bin
PATH=$HOME/bin:$PATH
PATH=$HOME/.cabal/bin:$PATH
cabal install c2hs --bindir=$HOME/bin
cabal install gnuidn
cabal install git-annex --bindir=$HOME/bin
