@Dan I would not be surprised if cabal v2-install 
does not support installing man pages like the old
v1-install does. When I tried it, it seemed not to.

The Makefile has an `install-mans` target
that could be used instead. There are several other things
that `make install` does that cabal cannot, including installing
completions files, so system integrators (like homebrew) 
should probably use it when they can.
