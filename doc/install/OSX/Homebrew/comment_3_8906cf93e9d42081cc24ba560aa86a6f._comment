Homebrew doesn't seem to install the remote helper (`git remote-annex` is not a known command).

Building from source doesn't work because brew installs base>4.20 which is incompatible with filepath-bytestring. Since homebrew is against backward compatibility I presume changing base version by installing a different ghc is out of the question.

Maybe there's a way to do this with sandboxes? I'm not familiar with haskell, can anyone update the build recipe on how to build git-annex on MacOS (Apple silicon)? As I understand it one would need:

1. `brew install ghc cabal-install haskell-stack` instead of `haskell-platform`
1. option `--bindir -> --installdir`
1. To specify `extra-lib-dirs` and `extra-include-dirs` to `/opt/homebrew/(lib|include)` respectively in cabal config or as additional options
1. `base` version `< 4.20` must be installed when installing `ghc`

This is where I got stuck because I can't reinstall `base` without understanding sandboxes or installing a different GHC version (I think? This is effectively my first exposure to haskell)
