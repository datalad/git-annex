This command worked for me `brew install --build-from-source git-annex`

`brew install git-annex` gave me the following error on macOS Big Sur v11.5.2 (MacBook Air (M1 2020))

```bash
Error: git-annex: no bottle available!
You can try to install from source with:
  brew install --build-from-source git-annex
Please note building from source is unsupported. You will encounter build
failures with some formulae. If you experience any issues please create pull
requests instead of asking for help on Homebrew's GitHub, Twitter or any other
official channels.
