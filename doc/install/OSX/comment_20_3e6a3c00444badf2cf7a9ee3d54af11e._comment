I'm using the annex assistant from the annex bundle for the convenience, but sometimes I use git-annex directly from the command line. I have /Applications/git-annex.app/Contents/MacOS/ in my path, but is there any way you could build the app bundle with the manpage in there so I could add it to my MANPATH?
