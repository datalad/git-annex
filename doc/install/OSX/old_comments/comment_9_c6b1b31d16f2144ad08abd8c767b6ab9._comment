if you are having trouble installing with `cabal install git-annex` at the moment, trouble of the XML kind, you'll need to do a couple things:

`brew update`
`brew install libxml2`
`cabal update`
`cabal install libxml --extra-include-dirs=/usr/local/Cellar/libxml2/2.8.0/include/libxml2 --extra-lib-dirs=/usr/local/Cellar/libxml2/2.8.0/lib`

well, then i hit a brick wall.

well.

I got it to work by manually symlinking from `../Cellar/libxml2/2.8.0/lib/`* into `/usr/local` and from `../../Cellar/libxml2/2.8.0/lib/` to `/usr/local/pkgconfig`, but i can't recommend it or claim to be too proud about it all.

OS X already has an old libxml knocking around so this might ruin everything for me.

let's find out !
