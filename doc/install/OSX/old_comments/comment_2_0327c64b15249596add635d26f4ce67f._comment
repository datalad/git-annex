The Haskell Platform installer for OSX uses GHC 7.0.4, which doesn't seem able to support the current version of git-annex.

Cabal throws a very cryptic error about not being able to use the proper base package.

I was able to install it by 

1.  cloning the repo
2.  merging the ghc7.0 branch
3.  resolving merge conflicts in git-annex.cabal
4.  cabal install git-annex.cabal

(Note I also tried this with homebrew and had similar results)
