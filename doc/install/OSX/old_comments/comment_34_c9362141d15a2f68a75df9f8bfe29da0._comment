Just to mention that the beta dated 24 Oct 2013 and Joey's autobuild of 27 Oct both don't start with the following error message for git-annex, git-annex-webapp under Mac OS X 10.9 Maverick with latest XCode installed: 

    dyld: Symbol not found: _objc_debug_taggedpointer_mask
      Referenced from: /System/Library/Frameworks/CoreFoundation.framework/Versions/A/CoreFoundation
      Expected in: /Applications/git-annex.app/Contents/MacOS/bundle/I

    Trace/BPT trap: 5

Many thanks. Can I help?
