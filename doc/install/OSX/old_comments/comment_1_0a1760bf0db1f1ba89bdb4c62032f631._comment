You can also use Homebrew instead of MacPorts.  Homebrew's `haskell-platform` is up-to-date, too:

    brew install haskell-platform git ossp-uuid md5sha1sum coreutils pcre
    ln -s /usr/local/include/pcre.h /usr/include/pcre.h

As of this writing, however, Homebrew's `md5sha1sum` has a broken mirror.  I wound up getting that from MacPorts anyway.
