I came across an issue when following the instructions here:
     <http://git-annex.branchable.com/install/OSX/>

I'm compiling the 'assistant' branch (522f568450a005ae81b24f63bb37e75320b51219).


The pre-compiled version of Haskell for OSX recommends the 32 bit installer, however git-annex compiles

>  Utility/libdiskfree.o Utility/libkqueue.o Utility/libmounts.o

as 64 bit. The 'make' command fails on linking 32- and 64-bit code.

So... I made a small change to the Makefile

>  CFLAGS=-Wall

becomes

>  CFLAGS=-Wall -m32

I don't know if there is an easy way to programmatically check for this, or even if you'd want to spend time doing it, but it might help someone else out.
