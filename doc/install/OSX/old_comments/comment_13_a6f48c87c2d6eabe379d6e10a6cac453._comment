â€¦and another approach to the same problem: apparently git-annex also relies on the GNU coreutils (for instance, when doing `git annex get .`, `cp` complains about `illegal option -- -`). I do have the GNU coreutils installed with Homebrew, but they are all prefixed with `g`. So maybe you should try `gsha256sum` and `gcp` before `sha256sum` and `cp`, that seems like a more general solution.
