$(brew --prefix) should, in most cases, be /usr/local.  That's the recommended install location for homebrew.

I already had git installed and homebrew as my package manager - my install steps were as follows:

1. brew install haskell-platform ossp-uuid md5sha1sum coreutils pcre
2. PATH=\"$(brew --prefix coreutils)/libexec/gnubin:$PATH\" cabal install git-annex
