Hello,

I just compiled git-annex using cabal on OS X, and I see there is no dbus support:

    Assistant/Threads/NetWatcher.hs:26:0:
         warning: #warning Building without dbus support; will poll for network connection changes
    
    Assistant/Threads/MountWatcher.hs:33:0:
         warning: #warning Building without dbus support; will use mtab polling

Is this problematic? I see I can install dbus using homebrew. If I do so, will I have dbus support (after recompiling git-annex)?
