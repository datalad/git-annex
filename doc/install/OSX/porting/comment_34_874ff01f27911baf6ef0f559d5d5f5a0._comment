Following the Mac OS X brew instructions from the top of the board, I got the following error:

[5 of 5] Compiling Yesod            ( Yesod.hs, dist/build/Yesod.o )
In-place registering yesod-1.2.5...
Installing library in /Users/srinathv/.cabal/lib/yesod-1.2.5/ghc-7.6.3
Registering yesod-1.2.5...
Installed yesod-1.2.5
cabal: Error: some packages failed to install:
git-annex-5.20140210 depends on libxml-sax-0.7.4 which failed to install.
libxml-sax-0.7.4 failed during the configure step. The exception was:
ExitFailure 1
network-protocol-xmpp-0.4.5 depends on libxml-sax-0.7.4 which failed to
install.


Then I perused the comments and did:
$brew link libmxl2 --force
$cabal install git-annex --bindir=$HOME/bin

with success.
