Rather than specifying --bindir on the command line for cabal, I edited my ~/.cabal/config to add this line:

    symlink-bindir: /usr/local/bin

This installs the binaries to ~/.cabal/bin but symlinks them into /usr/local/bin alongside the links that homebrew installs. Additionally, I symlinked /usr/local/bin/git-annex-shell to /usr/local/bin/git-annex which made things work great from remote hosts via ssh.
