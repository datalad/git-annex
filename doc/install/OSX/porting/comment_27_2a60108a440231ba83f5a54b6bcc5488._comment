The [FSevents framework itself has been around since leopard](http://arstechnica.com/apple/2007/10/mac-os-x-10-5/7/).

[This fsevents wrapper project](https://github.com/rastersize/CDEvents) supports snow leopard and even leopard, maybe it will provide some clues on how it was done.

I'm guessing it would be worth it, [snow leopard is still the most popular OSX as of April](http://www.patentlyapple.com/patently-apple/2013/04/snow-leopard-remains-the-most-popular-version-of-os-x.html). From my own experience, snow leopard is a huge life extender for 2+ year old hardware. Lion just makes them sluggishly painful to use.

Maybe someone could volunteer an SL machine for remote development? Sorry, mine are tied down :(
