I'm trying to build git-annex with dbus support, and even though I installed dbus (through homebrew), at the end of compilation I get the warning about \"building without dbus\". Is there something special I need to do for git-annex to see I have installed dbus?

(Also, it tells me at the beginning that I don't have gcrypt, but libgcrypt is installed.)
