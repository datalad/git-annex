I think I dragged you out of dev mode for commenting unnecessarily, sorry about that. Apparently, [Lion](http://www.redmondpie.com/os-x-lion-vs-os-x-snow-leopard-head-to-head-performance-showdown/) and [Mountain Lion are fine on older hardware](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/58453/will-mountain-lion-make-an-older-computer-run-faster-or-slower). For a while [a daemon cause Lion slowdowns for a day after upgrade](https://discussions.apple.com/message/15719036) for a while, which was enough to cause a reputation.
