I was able to build snow leopard completely for the first time over last night (it took a very long time to build all the tools and dependancies).  Woohoo!

The way I was able to fully build on a 32-bit 10.6 machine was this

1. Delete ~/.ghc and ~/.cabal.  They were full of random things and were causing problems.
2. `brew uninstall ghc and haskell-platform`
3. `brew update`
4. `brew install git ossp-uuid md5sha1sum coreutils libgsasl gnutls libidn libgsasl pkg-config libxml2`
5. `brew upgrade git ossp-uuid md5sha1sum coreutils libgsasl gnutls libidn libgsasl pkg-config libxml2` (Some of these were already installed/up to date.
6. `brew link libxml2`
7. `brew install haskell-platform`  (This takes a long, long time).
8. `cabal update` (assuming you have added `~/.cabal/bin` to your path
9. `cabal install cablal-install`
10. `cabal install c2hs`
11. `cabal install git-annex`


It also appears to be running fairly smoothly than it had in the past on a 32-bit SL system.  Thats also neat.  

The problem is that it seems to not really work as git annex though, probably due to the error relating you get when you start up the webapp:
Running
`git annex webapp` 
The browser starts up, and I get 3 of these errors:
`Watcher crashed: Need at least OSX 10.7.0 for file-level FSEvents`

Pairing with a local computer appears to work to systems running 10.7, but when you complete the process, they never show up in the repository list.


Also on a side note, when running `git annex webapp` it triggers the opening of an html file in whatever the default html file handler is.  I edit a lot of html, so for me that is usually a text editor.  I had to change the file handler to open html files with my web browser for the `git annex webapp` to actually work.  Is there a way to change that so that `git annex webapp` uses the default web browser for the system rather than the default html file handler?
