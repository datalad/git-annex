Bad news, it looks like I'm not able to install git-annex to my machine: When I run

    sudo cabal install c2hs git-annex --bindir=$HOME/bin

I get the following error:

    cabal: Error: some packages failed to install:
    DAV-0.3 failed during the building phase. The exception was:
    ExitFailure 11
    git-annex-3.20130114 depends on yesod-core-1.1.7.1 which failed to install.

What does *ExitFailure 11* mean?
