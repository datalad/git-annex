@Kristian, a new version of the DNS library has caused this. A workaround is to pass `-f-DNS` to the cabal command.

I am in the process of adding support for the new DNS library version in git now.

By the way, please [[file_a_bug|bugs]] if you have a big ugly looking build failure like that, so as to not clutter up this page.
