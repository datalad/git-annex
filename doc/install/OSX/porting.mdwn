If you cannot get a OSX build of git-annex suitable for your computer,
from eg [[HomeBrew]] or the regular [[OSX]] prebuilt app, you
can try building git-annex from source on OSX, using haskell's cabal package
manager.

For general instructions on building git-annex from source see
[[install/fromsource]]
