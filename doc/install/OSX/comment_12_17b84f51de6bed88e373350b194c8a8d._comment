The OSX 10.10 build works fine on my 10.11 El Capitan machine.   Updated this page to reflect that.

git-annex is also in 'brew cask', automating installation from the OSX binaries.   I've sent  [PR 18105](https://github.com/caskroom/homebrew-cask/pull/18105) to the brew cask team to get the cask to work for 10.11.
