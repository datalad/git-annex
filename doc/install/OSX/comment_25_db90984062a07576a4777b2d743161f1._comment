I have fiddled with the fresh (as of Oct 2nd) build of assistant on OS X 10.8.5, and there has been a lot of problems with bundled software

bundled git is an old 1.7.x version which keeps saying in the daemon logs it is too old to honor .gitignores etc
at the same time I have git 1.8.4 installed through homebrew which works very nicely throughout my system

I also have homebrew-installed gpg2:

$ gpg2 --version
gpg (GnuPG) 2.0.21
libgcrypt 1.5.3

(and have briefly experimented with using GPGSuite from gpgtools.org, which kept bailing with invalid autolocate directive in gpg.conf)

however there is some unidentifiable gpg binary bundled with the assistant, which cannot connect to gpg-agent from gpg2, and doesn't work with GPGSuite (see above)

is there a way to completely forgo usage of bundled software and have the webapp use whatever is already available on the system?
