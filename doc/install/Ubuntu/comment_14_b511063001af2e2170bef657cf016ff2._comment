@Dennis, I just got a backport of the latest release (5.20150113) running under trusty.  This was my first attempt at backporting software and it ended up being a fairly big project.  I had to pull in a lot of haskell dependencies from vivid in order to get this to build.

I'll attempt to keep this PPA up-to-date as long as I don't have to do too much more build dep wrangling.
