Jeff, AFAIK the 3.20120406 in precise does not include the assistant at all. The Precise PPA is well up-to-date. 
I don't think git-annex has anyone in Ubuntu updating the package, so it's whatever version is synced periodically from Debian.

(AFAICS, all the problems Jeff had were due to manually creating an indirect mode repository when he expected direct mode.)
