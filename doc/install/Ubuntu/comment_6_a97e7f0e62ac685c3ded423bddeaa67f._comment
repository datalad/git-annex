Ah, does it only have the webapp? I was able to boot the webapp and see messages, and it looked mostly the same, I assumed it was broken since no syncing was happening, but that would be due to the assistant not being there.

I guess it's hard as a new user that goes straight for the easy/out-of-the box solution, via the assistant, after watching your video on it. I just assumed things were broken since I was seeing slightly different things. I didn't understand that the assistant was separate from the webapp (and was missing).

Maybe mentioning the minimum required version on the assistant page to at least prompt users to check the version they're getting? I assumed following the link to the install guide, and installing the package for Ubuntu, would give me what I needed.
