13.04 Raring also has fairly outdated packages: 3.20121112ubuntu4
Is there a PPA or some such for this? I suppose since Saucy will be out soon this is less critical, but would still be useful.

These don't have direct mode, which (I think; I haven't tested it yet) is the feature I've been waiting for.
