If your Linux distribution does not have git-annex packaged up for you,
you can either build it [[fromscratch]], or you can use a handy
prebuilt tarball of the most recent release.

This tarball should work on most Linux systems. It has basically no
dependencies and is self-contained.

* i386: [download tarball](https://downloads.kitenet.net/git-annex/linux/current/git-annex-standalone-i386.tar.gz)
* amd64: [download tarball](https://downloads.kitenet.net/git-annex/linux/current/git-annex-standalone-amd64.tar.gz)
* armel: [download tarball](https://downloads.kitenet.net/git-annex/linux/current/git-annex-standalone-armel.tar.gz)

To use, just unpack the tarball, `cd git-annex.linux` and run `./runshell`
-- this sets up an environment where you can use `git annex`, as well
as everything else included in the bundle.

Alternatively, you can unpack the tarball, and add the directory to your
`PATH`, or symlink the programs in the directory to a directory in your
PATH. This lets you use `git annex`, without overriding your system's
own versions of git, etc.

The armel version can be installed on NAS devices and other embedded ARM
linux systems.

## autobuilds

A daily build is also available, thanks to Mesar Hameed and the University
of Bath CS department.
