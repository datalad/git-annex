If your Linux distribution does not have git-annex packaged up for you,
you can either build it [[fromsource]], or you can use a handy
prebuilt tarball of the most recent release.

This tarball should work on most Linux systems. It has basically no
dependencies and is self-contained.

* x86-32: [download tarball](https://downloads.kitenet.net/git-annex/linux/current/git-annex-standalone-i386.tar.gz)
* x86-64: [download tarball](https://downloads.kitenet.net/git-annex/linux/current/git-annex-standalone-amd64.tar.gz)
* x86-32, for ancient kernels: [download tarball](https://downloads.kitenet.net/git-annex/linux/current/git-annex-standalone-i386-ancient.tar.gz)
* arm: [download tarball](https://downloads.kitenet.net/git-annex/linux/current/git-annex-standalone-armel.tar.gz)

To use, just unpack the tarball, `cd git-annex.linux` and run `./runshell`
-- this sets up an environment where you can use `git annex`, as well
as everything else included in the bundle.

Alternatively, you can unpack the tarball, and add the directory to your
`PATH`, or symlink the programs in the directory to a directory in your
PATH. This lets you use `git annex`, without overriding your system's
own versions of git, etc.

The arm version can be installed on NAS devices and other embedded ARM
linux systems.

The build for ancient kernels is for use with Linux kernel versions
such as 2.6.32. It will work on both 32 and 64 bit systems.

## autobuilds

An hourly autobuild is also available, thanks to Mesar Hameed and the University
of Bath CS department.

The arm autobuilder runs daily (sun permitting), and is hosted by [[Joey]].

## technical details

The way those tarballs are built is described in [joeyh's blog](http://joeyh.name/blog/entry/completely_linux_distribution-independent_packaging/).
