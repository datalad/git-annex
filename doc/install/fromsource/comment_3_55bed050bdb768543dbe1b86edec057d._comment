If you're installing git-annex with cabal, there is no need to install any haskell library packages with apt-get. That includes libghc-libxml-sax-dev and libghc-zlib-dev. Without those, the apt-get line may work to install the C libraries needed for cabal to install the haskell libraries. 

However, see the the [[Ubuntu]] page for much easier ways to get git-annex installed.
