It took a while and a few tries, but I finally built the git-annex binary including the assistant on a Raspberry Pi. The build comes without the flags webapp, webdav, and dbus as these rely on a Template Haskell compiler that hasn't been ported to Arm architecture yet. 

I put the binary up on Github in case anyone's interested: <https://github.com/tradloff/git-annex-RPi>
