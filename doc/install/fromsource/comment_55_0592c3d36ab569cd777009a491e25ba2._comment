@reyman64, that's a failure to build the feed package, not git-annex.
See <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/feed> for a pointer to its bug
tracker.

The best way to avoid running into such problems is to use stack rather
than cabal to build git-annex, since that avoids using bleeding-edge and
thus frequently broken versions of the dependencies.
