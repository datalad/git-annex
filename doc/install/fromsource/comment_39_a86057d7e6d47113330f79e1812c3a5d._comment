Just an FYI: I tried to \"cabal install --only-dependencies\" with GHC 7.8 and it fails because DAV-1.0.1 is pulling in lens-3.10.3 which is not compatible with GHC 7.8 due to changes in Typeable. 

I don't have enough experience with cabal to figure out why it's not trying to use a newer version of lens.
