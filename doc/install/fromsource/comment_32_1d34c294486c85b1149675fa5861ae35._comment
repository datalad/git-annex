@robohack, the ghc7.0 branch is not being maintained, and is so old I don't recommend it. To build it against current cabal you will probably need to version its dependency on network to an older version than 2.4.0. 

Also, git-annex has not depended on pcre for a long time. But you're building thoroughly old version so get to trip over every bug that's been reported for the past 2 years..
