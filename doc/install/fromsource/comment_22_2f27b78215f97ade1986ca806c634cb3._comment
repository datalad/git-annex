Lately I get this error message when trying to build git-annex-v4.20131002:

    Utility/Hash.hs:7:8:
        Could not find module `Crypto.Hash'
        Perhaps you meant
    	  Crypto.HMAC (needs flag -package crypto-api-0.10.2)
        Use -v to see a list of the files searched for.

crypto-api-0.10.2 is installed as a debian dev package. All the dependencies are met. I have no idea what's going on.
