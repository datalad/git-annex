@Daniel, I suggest you either follow the instuctions above, or if you don't want to follow the instructions, follow the error messages. :P In this case, the instructions say to do:

> PATH=$HOME/bin:$PATH
> cabal install c2hs --bindir=$HOME/bin

Which is exactly to work around the problem that we can see in your transcript: `Installing executable(s) in /root/.cabal/bin` 

Also, to reiterate the top of the page: If you are not comfortable tracking down and dealing with library build problems, installing git-annex with cabal is probably not the right choice for you!
