At the end of the build I got these errors:
Registering yesod-static-1.1.2.3...
Installing library in /home/nrb/.cabal/lib/yesod-static-1.1.2.3/ghc-7.4.1

cabal: Error: some packages failed to install:

language-c-0.3.2.1 failed during the configure step. The exception was:

libxml-sax-0.7.4 failed during the configure step. The exception was:
ExitFailure 1
network-protocol-xmpp-0.4.5 depends on libxml-sax-0.7.4 which failed to

One way I could fix this myself is to put together a VM with 13.10 or Debian in it and work inside that.
Or if I can get help to fix my issues here that would be great ;)
