Can I make armv7 version for alpine Linux? Or WASM?
`git-annex` can't run on iOS without jailbreak.
The only way is to build it on iSH or A-shell.

git-annex(aarch64) is already provided on alpine repo. But iSH supports only armv7. So I can't install git-annex. I tried to build ghc for armv7. But the Haskell foundation has dropped supporting the armv7 since ghc-9. 

A-shell needs WASI binary. I tried ghc-wasm-meta to compile git-annex to WASI binary, But I couldn't handle package version conflicts inside git-annex.
