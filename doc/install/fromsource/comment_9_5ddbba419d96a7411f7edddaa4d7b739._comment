I had - maybe the same problem as Nigel - with ExitFailure 1 libxml-sax-0.7.4 .

I could fix this by forcing the link of libxml2 package with \"brew link libxml2 --force\". Maybe you should update your guide. I had this problem on 2 different machines running both the current versions of OS X.

After this the build finished successfull. Maybe this helps.
