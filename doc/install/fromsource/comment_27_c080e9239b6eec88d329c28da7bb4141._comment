Okay, the error doesn't show up anymore. I didn't even get to Cronner though, because this time I got a different error:

    Assistant/Alert.hs:195:20:
        Couldn't match expected type `Assistant ()' with actual type `()'
        Expected type: Maybe Remote -> Assistant ()
          Actual type: Maybe Remote -> ()
        In the expression: noop
        In an equation for `notFsckedNudge': notFsckedNudge _ = noop

This is from trying to compile 4.20131101 with `-f\"-webapp -webdav\"`
