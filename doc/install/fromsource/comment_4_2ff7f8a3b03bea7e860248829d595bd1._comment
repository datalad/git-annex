@Joey Many thanks.
I am new to Haskell (vaguely looked at it with DARCS) and git-annex.
After installing with apt-get on Ubuntu 12.04 LTS I found webapp was missing, hence have come here.
I am going through the correct steps now, it should be awesome when done.

This seems to be a long build process (still going on my old laptop, much longer than apt-get).
Ubuntu git-annex packages from 13.10 Saucy I think are updated to include webapp.
