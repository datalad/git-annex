Next thing i ran into was missing c2hs.
So
`apt-get install c2hs` before running the cabal install otherwise...

<pre>
$ cabal install git-annex --only-dependencies
Resolving dependencies...
Configuring gnuidn-0.2.1...
cabal: The program c2hs is required but it could not be found.
Failed to install gnuidn-0.2.1
cabal: Error: some packages failed to install:
gnuidn-0.2.1 failed during the configure step. The exception was:
ExitFailure 1
network-protocol-xmpp-0.4.6 depends on gnuidn-0.2.1 which failed to install.
</pre>
