I tried various ways to install git-annex on my [TonidoPlug](http://www.tonidoplug.com/).

System Info:

	root@TonidoPlug2:~# uname -a
	Linux TonidoPlug2 2.6.31.8-topkick1281p2-001-004-20101214 #1 Thu Jun 16 10:06:20 CST 2011 armv5tel GNU/Linux

`apt-get` didn't work.

	root@TonidoPlug2:~# apt-get install git-annex
	Reading package lists... Done
	Building dependency tree       
	Reading state information... Done
	E: Unable to locate package git-annex

The Linux standalone installation results in an error message like this, when calling `git-annex` (or `git annex`)

	~$ git-annex.linux/git-annex
	/home/gitolite/git-annex.linux/bin/git-annex: 1: Syntax error: \")\" unexpected

(git-annex.linux/bin/git-annex is a binary file and works fine on other distros)

When installing with cabal, I get the error message (tried as root and gitolite user)

	~$ cabal install git-annex --bindir=$HOME/bin -f\"-assistant -webapp -webdav -pairing -xmpp -dns\"
	Resolving dependencies...
	cabal: cannot configure git-annex-4.20130802. It requires base >=4.5 && <4.8
	For the dependency on base >=4.5 && <4.8 there are these packages:
	base-4.5.0.0, base-4.5.1.0, base-4.6.0.0 and base-4.6.0.1. However none of
	them are available.
	base-4.5.0.0 was excluded because of the top level dependency base -any
	base-4.5.1.0 was excluded because of the top level dependency base -any
	base-4.6.0.0 was excluded because of the top level dependency base -any
	base-4.6.0.1 was excluded because of the top level dependency base -any

Any help is appreciated.
Thanks for providing git-annex. I started cleaning up my backups with it yesterday and really like it.
