Check out the tag for the release of git-annex that you want to build to
avoid building from master, which may not be ready. In this case, I was
adjusting some build flags this morning and hadn't tried a stack build yet.

git-annex-shell is just a symlink to git-annex. I guess that stack install 
bypasses the code that makes cabal install set up that symlink. You can make
the symlink yourself I suppose.
