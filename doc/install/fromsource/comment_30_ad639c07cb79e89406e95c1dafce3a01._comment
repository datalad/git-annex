The PCRE problem is solved trivially in my case with a couple more cabal install options, though the need for these seems oddly dissatisfying given the reams of other stuff that was successfully built and installed without these options.

Now however I seem to have encountered a deeper problem:

	$ cabal install git-annex --bindir=$HOME/bin --extra-include-dirs=/sw/include --extra-lib-dirs=/sw/lib
