Hello,

Following https://git-annex.branchable.com/install/fromsource/ \"building from source on Debian\" succeeds on Xubuntu 16.04 but fails on Debian 7.11.
First observed on recent commit `ade6ab4` (the one that was used on Xubuntu 16.04) then failed the same way with most recent commit `f244d94` and for tag `debian/6.20160719-1`.

Haskell context was installed on the machine specifically to build git-annex, so there should not be any extraneous package.

Surprisingly, \"make\" and \"cabal\" output rather different messages.

```
make

if [ \"cabal\" = ./Setup ]; then ghc --make Setup; fi
if [ \"cabal\" = stack ]; then \
		cabal build ; \
	else \
		cabal configure --ghc-options=\"\"; \
	fi

```

Any hint? When succeeding the pair of machines will be my first remote ssh-based repo. I need a recent enough build for [mixed content repository](https://git-annex.branchable.com/tips/largefiles/) that would automatically put some types of files in regular git and some other types in annex.
Thanks.
