The git-annex assistant can easily be built on arm. But not the webapp. It's entirely possible to use the assistant without the webapp though; you just have to make the git repository and configure the remotes by hand, and then the assistant will sync them the same way the webapp does.

It is possible but very involved to build the webapp for arm. I do not anticipate doing it in the Debian package until ghc gets proper template haskell support for arm. See [[forum/Webapp_on_ARM]]
