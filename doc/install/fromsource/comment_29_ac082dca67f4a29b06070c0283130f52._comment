After a fresh install of Haskell, and following the instructions above, I end up with the following rather bizarre and unexpected problem:

	$ cabal install git-annex --bindir=$HOME/bin -f\"-assistant -webapp -webdav -pairing -xmpp -dns\"
	Resolving dependencies...
	Configuring pcre-light-0.4...
	Building pcre-light-0.4...
	Preprocessing library pcre-light-0.4...
	Base.hsc:103:18: error: pcre.h: No such file or directory
	Base.hsc: In function ‘main’:
	Base.hsc:402: error: ‘PCRE_ANCHORED’ undeclared (first use in this function)
	Base.hsc:402: error: (Each undeclared identifier is reported only once
	Base.hsc:402: error: for each function it appears in.)
	Base.hsc:405: error: ‘PCRE_AUTO_CALLOUT’ undeclared (first use in this function)

(followed by an error for every other macro that was expected to be defined in the header...)

	compiling dist/build/Text/Regex/PCRE/Light/Base_hsc_make.c failed (exit code 1)
	command was: /usr/bin/gcc -c dist/build/Text/Regex/PCRE/Light/Base_hsc_make.c -o dist/build/Text/Regex/PCRE/Light/Base_hsc_make.o -m64 -fno-stack-protector -m64 -fno-stack-protector -m64 -D__GLASGOW_HASKELL__=700 -Ddarwin_BUILD_OS -Ddarwin_HOST_OS -Dx86_64_BUILD_ARCH -Dx86_64_HOST_ARCH -I/sw/lib/ghc-7.0.4/bytestring-0.9.1.10/include -Idist/build/autogen -include dist/build/autogen/cabal_macros.h -I/sw/lib/ghc-7.0.4/base-4.3.1.0/include -Idist/build/autogen -include dist/build/autogen/cabal_macros.h -Idist/build/autogen -include dist/build/autogen/cabal_macros.h -Idist/build/autogen -include dist/build/autogen/cabal_macros.h -I/sw/lib/ghc-7.0.4/include -Idist/build/autogen -include dist/build/autogen/cabal_macros.h -I/sw/lib/ghc-7.0.4/include -Idist/build/autogen -include dist/build/autogen/cabal_macros.h -I/sw/lib/ghc-7.0.4/include/

	ExitFailure 1

This is a somewhat older Mac OS X 10.6.8 system.

I do have PCRE already installed via Fink, and pcre.h is in /sw/include.  I see other -I/sw/... things in the compile command above, but obviously /sw/include is not one of them.

Any clues for me?

(Why the heck does git-annex need pcre in particular anyway???  I saw another regex library get installed earlier somewhere in this (massive) process.)
