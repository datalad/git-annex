@stephane-gourichon, Control.Monad.Catch is in the haskell exceptions
package, which is a dependency of git-annex. I don't know why it
is failing to find it on your system.

You appear to be in some variety of cabal hell; you probably need to delete
your ~/.cabal and ~/.ghc and start over.

Also, Debian 7.11 is quite old; to follow the "building from source on
Debian" you need Debian unstable, testing, or sometimes stable
(doesn't work currently); not oldstable.
