@erics, thanks for the useful feedback about stack. I've applied your
patch to avoid the Build/InstallDesktopFile problem. And, I made it
automatically set GHC when BUILDER=stack.

Using the Makefile is documented, up in the "building from source on
Debian" section. But there's a set of users who want to use stack,
and don't want to mess around with Makefiles (including users on Windows
without a "make"), and that's who the stack instructions are kind of
targeted at. It's an unfortunate problem with stack that it doesn't provide
any way to make the git-annex-shell symlink.

I am doubtful that --allow-different-user is a good idea. I sometimes
use stack to build git-annex for testing purposes, but I have never
built it with stack and installed that with `sudo make install`.
And it may well be that there's not a reasonable way to make that work;
and the install target is mostly intended for use by distributions that
are creating a package of git-annex, who probably set PREFIX and don't run
it as root.
