I'm having problems installing from cabal, and it seems related to yesod. I found an older discussion on something similar, where a constraint to require a newer version of yesod had been added, but I haven't figured out what was done to solve it.

The problem seems to be that git-annex requires yesod < 1.2, but cabal is unable to install an older version.

    $ cabal install git-annex --bindir=$HOME/bin
    Resolving dependencies...
    cabal: Could not resolve dependencies:
    trying: git-annex-4.20130601
    trying: git-annex-4.20130601:+webapp
    rejecting: yesod-1.2.1.1, 1.2.1, 1.2.0.1, 1.2.0 (conflict:
    git-annex-4.20130601:webapp => yesod(<1.2))
    trying: yesod-1.1.9.3
    $

From what I can tell, the problem is fixed in github master since yesod >= 1.2 is supported again.
