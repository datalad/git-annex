Hello everyone.

Be aware that your distribution's package may be very old.
For example, at the time I write this, latest Debian stable is Debian 7.5 which is 2 months old.
But git-annex package there is two *years* old (tomorrow, it will be exactly two yezrs old).

So, beware.  If following [online walkthrough](https://git-annex.branchable.com/walkthrough/), either install a more recent git-annex (e.g. from [Debain backports](http://backports.debian.org/Instructions/)) or follow instructions from your local `/usr/share/doc/git-annex/html/walkthrough.html` instead.
