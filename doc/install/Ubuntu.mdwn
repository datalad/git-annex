Ubuntu has a git-annex package, so to install simply run:
	
	sudo apt-get install git-annex

## backport

If the version shipped with Ubuntu is too old, 
the [NeuroDebian team](http://neuro.debian.net/) provides a
[standalone build package](http://neuro.debian.net/pkgs/git-annex-standalone.html)
that is regularly updated and that should work across all releases of
Ubuntu.
