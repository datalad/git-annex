Right now, the git-annex package in community is quite outdated (2016-06).

If you wish to install a newer version, you can use git-annex-git from AUR instead. You will need to disable S3 support in the PKGBUILD (and perhaps add haskell-core in pacman.conf), because haskell-hs3 doesn't seem to be available (Not that I looked too hard, as I don't use it..).
