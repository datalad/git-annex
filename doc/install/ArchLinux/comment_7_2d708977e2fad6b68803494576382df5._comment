@rado The Haskel dependencies can be a nightmare to sort out for the un-initiated. You can side-step the whole issue by uninstalling the pre-built version that that has all the dependencies built in out of the box.

Just grab the git-annex-bin package from the AUR and be done with it. (The -bin and -standalone packages recently merged so there is just -bin now).
