@CandyAngel the Arch package in community has only been flagged as out of date since last week. It usually takes about a week once packages get flagged for the updates to drop. If it doesn't drop by the end of this week we can file a bug and get somebody on it. Using the -git package from AUR should not be necessary to get the latest released version of software on arch. If it is something is broken and should be fixed.
