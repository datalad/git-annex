When I try to build in from source on Fedora 17, I get this error:

[ 77 of 163] Compiling Utility.DiskFree ( Utility/DiskFree.hs, dist/build/git-annex/git-annex-tmp/Utility/DiskFree.o )
[ 78 of 163] Compiling Utility.Url      ( Utility/Url.hs, dist/build/git-annex/git-annex-tmp/Utility/Url.o )

Utility/Url.hs:111:88:
    Couldn't match expected type `Maybe URI' with actual type `URI'
    In the second argument of `fromMaybe', namely
      `(newURI `relativeTo` u)'
    In the expression: fromMaybe newURI (newURI `relativeTo` u)
    In an equation for `newURI_abs':
        newURI_abs = fromMaybe newURI (newURI `relativeTo` u)

Any help?
