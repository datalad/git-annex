Edit Utility/Url.hs and play around with the version in the `MIN_VERSION_network` define.  It seems to me that your system needs to build with the #else branch of the #ifdef, despite having a version of the haskell network package older than 2.4.0. It's possible that the haskell network package has been modified by Fedora.
