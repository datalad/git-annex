@Michele, you seem to have an old version of the haskell DAV library installed. The simple solutions is probably `cabal install DAV` to upgrade to the new one.

(The complex solution is to edit the file and copy the line 2 lines above the error, or fix the ifdefs somehow to work with whatever combination of versions of DAV and http-client or http-conduit you have installed.)
