i share my experience in installing from source on fc19, I must admit these are useful only for haskell novices:
should cabal complain about missing libffi.so.5 (as it happened to me), do 

     yum install compat-libffi

and you'll get the missing library (the shipping version with fc19 is libffi.so.6)
also: in order for the git annex to be picked up globally or better to end up in the default path i had to:

     cabal install --global
