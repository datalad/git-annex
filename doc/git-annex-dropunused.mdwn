# NAME

git-annex dropunused - drop unused file content

# SYNOPSIS

git annex dropunused `[number|range ...]`

# DESCRIPTION

Drops the data corresponding to the numbers, as listed by the last
git annex unused`

You can also specify ranges of numbers, such as "1-1000".
Or, specify "all" to drop all unused data.

# OPTIONS

* `--from=remote`

  Rather than dropping the unused files from the local repository,
  drop them from the remote repository.

* `--force`

  Use this option with care! It bypasses safety checks, and forces
  git-annex to delete the content of the specified files, even from
  the last repository that is storing their content. Data loss can
  result from using this option.
