# NAME

git-annex migrate - switch data to different backend

# SYNOPSIS

git annex migrate `[path ...]`

# DESCRIPTION

Changes the specified annexed files to use the default key-value backend
(or the one specified with `--backend`). Only files whose content
is currently available are migrated.

Note that the content is also still available using the old key after
migration. Use `git annex unused` to find and remove the old key.

Normally, nothing will be done to files already using the new backend.
However, if a backend changes the information it uses to construct a key,
this can also be used to migrate files to use the new key format.

When you have multiple repositories that each contain a copy of a file,
it's best to run migrate in all of them.

# OPTIONS

* `--backend`

  Specify the new key-value backend to use for migrated data.

* `--force`

  Force migration of keys that are already using the new backend.

* file matching options
 
  The [[git-annex-matching-options]](1)
  can be used to specify files to migrate.
