# NAME

git-annex direct - switch repository to direct mode

# SYNOPSIS

git annex direct

# DESCRIPTION

Switches a repository to use direct mode, where rather than symlinks to
files, the files are directly present in the repository.
  
As part of the switch to direct mode, any changed files will be committed.

Note that git commands that operate on the work tree will refuse to
run in direct mode repositories. Use `git annex proxy` to safely run such
commands.

Note that the direct mode/indirect mode distinction is removed in v6
git-annex repositories. In such a repository, you can
use [[git-annex-unlock]](1) to make a file's content be directly present.
You can also use [[git-annex-adjust]](1) to enter a branch where all
annexed files are unlocked, which is similar to the old direct mode.
