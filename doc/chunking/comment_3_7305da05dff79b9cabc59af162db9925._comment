I always use this

    git show git-annex:remote.log

to print the current configurations of all remotes.   It should have all the arguments you passed to `initremote` or `enableremote`.  If there is a better way, I would also like to know.

(the git command prints the content of the file `remote.log` from branch `git-annex`)
