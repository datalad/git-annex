# NAME

git-annex info - information about an item or the repository

# SYNOPSIS

git annex info `[directory|file|treeish|remote|description|uuid ...]`

# DESCRIPTION

Displays statistics and other information for the specified item,
which can be a directory, or a file, or a treeish, or a remote,
or the description or uuid of a repository.

When no item is specified, displays statistics and information
for the local repository and all annexed content.

# OPTIONS

* `--fast`

  Only show the data that can be gathered quickly.

* `--json`

  Enable JSON output. This is intended to be parsed by programs that use
  git-annex. Each line of output is a JSON object corresponding to a item
  being processed.

* `--json-error-messages`

  Adds an "error-messages" field to the JSON that contains messages that
  would normally be output to the standard error when processing a item.

* `--json-exceptions`

  Output additional JSON objects for some exceptions that are not
  associated with a particular item.

* `--bytes`

  Show file sizes in bytes, disabling the default nicer units.

* `--batch`

  Enable batch mode, in which a line containing an item is read from stdin,
  the information about it is output to stdout, and repeat.

* `-z`

  Makes the `--batch` input be delimited by nulls instead of the usual
  newlines.

* `--autoenable`

  Display a list of special remotes that have been configured to
  autoenable.  

* matching options

  The [[git-annex-matching-options]](1) can be used to select what
  to include in the statistics.

* Also the [[git-annex-common-options]](1) can be used.

# EXAMPLES

Suppose you want to run "git annex get .", but
would first like to see how much disk space that will use.
Then run:
  
	git annex info --fast . --not --in here
