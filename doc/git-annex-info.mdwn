# NAME

git-annex info - information about an item or the repository

# SYNOPSIS

git annex info `[directory|file|treeish|remote|description|uuid ...]`

# DESCRIPTION

Displays statistics and other information for the specified item,
which can be a directory, or a file, or a treeish, or a remote,
or the description or uuid of a repository.
  
When no item is specified, displays statistics and information
for the local repository and all known annexed files.

# OPTIONS

* `--fast`

  Only show the data that can be gathered quickly.

* `--json`

  Enable JSON output. This is intended to be parsed by programs that use
  git-annex. Each line of output is a JSON object.

* `--json-error-messages`

  Messages that would normally be output to standard error are included in
  the json instead.

* `--bytes`

  Show file sizes in bytes, disabling the default nicer units.

* `--batch`

  Enable batch mode, in which a line containing an item is read from stdin,
  the information about it is output to stdout, and repeat.

* `-z`

  Makes the `--batch` input be delimited by nulls instead of the usual
  newlines.

* file matching options

  When a directory is specified, the [[git-annex-matching-options]](1)
  can be used to select the files in the directory that are included
  in the statistics.

* Also the [[git-annex-common-options]](1) can be used.

# EXAMPLES

Suppose you want to run "git annex get .", but
would first like to see how much disk space that will use.
Then run:
  
	git annex info --fast . --not --in here
