# NAME

git-annex version - show version info

# SYNOPSIS

git annex version

# DESCRIPTION

Shows the version of git-annex, as well as repository version information.

git-annex's version is in the form MAJOR.DATE, where MAJOR is a number
like 5, which corresponds to the current repository version, and DATE
is the date of the last release, like 20150320.

Daily builds of git-annex will append a "-gREF" to the version, which
corresponds to the git ref from git-annex's source repository that was
built. Therefore, "5.20150320-gdd35cf3" is a daily build, and
"5.20150401" is an April 1st release made a bit later.
