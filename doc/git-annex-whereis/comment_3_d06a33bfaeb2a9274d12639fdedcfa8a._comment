Repo that contains the latest/current version of a file is not accessible. Can git annex whereis find the last available version of a file in other repos (or a specific repo)?

I can looping through commit log and running whereis for each commit until an earlier version of a file is found, but perhaps there is a better way to do it with a single command?
