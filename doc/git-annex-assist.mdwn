# NAME

git-annex assist - add files and sync changes with remotes

# SYNOPSIS

git annex assist `[remote ...]`

# DESCRIPTION

This command assists you in checking files into the repository
and syncing with remotes. It's the simplest possible way to use git-annex
at the command line, since only this one command needs to be run on a
regular basis.

This command first adds any new files (in the current directory and
its children) to the repository, and commits those as well as any
modified files. Then it does the equivilant of running
[[git-annex-pull](1) followed by [[git-annex-push]](1).

To block some files from being added to the repository, use `.gitignore`
files.

By default, all files that are added are added to the annex, the same
as when you run `git annex add`. If you configure annex.largefiles,
files that it does not match will instead be added with `git add`.

# OPTIONS
