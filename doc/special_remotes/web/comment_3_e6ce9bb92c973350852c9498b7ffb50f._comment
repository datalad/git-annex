First a few questions:
1. is this backend supposed to be recursive or does it supports that?
2. does it need a download command in the following format: 
  <program> <url>

I assumed this 2 are true.

Well rsync, sftp and scp need a second <to> paramater, they did not work.

So I wrote a small wrapper to add the default \".\" as target location:

filename: rsync-get
#!/usr/bin/env bash
rsync -r \"$1\" .

sadly still no sucess:

~/annex $ git annex addurl -c annex.web-download-command=rsync-get mars:/mnt/data/folder/
addurl _mnt_data_folder_ (downloading mars:/mnt/data/folder/ ...) 
failed
git-annex: addurl: 1 failed
CallStack (from HasCallStack):
  error, called at ./CmdLine/Action.hs:41:28 in main:CmdLine.Action

I also tried it with a url to a file, in the case that it not supports recursive operations, that did not work, too.
