Hi,

Is the bup remote available via the Assistant user interface?

Unrelated question;

If you are syncing files between two bup repos on local usb drives, does it use git to sync the changes or does it use \"bup split\" to re-add the file? (Basically, is the syncing as efficient as possible using git-annex or would I have to go to a lower level)

Many Thanks,
Sek
