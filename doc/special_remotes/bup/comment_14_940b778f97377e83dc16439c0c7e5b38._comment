@darkfeline, setting buprepo= causes git-annex to run bup with -r. 
You can verify this by using the --debug switch.

IIRC, bup still creates ~/.bup when used this way, but doesn't store the
contents of annexed files there. It uses it only to store some small index
files, which are also stored in the repo specified with -r. This seems
weird, but I don't think this is a bug on bup's part; it seems to
intentionally do that, using path names in ~/.bup that are constructed to
not conflict when -r is used with different repositories.
I suppose bup has a good reason to do this, though I don't know what the
reason is.

I can blow ~/.bup away, run "bup init" to make a fresh clean ~/.bup,
and then git-annex can still get the content of files from the buprepo=
repository. So, it seems that buprepo= is working ok.
