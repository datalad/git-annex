@Albert, thanks for reporting this bug (but put them in [[bugs]] in future please).

This is specific to using the bup special remote with encryption. Without encryption it works. And no, it won't manage to deduplicate anything that's encrypted, as far as I know. 

I think bup-split must have used - for stdin in the past, but now, it just reads from stdin when no file is specified, so I've updated git-annex.
