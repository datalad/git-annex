The buprepo parameter doesn't seem to work properly, at least for local repos.  For example, I added a bup remote with buprepo=/media/hdd/bup, yet when I try to move files onto it, it still tries to use /home/foo/.bup (the default path).  I suppose git-annex should be setting the envvar BUP_DIR before calling bup?

I can do it manually like BUP_DIR=/media/hdd/bup git annex move --to hdd foo, but that almost seems to defeat the purpose...
