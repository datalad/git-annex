Hi,

I would like to uses git-annex in combination with Tahoe-LAFS. The grid will consist of private Servers connected though slow DSL-Lines. Thus I would like to use the Tahoe-LAFS helper feature (like a Tahoe-LAFS upload proxy):

https://tahoe-lafs.org/trac/tahoe-lafs/browser/trunk/docs/helper.rst 

This will result in a different FURL for each location pointing to the same Tahoe-LAFS grid. 

How can I setup two git-annex clients to use two different FURLs for the same remote (the same Tahoe-LAFS grid)?

Thank you very much for your help!

Oliver
