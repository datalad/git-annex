@sanket you need to get your git repositories on the two systems connected
in some way (ie, push one to github, pull in the other one). Once the git
repositories are in sync, `git annex get` can be run in the second repository
and will know how to download files that were uploaded to tahoe from the
first repository.

Nothing tahoe specific here, that's how any git-annex special remote
works..
