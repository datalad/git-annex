I tried your solution but git annex whereis displays the remotes and the uuid of the remotes and not the URI of the file on tahoe.
Example in plain text file name is \"hello.txt\" containing some data and the URI for it in plain text on tahoe is \"URI:CHK:wvyj4ah75mh77oehnwv236jogi:a2d4nx7c7jtyllfle573fgkdvfykci2o2glzknv54vhyo23qb2ya:1:1:110\".

So i intend to find how and where is the plain text URI of the file stored ? Is it stored in some encrypted form? Where/how can i retrieve the plaintext URI.

Also Question 2) You mentioned about git annex branch. Where is the git annex branch? where is the state log?
