@junk, I think the thing for you to do is avoid setting embedcreds=yes.
So, git-annex won't store the furl (or the shared-convergence-secret)
in the git repository.

Instead, you can set TAHOE_FURL in the environment each time
you use `git annex initremote` to set up your tahoe remote in a git-anex
repository. (Also pass shared-convergence-secret=  if you have one.)

Or, you could bypass git-annex's automated setup of tahoe, and set it up
yourself, however works for you. The automated setup is targeted at users
who want to get tahoe working with git-annex but don't have complicated
needs, so maybe it's best for you to just bypass it. The way to do 
that is to set the git config `remote.<name>.tahoe`, to point to a tahoe
coniguration directory. You can do this before running `git annex
initremote`, and it *should* just use that directory. I have not tested
this and may have gone too far in making git-annex automate tahoe setup,
and too hard to use a manual tahoe setup -- please file a bug report if
that doesn't work.
