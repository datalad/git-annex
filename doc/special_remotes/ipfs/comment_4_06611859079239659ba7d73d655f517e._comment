@rob.syme, the reason that does not work when using encryption
is that git-annex internally generates an encrypted key, and stores
that on IPFS. The ipfs special remote records the IPFS address
that can be used for a key, but it's recorded on the encrypted
key, which is not the one you're querying with whereis.

This is a general problem with git-annex; ipfs is probably the
first special remote that exposes the problem.

Anyway, I'm not sure what benefit knowing the IPFS address of a file
encrypted by git-annex is. You need to use git-annex to decrypt it, in
general. You might be able to use your gpg key to decrypt it, if the
special remote was set up using pubkey encryption, but that's not going to
help anyone else you give the IPFS address to access the encrypted data..

Does your use case involve pinning the IPFS address, or something like
that?
