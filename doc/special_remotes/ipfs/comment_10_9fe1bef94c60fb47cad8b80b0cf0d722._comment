IPFS now has an experimental feature for not duplicating file content in the ipfs store, which could be very helpful for this use.  See description at [[https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/issues/3397#issuecomment-284337564]] .

To use this, git-annex needs to pass the `--nocopy` flag when running `ipfs add`.
