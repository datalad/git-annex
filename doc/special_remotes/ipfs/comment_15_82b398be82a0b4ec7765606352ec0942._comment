sorry for the comments that could come across as marketing or spam

i am often in a situation where i have nowhere to back files up, so simply appreciated the free services and thought others might need something similar as well

their terms may have changed by now, not sure. they helped me a lot at the time. i'm now using arweave for doing similar free things, which has a custom protocol but is intended to never kick data out. node2.bundlr.network provides free \"bundlr\" arweave storage for objects 100,000 bytes or smaller.
