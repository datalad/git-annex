Hi Joey,

you are right, the 1-und-1.de implementation of WebDAV does not support locking.

Do you think there is a way to make that service work with git-annex anyhow -- say, by allowing the user to disable file-locking? I've worked around the problem with 1-und-1.de by using fuse+davfs2 to mount the storage in my file system and access it through the directory backend, but FUSE is dead slow, unfortunately, and this solution really sucks.
