I tried it, but I do have som troubles. Changing password seemed to have worked. At least I do think it did say OK. Any further action generates the following response:

$ git annex fsck --from box.com3 Literatur/Science/Papers/Modén/2006.pdf

fsck Literatur/Science/Papers/Modén/2006.pdf (gpg) (checking box.com3...)

git-annex: fsck: 1 failed

It seems it is not available to use the correct password. I tried to use initremote and create a new remote, and this works. In the end no data is lost, as three copies out of my four are still there. I will keep my old remote around for some time if there is any sort of errorfinding that can be done.
