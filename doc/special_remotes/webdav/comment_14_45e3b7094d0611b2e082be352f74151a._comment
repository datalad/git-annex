I have a similar problem to Maarten's, with some potential differences:
* The WebDAV server is actually an ownCloud 7 instance;
* The WebDAV server's SSL cert is issued by CAcert (whose root keys are otherwise installed on my system);
* The cetificate lists the WebDAV VHost's name as an Subject Alt Name rather than its Common Name.

    $ WEBDAV_USERNAME=shtrom WEBDAV_PASSWORD=correcthorsebatterystaple git annex initremote owncloud type=webdav url=https://owncloud/remote.php/webdav/annexdav chunk=10mb encryption=none
    initremote owncloud (testing WebDAV server...)
    git-annex: WebDAV failed to write file: TlsException (HandshakeFailed (Error_Protocol (\"certificate rejected: [NameMismatch \\"owncloud\\"]\",True,CertificateUnknown))): user error
failed
    git-annex: initremote: 1 failed
