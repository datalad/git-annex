I wrote an external remote for [Backblaze's B2](https://www.backblaze.com/b2/cloud-storage.html) object storage service: [git-annex-remote-b2](https://github.com/encryptio/git-annex-remote-b2). I can't be arsed to write a full page on it, but the README covers everything an experienced git-annex user needs to know to use it.
