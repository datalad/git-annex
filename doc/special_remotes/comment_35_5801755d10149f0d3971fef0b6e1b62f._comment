@grawity yes, enableremote is the way to change configuration of an
existing special remote.

The special remote names are a bit funky; to keep the user from needing to
enter in a long uuid when enabling a particular special remote, a name
has to be recorded for the remote, and that becomes shared across clones
of that repository, in a way that the names of git remotes are not
normally. (Normally, my "origin" might be your "upstream" etc.) 

While it could ignore dead remotes when initializing a new remote with an
existing name, then if the old remote got brought back from the dead, there
would be a naming conflict. So, I think it's best to not go down that path,
to avoid the undead horrors lurking there. ;-)
