@bec.watson, better to open a bug report for this kind of problem.

Seems that the [AWS library](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/aws) 
that git-annex is using does not use V4 authorization yet. Work is in 
progress: <https://github.com/aristidb/aws/pull/199>

As to the endpoint hostname, that must be a special case for
China, so I've made git-annex aware of that special case.
