While other remotes store the contents of annexed files somewhere,
this special remote uses a program to compute the contents of annexed
files.

To add a file to a compute special remote, use the [[git-annex-addcomputed]]
command. Once a file has been added to a compute special remote, commands
like `git-annex get` will use it to compute the content of the file.

To enable an instance of this special remote:

    # git-annex initremote myremote type=compute program=git-annex-compute-foo

The `program` parameter is the only required parameter. It is the name of the
program to use to compute the contents of annexed files. It must start with
"git-annex-compute-". The program needs to be installed somewhere in the
`PATH`.

The `autoenable` parameter can be set to "true" like with other special
remotes to make git-annex automatically enable this special remote when
run in a new clone of the repository. However, for security, autoenabling
is only done when the git config `annex.security.autoenable-compute-programs`
includes the name of the compute program.

All other "field=value" parameters passed to `initremote` will be passed
to the program when running [[git-annex-addcomputed]]. Note that when the
program takes a dashed option, it can be provided after "--":

    # git-annex initremote myremote type=compute program=git-annex-compute-foo -- --level=9
