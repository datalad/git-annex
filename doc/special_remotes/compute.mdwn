While other remotes store the contents of annexed files somewhere,
this special remote uses a program to compute the contents of annexed
files.

To enable an instance of this special remote:

    # git-annex initremote myremote type=compute program=git-annex-compute-foo

The `program` parameter is the only required parameter. It is the name of the
program to use to compute the contents of annexed files. It must start with
"git-annex-compute-". The program needs to be installed somewhere in the
`PATH`.

To add a file to a compute special remote, use the [[git-annex-addcomputed]]
command. Once a file has been added to a compute special remote, commands
like `git-annex get` will use it to compute the content of the file.

You can provide other parameters to `initremote`, in order to provide
default configuration values to use when adding files with
[[git-annex-addcomputed]]. To see a list of all the configuration values
supported by a given program, pass `--whatelse` to `initremote`:

    # git-annex initremote myremote type=compute program=git-annex-compute-foo --whatelse

## compute programs

To write programs used by the compute special remote, see the 
[[design/compute_special_remote_interface]].
