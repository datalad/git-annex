  * Google Cloud Storage
  * Google Drive
  * HTTP
  * Hubic

  * Microsoft Azure Blob Storage
  * Microsoft OneDrive

  * Openstack Swift / Rackspace cloud files / Memset Memstore / OVH / Oracle Cloud Storage
  * pCloud
  * QingStor
  * SFTP
  * Webdav / Owncloud / Nextcloud
  * Yandex Disk
  * The local filesystem

That list is regularly expanding. 

There are two ways to use rclone as a git-annex special remote.

1. Install [git-annex-remote-rclone](https://github.com/DanielDent/git-annex-remote-rclone).
   This will work with any versions of rclone and git-annex.
2. With a recent version of rclone and git-annex, it is not necessary to
   install anything else, just use `git-annex initremote type=rclone ...`

   For documentation on using rclone that way, see the output of
   `rclone gitannex -h` or [here](https://github.com/rclone/rclone/blob/master/cmd/gitannex/gitannex.md).
