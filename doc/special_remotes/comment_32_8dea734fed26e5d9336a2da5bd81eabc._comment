@openmedi git-annex doesn't currently keep track of how much space it's
using on a special remote. It's actually quite a difficult problem to do
that in general, since multiple distributed clones of a repository can be
uploading to the same special remote at the same time.

If it runs out of space and transfers fail, git-annex will handle the
failures semi-gracefully, which is to say nothing will stop it from trying
again or trying to send other data, but it will certianly be aware that
files are not reaching the special remote.

If a particular storage service has a way to check free space, it would not
be hard to make git-annex's special remote implementation check it and
avoid trying transfers when it's full.
