I recently faced with a fail 

```
...
export pixel podcasts/<redacted>.mp3 
adb: error: failed to copy '../../.git/annex/objects/17/vK/SHA256E-s57638506--06c92a06db07fa511271e5426c9447cb0fab551d7ba2b9c9d26d3c7e3f975b5c.mp3/SHA256E-s57638506--06c92a06db07fa511271e5426c9447cb0fab551d7ba2b9c9d26d3c7e3f975b5c.mp3' to '/storage/emulated/0/home/media/podcasts/not-related/<redacted>.mp3': remote couldn't create file: Operation not permitted

  adb failed to store file

export: 2 failed
```

Everything is done as usual on the phone, barring two all other files are
succesfully sent. Any clues what might be the cause?
