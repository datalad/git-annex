@craig, this can be slightly confusing, since `git-annex enableremote`
uses the same name that you used when creating the remote in the first
place, with `git-annex initremote`... which might be different than
the name used for that remote in some repository or other, and from
the description shown in `git annex into`.

Since every remote listed by `git annex info` is apparently a regular git
repo, not a special remote, with the exception of the glacier one, process
of deduction suggests that the "gitannexpics" special remote is the same as
the glacier one.

I've made some changes now, so `git annex enableremote` will list the
uuid and description, along with the name used by enableremote, and
will accept any one of those things to specify which remote to enable.
