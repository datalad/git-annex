I think this only happens with some rclone remote backends (like pcloud). The pcloud backend definitely keeps partially uploaded files, under the name of the full file. The backend attempts to do the right thing and uses the `nopartial` option of the pcloud API, but this does not work as it should [1].

I believe the latest rclone updates in 1.68.x should fix this issue, because they handle partial uploads in rclone itself [2].

Re: `rclone gitannex`: I only updated one client to use this, but I've also been careful to never interrupt uploads, so I can't tell. But I don't see how it behaves differently in this regard.
