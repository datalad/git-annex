That's right, I have actually thought before that enough people use it that
it would make sense to either build it in as haskell or ship the program
with git-annex in a kind of contrib.

With that said, there is also something to be said for distributing
maintenance, and I think I'd at least want a committment to maintain it if
it were added to git-annex, since git-annex-remote-rclone already has
ongoing maintenance.

Another angle is [[forum/New_external_special_remote_for_rclone]] which
might see the special remote built into rclone itself, and so able to take
advantage of rclone's internal API. That might supplant the shell script if
it turns out to be better.
