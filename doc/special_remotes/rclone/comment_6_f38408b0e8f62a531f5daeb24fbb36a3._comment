Perhaps Joey can help me out here a bit with some background knowledge:

I've been seeing sporadic corruption with this setup: 

* chunking 
* encryption 
* old helper program git-annex-remote-rclone 
* rclone's pcloud backend

As it seems, rclone keeps partial files under the name of the full file when a transfer is interrupted, for the pcloud backend. (This is for rclone <= 1.67.0; 1.68.0 has changes for pcloud, which may fix this.) My theory how the corruption might have happened:

* First interrupted run of git-annex uploads chunks A and a partial(!) chunk B
* Second run skips chunks A and B(!); and proceedsto upload the rest of the chunks (C and D)
* At the end we have uploaded A, C and D and a corrupted/partial chunk B

Joey: Is this a possible error scenario?
