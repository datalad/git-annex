This is plausible. git-annex requires that special remotes only show a file
as present after a successful upload. If the data store doesn't work that
way, the file needs to be uploaded to a temporary name and renamed
atomically instead. If that's not possible, the data store is not safe for
use by git-annex.

Given all the different types data stores supported by rclone, this may be
difficult, but it's the right thing for the external special remote to do.
I think you should file a bug.

(Does `rclone gitannex` also have this problem?)
