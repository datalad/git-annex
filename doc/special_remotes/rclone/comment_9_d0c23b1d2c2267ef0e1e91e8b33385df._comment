Passing arbitrary parameters to rclone is not supported. It would possibly
be a security hole if it were supported, because if there were a parameter
say --deleteeverything, you could `initremote` a special remote with that 
parameter, and then wait for someone else to `enableremote` and use that 
special remote and have a bad day.

The "*" in `initremote --whatelse` output is a placeholder. It is not
intended to mean that every possible thing is passed through, but that,
if rclone supports some additional parameters, and explicitly asks for
them (via GETCONFIG), they will be passed through to it.

I think that currently, `rclone gitannex` does not request any parameters.
It would certainly be possible to make it support something like
"bwlimit=3000".
