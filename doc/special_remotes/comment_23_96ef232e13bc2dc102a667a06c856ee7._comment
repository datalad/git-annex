I'm using git annex assistant to auto backup my pictures off-site to glacier.  The files in glacier are encrypted.  However, if I lose my main machine, I've also lost the encryption key, which makes my off-site backup useless.  I figured I could fix this by creating a manual mode remote on a usb drive that I keep on my keychain.  I figured this would replicate the encryption key (as I might want to pull down files from the full backup glacier remote), but would not replicate the files themselves, as I have more pictures than space on the usb drive.

However, it seems the that the new remote is configured to only talk to my main machine and not glacier; the encryption key is not in the .git/ directory.  How do I ensure that I've got an off-site copy of the glacier encryption key?

Thanks,
Craig
