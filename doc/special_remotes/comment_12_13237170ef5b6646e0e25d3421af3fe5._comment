Sorry if it is RTFM... If I have multiple original (reachable) remotes, how could I establish my preference for which one to be used in any given location?

usecase: if I clone a repository within amazon cloud instance -- I would now prefer if this (or all -- user-wide configuration somehow?) repository 'get's load from URLs originating in the cloud of this zone (e.g. having us-east-1.s3.amazonaws.com/ in their URLs).
