It would be nice if you could expand the XMPP setup in the assistant to support an \"advanced\" settings view where a custom server could be defined.

Example: I have a google Apps domain called mytest.com, with the users bla1@mytest.com and bla2@mytest.com. When trying to add either of those accounts to the assistant XMPP will try to use mytest.com as the jabber server, and not googles server.
