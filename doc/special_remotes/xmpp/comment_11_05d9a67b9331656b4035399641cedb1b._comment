Hi,

I have the same problem that users Carlo and RaspberryPie have: XMPP not working and no XMPP log in the build.

I did a quick strace during the daemon start and I noticed than the raspberry pi build doesn't even try to read the creds/xmpp files contrary to the standard git-annex package on my ubuntu workstation.

To me, it seems the XMPP thread is not started at all.
Does someone know any reason why the XMPP thread could not be started ?

If there is anything I can do to help debug this issue, let me know.

Yann
