ha -- apparently it is trivial to configure apache to serve pre-compressed files (e.g. see http://stackoverflow.com/questions/75482/how-can-i-pre-compress-files-with-mod-deflate-in-apache-2-x) and they arrive compressed to client with

Content-Encoding: gzip

but unfortunately git-annex doesn't like those (fails to \"verify\") -- do you think it could be implemented for web \"special remotes\"? that would be really nice -- then I could store such load on another website, and addurl links to the compressed content
