I'm trying to write a remote (for smb:// support via GNOME's Gvfs), and I can't seem to find a way to change an existing special remote's parameters?

Even when marked as \"dead\" (the closest to deleting a remote that I could find), it still blocks subsequent `annex initremote` calls with the same name.

Also, ideally I'd want to reuse the same name _and_ keep the same UUID (e.g. when the backend is moved/renamed). Though of course there are situations where a new UUID would be wanted as well... (I guess that could depend on whether the remote is currently \"dead\" or not?)
