Hi Joey,

I am thinking about using google drive as an encrypted backup for my important files. However, I fear that if all my git annex repositories are unrecoverable that the encrypted data on the special remote will not help me much. Assuming I have backed up my gpg key I still get a bunch of decrypted files but the folder structure is lost. Would it be possible to implement something like a safety feature that also uploads an (encrypted) tar of all symlinks (pointing to the respective encrypted files) of the (current/or master-branch) git working tree? 

I am almost sure this is already implementable using hooks however I could not find information on which types of hooks are available. I am looking for one that is triggered once after all copy/move operations to a special remote are finished. Can you point me in the right direction?

Marek
