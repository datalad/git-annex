> it was more flexible to have a more freeform command line, which the compute program parses

agree. And there could be some generic \"helper\" (or a number of them) which would then provide desired CLI interfacing over arbitrary command, smth like (mimicing [datalad-run](https://docs.datalad.org/en/stable/generated/man/datalad-run.html) interface here):

```
git-annex addcomputed --to=runcmd -i foo.jpeg -o foo.gif 
```

as long as we can pass options like that or after `--`, e.g. 

```
git-annex addcomputed --to=runcmd -- -i foo.jpeg -o foo.gif -- convert {inputs} {outputs}`
```

which would then 
- ensure no stdout from `convert`
- follow the *compute special remote interface* to let git-annex know what inputs/outputs were
