`git-annex findcomputed --inputs` is documented to output one line per
input file. If it doesn't behave that way, file a bug.

It would be possible to run git-annex commands in the compute script if
you were able to determine where the git repository was. I don't think
git-annex sets anything in the environment that will help with that
currently.

If the compute program set metadata though, it would re-set the same
metadata when it's used to recompute the files. That might be undesirable
behavior if the user has edited the metadata in the meantime.
