I've realised that... I'm overlooking that the input filename itself is metadata. I have a methodology that I like now.

As per: `git-annex addcomputed --to=imageconvert foo.jpeg foo.gif`, where foo. is linking metadata, I can just generate a filename (and as I've learnt, path), that links back to the source by retaining it.

I also see now that there is no need to avoid duplication of pointer files to the same computed file by key.

The uncomplicated existing approach is more than sufficient.
