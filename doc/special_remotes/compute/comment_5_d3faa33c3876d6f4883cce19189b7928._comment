Absolutely!

You do need to use "--" before your own custom dashed options.

And bear in mind that "field=value" parameters passed to initremote will
be passed on to the program. So you can have a generic helper
that is instantiated with a parameter like --command=, which then gets used
automatically when running addcompute:

	git-annex initremote foo type=compute program=git-annex-compute-generic-helper -- --command='convert {inputs} {outputs}'
	git-annex addcomputed --to=foo -- -i foo.jpeg -o foo.gif
