I'm setting up git-annex with glacier-cli for the first time.  I have installed git-annex via Yum and glacier-cli according to the instructions on Github.  The `glacier` command is in my path.  I did not set up hooks with Git annex as it appears that using hooks for glacier is no longer required.

Here is my version information for git-annex:

	$ git-annex version
	git-annex version: 3.20120523
	local repository version: 3
	default repository version: 3
	supported repository versions: 3
	upgrade supported from repository versions: 0 1 2

When I attempt to add my Glacier remote, here is what I see:

	$ git annex initremote glacier type=glacier keyid=ABCDEFG
	git-annex: Unknown remote type glacier

Is there something else I need to do in order to correctly install Glacier integration with git-annex?  I'm having trouble finding up-to-date information that describes the installation process.
