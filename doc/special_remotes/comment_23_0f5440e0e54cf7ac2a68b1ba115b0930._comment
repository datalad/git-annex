@donkeyicydragon one way to accomplish that would be to just tar up `.git` -- excluding `.git/annex/objects` and add that to git-annex like any other file. You could make a git post-commit hook that does that, but that seems overboard.

Or, you could just make a git clone of your repo to a local removable drive, and use that as a local backup.
