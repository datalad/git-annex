Is there any remote which would not only compress during transfer (I believe rsync does that, right?) but also store objects compressed?

I thought bup would do both -- but it seems that git annex receives data uncompressed from a bup remote, and bup remote requires ssh access.

In my case I want to make publicly available files which are binary blobs which could be compressed very well.  It would be a pity if I waste storage on my end and also incur significant traffic, which could be avoided if data load was transferred compressed.  May be HTTP compression (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_compression) could somehow be used efficiently for this purpose (not sure if load then originally could already reside in a compressed form to avoid server time to re-compress it)?
