Looks like it's not possible to set the annex cost of the \"web\" and \"bittorrent\" special remotes annex cost.

This doesn't seem to work:

[remote \"web\"]
  annex-cost = 500

Perhaps, because these remotes don't actually exist.

Setting annex cost for a webdav remote works but is incremented by 50 for some reason.
