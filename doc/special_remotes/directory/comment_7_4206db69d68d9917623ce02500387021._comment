@nicolas, I suspect you are using `git annex initremote` with the same name that you used for the now dead-and-buried remote. That causes it to be reanimated, which is not what you want.

Since git-annex version 4.20130501, `git annex initremote` is reserved for creating new remotes, not enabling old ones, so it will refuse to do this. That's to avoid exactly this confusion.

Using `git annex initremote` with a different remote name, and the same directory should work just fine.
