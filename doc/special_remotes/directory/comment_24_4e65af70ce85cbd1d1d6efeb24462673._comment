If you exclude them from wanted or gitignore them before ever importing
from the special remote, it won't delete them. But if you already imported
a tree containing the files, and then exclude them, and then export a tree,
git-annex will see that the old tree contained the file, and the new tree
did not, and so will delete the file.
