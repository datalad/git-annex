@dmitry, it just so happens that directory special remotes honor the
annex.diskreserve configuration setting. This normally only applies to
the local git repository, and not to remotes, but since directory
special remotes are local annex.diskreserve is also checked for them.

There's no currently a way to have a different diskreserve setting for
a directory special remote than is used for the local git repository.
