@aslkdjasd this layout is the same as used for .git/annex/objects
in the local repository. 

This allows the FILEKEY directory to have its write bit removed.
This prevents an accidental rm -rf from losing the contents of 
annexed files. Since that might be the only copy of a file,
git-annex adds this extra protection.
