@Laura the directory special remote requires files to
be in a particular directory structure with special names
git-annex comes up with. So you can't use it on an existing
tree of files like that.

What you can do is use the [[web_special_remote|web]],
with a `file://` url to point to the files wherever
they are stored. So for example,
`git annex addurl file:///media/dvd/file`
