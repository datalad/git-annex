I tried the suggestion on comment 4, but when I add again a remote with the same path, it gets the same repository identifier and is considered dead. Is that expected?

My use case: I use a usb drive to transfer some large files from one git annex to another, then I use the usb drive for something else and the special remote is removed.  Later I want to use the same usb drive again, but when I create the repository, it starts in the dead state.
