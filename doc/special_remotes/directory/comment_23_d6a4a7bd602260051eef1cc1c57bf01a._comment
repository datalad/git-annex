Is there a way for git-annex to completely ignore some files on a directory special remote? I'm managing files on my MP3 player's SD card using a directory special remote, but git-annex also tries to manage the player's database files, which I don't want. If I exclude them from wanted or put them in .gitignore, git-annex tries to delete them on sync or export.
