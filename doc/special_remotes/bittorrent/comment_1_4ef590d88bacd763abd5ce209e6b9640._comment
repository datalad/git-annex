I have a multi-file torrent that has been downloaded and annexed. After reading the article about web remote, I thought `git-annex addurl --file` could be used. However, when I tried `git-annex addurl --file video/tvseries/someseries /tmp/some.torrent`, I get the error 

    addurl video/tvseries/someseries git-annex: video/anime/tvseries/someseries already exists and is not annexed; not overwriting

Attaching the torrent to one of the files inside failed, too, with the message:

    addurl video/tvseries/someseries/someepisode.mkv 
    while adding a new url to an already annexed file, failed to verify url exists: /tmp/some.torrent
    failed
    git-annex: addurl: 1 failed
