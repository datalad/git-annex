@craig, all of git-annex's information about a special remote is stored in
the git-annex branch in git, so any clone of the git repository is
sufficient to back that up. You can run `git annex enableremote`
in an clone to enable an existing special remote.

The only catch is that, if you have chosen to initremote a special remote
using a gpg key, with `encryption=shared keyid=whatever`, you'll of course
also need that gpg key to to use it. If you run `git annex info $myremote`
it will tell you amoung other things, any gpg keys that are used by that
remote.
