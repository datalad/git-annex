git-annex can use the web as a special remote, associating an url with an
annexed file, and downloading the file content from the web.
See [[tips/using_the_web_as_a_special_remote]] for usage examples.

The web special remote is always enabled, without any manual setup being
needed. Its name is "web".

This special remote can only be used for downloading content,
not uploading content, or removing content from the web.

This special remote uses urls on the web as the source for content.
There are several other ways http can be used to download annexed objects,
including a git remote accessible by http, S3 with a `publicurl` configured,
and the [[httpalso]] special remote.
