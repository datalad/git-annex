git-annex can use the WWW as a special remote, downloading urls to files.
See [[tips/using_the_web_as_a_special_remote]] for usage examples.

## notes

Currently git-annex only supports downloading content from the web; 
it cannot upload to it or remove content.

This special remote uses arbitrary urls on the web as the source for content.
git-annex can also download content from a normal git remote, accessible by
http.
