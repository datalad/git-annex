Hi,

I've been unable to setup a remote in Beijing (region cn-north-1) as the signature request type doesn't seem to be V4

MacBook-Pro:gitannex-china iwatson$ git annex initremote ings3cn bucket=\"testbec\" type=S3 chunk=50MiB encryption=none datacenter=\"cn-north-1\"
initremote ings3cn (checking bucket...) (creating bucket in cn-north-1...) git-annex: FailedConnectionException2 \"testbec.s3-cn-north-1.amazonaws.com\" 80 False getAddrInfo: does not exist (nodename nor servname provided, or not known)

The endpoints for china default to \"testbec.s3-cn-north-1.amazonaws.com\" but should be \"s3.cn-north-1.amazonaws.com.cn\". Using host option I can set this:
MacBook-Pro:gitannex-china iwatson$ git annex initremote ings3cn bucket=\"testbec\" type=S3 chunk=50MiB encryption=none host=\"s3.cn-north-1.amazonaws.com.cn\" datacenter=\"cn-north-1\"
initremote ings3cn (checking bucket...) (creating bucket in cn-north-1...) git-annex: S3Error {s3StatusCode = Status {statusCode = 400, statusMessage = \"Bad Request\"}, s3ErrorCode = \"InvalidRequest\", s3ErrorMessage = \"The authorization mechanism you have provided is not supported. Please use AWS4-HMAC-SHA256.\", s3ErrorResource = Nothing, s3ErrorHostId = Just \"xpA26oUbKWQMsDLG8GDceSbXOZKn8KIaV8OKdl+75+4rCMor3Gp4GY9ycSIxfP/owemTijcNYAY=\", s3ErrorAccessKeyId = Nothing, s3ErrorStringToSign = Nothing, s3ErrorBucket = Nothing, s3ErrorEndpointRaw = Nothing, s3ErrorEndpoint = Nothing}

However, the message is that the authorization mechanism isn't AWS4-HMAC-SHA256 - if you see AWS this is V4 required by china and all new AWS regions:
http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html

Is there anyway you can update the S3 remotes to use the new V4 signature method so git annex will work with china AWS?

Thanks :)
