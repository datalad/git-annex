I guess this could be useful if you have a *lot* of buckets already in use at S3, or if you want to be able to have a lot of distinct S3 special remotes. Implemented the `fileprefix` setting. Note that I have not tested it, beyond checking it builds, since I let my S3 account expire. Your testing would be appreciated.
