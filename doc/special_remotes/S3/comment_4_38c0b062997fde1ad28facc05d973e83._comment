it'd be really nice being able to configure a S3 remote of the form `<bucket>/<folder>` (not really a folder, of course, just the usual prefix trick used to simulate folders at S3). The remote = bucket architecture is not scalable at all, in terms of number of repositories.

how hard would it be to support this?

thanks, this is the only thing that's holding us back from using git-annex, nice tool!
