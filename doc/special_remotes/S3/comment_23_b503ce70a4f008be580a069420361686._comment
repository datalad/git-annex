@tim, are the git-annex repositories going to be connected? If so,
`git-annex initremote` the S3 remote to one, merge it into the next
repo, and then `git annex enableremote` the S3 remote there.

That's the sane way. If you want for some reason to have multiple separate
git-annex repositories, that all try to use the same S3 bucket, without
knowing about one-another, I have to recommend against it. You're setting
yourself up to shoot yourself in the foot, and quite possibly lose data.

While you can `git annex enableremote` the same bucket repeatedly in the
different repositories, each time it will be given a different uuid, and
since the uuid is stored in the bucket, this will prevent `git annex
enableremote` from being used for the old uuid, since it will see the
bucket has a different uuid now.
