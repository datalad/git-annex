(My own question, answered by Use The Source Luke method)

If you need to point a `type=S3` special remote at a service which provides only https (in my case, a local CEPH RADOS gateway) then you can do it by setting `port=443`.

This was implemented in 6fcca2f1 and next tag was 5.20141203 .  On Ubuntu, that version is available in Xenial but not Trusty.
