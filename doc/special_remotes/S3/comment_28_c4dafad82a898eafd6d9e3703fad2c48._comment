I'd like to reiterate a question that was unanswered above:

Is there a way to tell the S3 backend to store the files as they are named locally, instead of by hashed content name? i.e., I've annexed foo/bar.txt and annex puts it in s3 as mybucket.name/foo/bar.txt instead of mybucket.name/GPGHMACSHA1-random.txt
