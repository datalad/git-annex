@darkfeline I suppose you're talking about two completely disjoint git
repositories, and not two clones of the same parent repo.

If you don't use fileprefix, and have the same file in two disjoint
repositories, git-annex will pick the same key for it in both cases, and
so you'll get deduplication, but only if you don't use different
fileprefixes.

And this will mostly work pretty well. The danger is, if you drop the file
from the S3 repo, because say, it's not used anymore in one repository,
then you're also removing it from the S3 repo as used by the other
repository. If that was the last copy of the file, that may not be what you
want.
