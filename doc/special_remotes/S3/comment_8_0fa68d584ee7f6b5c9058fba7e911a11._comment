If encryption is not used, the files are stored in S3 as-is, and can be accessed directly. They are stored in a hashed directory structure with the names of their key used, rather than the original filename. To get back to the original filename, a copy of the git repo would also be needed.

With encryption, you need the gpg key used in the encryption, or, for shared encryption, a symmetric key which is stored in the git repo.

See [[future proofing]] for non-S3 specific discussion of this topic.
