You can enable a special remote on a clone by running `git annex enableremote $name`, where $name is the name you used to originally create the special remote. (Older versions of git-annex used `git annex initremote` to enable the special remote on the clone.)

(Just in case, I have verified that embedcreds does cause the cipher= to be stored in the remote.log. It does.)
