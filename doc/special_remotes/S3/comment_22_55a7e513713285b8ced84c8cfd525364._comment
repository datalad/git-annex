I was hoping to use the same bucket for multiple repo's (100+) with a lot of files in common. Dropping unused files would not be an issue for me, so from what I read above this should be possible.
However I cannot get initremote nor enableremote to add a repo with an existing uuid. How do I add an already initialized bucket to a new git annex repo?
