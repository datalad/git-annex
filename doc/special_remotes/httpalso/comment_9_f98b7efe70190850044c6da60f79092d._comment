Hi @Joey,
I was wondering if it would be possible to setup the dirhash format for the special remote.

We push data to a datalad ria-store through ssh that gets RO accessed through a httpalso remote.
However, I observe that get operations try different directory hashing schema before hitting the right one that datalad ORA remote uses.
This is also the case when doing repo-wide `fsck` in recurring tests of the dataset. 
All of that is doubling the number of http request, and could in some setups trigger fail2ban-type mechanisms at network or server levels.
If there was a parameter that could be set on the httpalso to directly use the right URLs, that would be great.

Thanks!
