@davidriod if you're using a rsyncurl that uses ssh, then yes, the
transmission goes over a secure connection. If the rsyncurl uses
the rsync protocol, there would be no encryption.

Of course, encryption=none does not keep the data encrypted at rest,
so the admin of the rsync server can see it etc.
