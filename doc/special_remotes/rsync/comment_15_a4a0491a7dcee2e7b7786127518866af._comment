@davidriod you can do things like this with special remotes, as long
as the special remotes are not encrypted.

I don't really recommend it. With such a shared special remote R and two
disconnected git repos -- call them A and B, some confusing situations can
occur. For example, the only copies of some files may be 
on special remote R and git repo B. A knows about the copy in R, so 
git-annex is satisfied there is one copy of the file. But now, B can drop
the content from R, which is allowed as the content is in B. A is then left
unable to recover the content of the files at all, since they have been
removed from R.

Better to connect the two repositories A and B, even if you do work in
two separate branches. Then if a file ends up located only on B, A will be
able to say where it is, and could even get it from B (if B was set up as a
remote).
