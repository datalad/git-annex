Hi, I would like to see a example of setting up / using e.g. rsync.net as a repo.


Please also provide a highlevel description of how the rsync repo fits in with git-annex.

 
Q1. can you adds files to the remote rsync repo, and will they be detected and synced back ?
Q2. is all the git history rsync'd to remote ?   how do i recover if i loose all data except the remote rsync repo ?
