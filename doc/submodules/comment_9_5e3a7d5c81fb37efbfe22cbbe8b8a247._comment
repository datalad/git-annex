Datalad relies on git-annex's handling of submodules to work afaik so I
don't see why using it would avoid this problem.

If I understand correctly, the .git symlink in the submodule that git-annex
sets up gets broken when the submodule is relocated. But I would have
expected that moving from `a/b/` to `x/y/` would keep the symlink working,
since it's at the same path depth.

I'd need more information to fix this problem, so I recommend filing a
[[bugs|bug]] report with details.
