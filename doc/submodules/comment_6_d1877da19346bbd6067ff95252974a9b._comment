Since git 1.8.5, `git mv projects/2023/prj_1 archives/2023/prj_1` can update local path of submodule.
Currently, `git-annex` doesn't detect submodule path changed and Just moving parent directories breaks git-modules thoroughly.
The only way I found is to move all submodule to another tree structure one by one using `git mv ...`.

If the parent directory name(e.g: projects->01_Projects) or its depth was changed by chance, all submodules inside the directory are broken.

So I cannot use submodules to handle source code in my git-annex repo.
Is there an easy (cool) way for this?
