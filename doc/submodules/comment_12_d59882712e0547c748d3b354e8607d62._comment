I agree with you. Specifically, [this](https://git-annex.branchable.com/todo/detect_and_handle_submodules_after_path_changed_by_mv/) is related to git, not git-annex.

I wanted to run `git annex assist` just and expect to be fixed.

I wrote a simple python script to fix the issue, which changed the path of the submodule. And by adding the script in pre-commit hook, I can do `git annex assist` now without fixing the submodules manually.
(I used python to manipulate the text files such as dot-gitmodules etc. Perl or Ruby would be much compact in this job.)

It seems to work well for my needs, even though just a prototype script. 

After some polishing (and testing), I'll upload the script here.

Thank you.
