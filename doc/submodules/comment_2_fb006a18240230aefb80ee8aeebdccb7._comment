The submodule .git file having been converted to a symlink is still a problem when using `git checkout` with `--recurse-submodules` in the parent repo. The previous poster's solution to use `git checkout mybranch && git submodule update` does not work with git version 2.40.0 and git-annex version 10.20230407. 

Are there other suggestions for workarounds?

The original post states that the .git as a symlink fixes problems that exist for a .git file which points to the `.git/modules/` folder of the parent. What problems are these problems?
