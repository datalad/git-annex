@TTTTAAAx kindly posted a full example of their problem, 
which I've moved to 
[[todo/detect_and_handle_submodules_after_path_changed_by_mv]].

I do think that using `git mv` to rename directories that contain
submodules is the right way to avoid that kind of problem. 
Note that renaming such a directory without using git followed by running
`git add` on the new directory has the same behavior as running
`git-annex assist` does. This is not a git-annex problem, but I think it
could be considered a git problem; git could make `git add` of a moved
submodule do the right thing.
