> Sounds like you might want to use datalad, which is built around git annex and where submodules are a first-class citizen. 

Datalad handles submodules as subdatasets and add python code layers on it to handle datasets(e.g. dedup submodules). But it doesn't detect the submodules path changed like git.

So, it doesn't do my needs sadly.
