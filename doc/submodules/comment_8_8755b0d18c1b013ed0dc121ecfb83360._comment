> Sounds like you might want to use datalad, which is built around git annex and where submodules are a first-class citizen. 

Thank you for information. I'll try datalad. I considered it for audio and transcription dataset management few years ago. But I didn't use it because datalad using git-annex in it and I already used git-annex for data management. It was seemd to be redundant to me.

I think submodule path detecting can be implemented still and be useful in `git-annex-assist` also.
