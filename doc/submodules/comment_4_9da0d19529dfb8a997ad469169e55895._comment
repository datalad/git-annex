I might have this wrong, but I thought git also put things into `$repo/.git/...`? If git can figure out that the `.git` file points to the actual location of the `.git` folder (in the parent repo) than I would think that git annex can conclude this as well. Again, I don't know how the guts of git annex works, so there is possibly other considerations that I am missing.
