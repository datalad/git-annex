git-annex 10.20240701 released with [[!toggle text="these changes"]]
[[!toggleable text="""  * git-annex remotes can now act as proxies that provide access to
    their remotes. Configure this with remote.name.annex-proxy
    and the git-annex update proxy command.
  * Clusters are now supported. These are collections of nodes that can
    be accessed as a single entity, accessed by one or more gateway
    repositories.
  * Added git-annex initcluster, updatecluster, and extendcluster commands.
  * Fix a bug where interrupting git-annex while it is updating the
    git-annex branch for an export could later lead to git fsck
    complaining about missing tree objects.
  * Tab completion of options like --from now includes special remotes,
    as well as proxied remotes and clusters.
  * Tab completion of many commands like info and trust now includes
    remotes.
  * P2P protocol version 2.
  * Fix Windows build with Win32 2.13.4+
    Thanks, Oleg Tolmatcev
  * When --debugfilter or annex.debugfilter is set, avoid propigating
    debug output from git-annex-shell, since it cannot be filtered."""]]
