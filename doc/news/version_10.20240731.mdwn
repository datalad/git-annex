git-annex 10.20240731 released with [[!toggle text="these changes"]]
[[!toggleable text="""  * New HTTP API that is equivilant to the P2P protocol.
  * New p2phttp command to serve the HTTP API.
  * annex+http and annex+https urls can be configured for
    remote.name.annexUrl to use the HTTP API to communicate with a server.
    This supports writable repositories, as well as accessing clusters
    and proxied remotes over HTTP.
  * When a http remote has annex.url set to an annex+http url in
    the git config file on the website, it will be copied into
    remote.name.annexUrl the first time git-annex uses the remote.
  * assistant: Fix a race condition that could cause a pointer file to
    get ingested into the annex.
  * Avoid potential data loss in unlikely situations where git-annex-shell
    or git-annex remotedaemon is killed while locking a key to prevent its
    removal.
  * When proxying a download from a special remote, avoid unncessary hashing.
  * When proxying an upload to a special remote, verify the hash.
  * Propagate --force to git-annex transferrer.
  * Added a build flag for servant, enabling annex+http urls and
    git-annex p2phttp.
  * Added a dependency on the haskell clock library.
  * Updated stack.yaml to nightly-2024-07-29."""]]
