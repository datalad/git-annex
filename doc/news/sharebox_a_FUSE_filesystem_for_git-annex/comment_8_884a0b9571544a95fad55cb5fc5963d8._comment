Thanks for doing it and asking for detail!!!
Repositories will vary quite a bit.  I am currently testing how big we could actually make them (see https://github.com/datalad/datalad/issues/17) ;)

Meanwhile here are sample few available for git clone/testing:

https://github.com/datalad/nih--videocast   a good collection of heavyish video files
http://psydata.ovgu.de/forrest_gump/.git/   a good single dataset with probably a somewhat typical amount of data
http://data.pymvpa.org/datasets/haxby2001/.git/  relatively small dataset with typical data sizes
