Having the lean view would be easy to implement either as an option you pass when mounting or something you can toggle by touching a file ($MNT/.config/lean/{on,off}).

Regarding fetching of files, how would you like it to behave? My previous one would return EBUSY while downloading a file and ENODATA if it wasn't available and couldn't be fetched. I could, for example, make unavailable files appear as normal files (containing text regarding the download state) until they are available, then they become symlinks. What would work best for you?
