My concern about using FUSE has always been that I don't much like it
when open() hangs indefinitely, with no progress indication, and 
is either downloading some large file from the network or .. just hung.

That doesn't strike me as a nice user interface in general,
which is why I avoided using FUSE for the assistant.

It might make sense in the batch use cases Yaroslav gave. If something
nice is developed, I would not be against including it in git-annex.
(Bonus if it's implemented in haskell.)
