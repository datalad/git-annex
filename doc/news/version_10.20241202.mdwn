git-annex 10.20241202 released with [[!toggle text="these changes"]]
[[!toggleable text="""  * add: Consistently treat files in a dotdir as dotfiles, even
    when ran inside that dotdir.
  * add: When adding a dotfile as a non-large file, mention that it's a
    dotfile.
  * p2phttp: Added --directory option which serves multiple git-annex
    repositories located inside a directory.
  * When remote.name.annexUrl is an annex+http(s) url, that
    uses the same hostname as remote.name.url, which is itself a http(s)
    url, they are assumed to share a username and password. This avoids
    unnecessary duplicate password prompts.
  * git-remote-annex: Fix a reversion introduced in version 10.20241031
    that broke cloning from a special remote.
  * git-remote-annex: Fix cloning from a special remote on a crippled
    filesystem.
  * git-remote-annex: Fix buggy behavior when annex.stalldetection is

    ones had a buggy git bundle command.

    (Needs aws-0.24.3)
  * S3: Send git-annex or other configured User-Agent.
    (Needs aws-0.24.3)
  * S3: Fix infinite loop and memory blowup when importing from an
    unversioned S3 bucket that is large enough to need pagination.

    versioned S3 bucket.
  * vpop: Only update state after successful checkout."""]]
