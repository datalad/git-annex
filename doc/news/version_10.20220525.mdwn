git-annex 10.20220525 released with [[!toggle text="these changes"]]
[[!toggleable text="""  * Special remotes with importtree=yes or exporttree=yes are once again
    treated as untrusted, since files stored in them can be deleted or
    modified at any time.
    (Fixes a reversion in 8.20201129)
  * Added support for "megabit" and related bandwidth units
    in annex.stalldetection and everywhere else that git-annex parses
    data units. Note that the short form is "Mbit" not "Mb" because
    that differs from "MB" only in case, and git-annex parses units
    case-insensitively.
  * Special remotes using exporttree=yes and/or importtree=yes now
    checksum content while it is being retrieved, instead of in a separate
    pass at the end.
  * fsck: Fix situations where the annex object file is stored in a
    directory structure other than where annex symlinks point to.
  * Deal with git's recent changes to fix CVE-2022-24765, which prevent
    using git in a repository owned by someone else.
  * Improve an error message displayed in that situation.
  * Prevent git-annex init incorrectly reinitializing the repository in
    that situation.
  * test: When limiting tests to run with -p, work around tasty limitation
    by automatically including dependent tests."""]]
