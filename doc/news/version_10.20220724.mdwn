git-annex 10.20220724 released with [[!toggle text="these changes"]]
[[!toggleable text="""  * filter-process: Fix a bug involving handling of empty files,
    that caused git to kill git-annex filter-process.
  * add: Fix reversion when adding an annex link that has been moved to
    another directory. (Introduced in version 10.20220624)
  * Added annex.alwayscompact setting which can be unset to speed up
    writes to the git-annex branch in some cases. See its documentation
    for important notes on when it's appropariate to use.
  * adb: Added configuration setting oldandroid=true to avoid using
    find -printf, which was first supported in Android around 2019-2020.
    This may need to be enabled for old android devices that used to work
    without it being set, since version 10.20220222 started using
    find -printf.
  * --backend is no longer a global option, and is only accepted by
    commands that actually need it.
  * Improve handling of parallelization with -J when copying content
    from/to a git remote that is a local path.
  * S3: Avoid writing or checking the uuid file in the S3 bucket when
    importtree=yes or exporttree=yes.
  * Fix a reversion that prevented --batch commands (and the assistant)
    from noticing data written to the journal by other commands.
  * Fix building with the Assistant build flag disabled but the Webapp
    build flag enabled."""]]
