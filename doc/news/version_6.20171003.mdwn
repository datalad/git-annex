git-annex 6.20171003 released with [[!toggle text="these changes"]]
[[!toggleable text="""
   * webdav: Improve error message for failed request to include the request
     method and path.
   * metadata: Added --remove-all.
   * Warn when metadata is inherited from a previous version of a file,
     to avoid the user being surprised in cases where that behavior is not
     desired or expected.
   * sync: Added --cleanup, which removes local and remote synced/ branches.
   * external: When the external special remote program crashed, a newline
     could be output, which messed up the expected output for --batch mode.
   * external: Avoid checking EXPORTSUPPORTED for special remotes that are
     not configured to use exports.
   * test: Fix reversion that made it only run inside a git repository.
   * copy, move: Behave same with --fast when sending to remotes located
     on a local disk as when sending to other remotes.
   * Fix process and file descriptor leak that was exposed when
     git-annex was built with ghc 8.2.1. Broke git-annex test on OSX
     due to running out of FDs, and may have also leaked in other situations.
   * info: Improve cleanup of stale transfer info files."""]]
