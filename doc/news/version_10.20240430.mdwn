git-annex 10.20240430 released with [[!toggle text="these changes"]]
[[!toggleable text="""  * Bug fix: While redundant concurrent transfers were already
    prevented in most cases, it failed to prevent the case where
    two different repositories were sending the same content to
    the same repository.
  * addurl, importfeed: Added --verifiable option, which improves
    the safety of --fast or --relaxed by letting the content of
    annexed files be verified with a checksum that is calculated
    on a later download from the web. This will become the default later.
  * Added rclone special remote, which can be used without needing
    to install the git-annex-remote-rclone program. This needs
    a forthcoming version of rclone (1.67.0), which supports
    "rclone gitannex".
  * sync, assist, import: Allow -m option to be specified multiple
    times, to provide additional paragraphs for the commit message.
  * reregisterurl: New command that can change an url from being
    used by a special remote to being used by the web remote.
  * annex.maxextensions configuration controls how many filename
    extensions to preserve.
  * find: Fix --help for --copies.
    Thanks, Gergely Risko
  * Windows: Fix escaping output to terminal when using old
    versions of MinTTY.
  * Added dependency on unbounded-delays."""]]
