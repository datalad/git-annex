git-annex 6.20161210 released with [[!toggle text="these changes"]]
[[!toggleable text="""
   * enable-tor: New command, enables tor hidden service for P2P syncing.
   * p2p: New command, allows linking repositories using a P2P network.
   * remotedaemon: Serve tor hidden service.
   * Added git-remote-tor-annex, which allows git pull and push to the tor
     hidden service.
   * remotedaemon: Fork to background by default. Added --foreground switch
     to enable old behavior.
   * addurl: Fix bug in checking annex.largefiles expressions using
     largerthan, mimetype, and smallerthan; the first two always failed
     to match, and the latter always matched.
   * Relicense 5 source files that are not part of the webapp from AGPL to GPL.
   * map: Run xdot if it's available in PATH. On OSX, the dot command
     does not support graphical display, while xdot does.
   * Debian: xdot is a better interactive viewer than dot, so Suggest
     xdot, rather than graphviz.
   * rmurl: Multiple pairs of files and urls can be provided on the
     command line.
   * rmurl: Added --batch mode.
   * fromkey: Accept multiple pairs of files and keys.
     Thanks, Daniel Brooks.
   * rekey: Added --batch mode.
   * add: Stage modified non-large files when running in indirect mode.
     (This was already done in v6 mode and direct mode.)
   * git-annex-shell, remotedaemon, git remote: Fix some memory DOS attacks.
   * Fix build with http-client 0.5.
     Thanks, Alper Nebi Yasak."""]]
