  * Copy with a reflink when exporting a tree to a directory special remote.
  * Fix bug that caused broken protocol to be used with external remotes
    that use exporttree=yes. In some cases this could result in the wrong
    content being exported to, or retrieved from the remote.
  * Support VERSION 2 in the external special remote protocol, which is
    identical to VERSION 1, but avoids external remote programs neededing
    to work around the above bug. External remote program that support
    exporttree=yes are recommended to be updated to send VERSION 2."""]]
