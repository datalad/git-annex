We are happy to announce that the call for participation for the first ever
Distribits meeting is now online at <https://distribits.live/>

This meeting is organized by the folks behind git-annex and DataLad. We aim
to bring together enthusiasts of tools and workflows in the domain of
distributed data.

We are looking forward to April 2024 and to meeting people from everywhere,
online and in DÃ¼sseldorf.

Registration is open now and until October 15. Please consider submitting a
talk if you are doing something interesting or unusual with git-annex.
