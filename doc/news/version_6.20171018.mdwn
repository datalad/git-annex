   * add: Replace work tree file atomically on systems supporting hard
     links. Avoids a window where interrupting an add could result in
     the file being moved into the annex, with no symlink yet created.
   * webdav: Avoid unncessisarily creating the collection at the top
     of the repository when storing files there, since that collection
     is created by initremote.
     (This seems to work around some brokenness of the box.com webdav
     server, which caused uploads to be very slow or sometimes fail.)
   * webdav: Make --debug show all webdav operations.
   * get -J/move -J/copy -J/mirror -J/sync -J: Avoid "transfer already in
     progress" errors when two files use the same key.
   * Konqueror desktop file location changed to one used by plasma 5.
     Thanks, FÃ©lix Sipma.
   * Avoid repeated checking that files passed on the command line exist.
   * Fix build with aws-0.17.
   * stack.yaml: Update to lts-9.9."""]]
