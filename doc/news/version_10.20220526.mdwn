git-annex 10.20220526 released with [[!toggle text="these changes"]]
[[!toggleable text="""  * init: Added --no-autoenable option.
  * info: Added --autoenable option.
  * initremote: Improve handling of type=git special remotes.
    The location value no longer needs to match the url of an existing
    git remote, and locations not using ssh:// will work now, including
    both paths and host:/path
  * Fix retrival of an empty file that is stored in a special remote with
    chunking enabled.
    (Fixes a reversion in 8.20201103)
  * move: Improve resuming a move that succeeded in transferring the
    content, but where dropping failed due to eg a network problem,
    in cases where numcopies checks prevented the resumed
    move from dropping the object from the source repository.
  * add, fix, lock, rekey: When several files were being processed,
    replacing an annex symlink of a file that was already processed
    with a new large file could sometimes cause that large file to be
    added to git. These races have been fixed.
  * add: Also fix a similar race that could cause a large file be added
    to git when a small file was modified or overwritten while it was
    being added.
  * add --batch: Fix handling of a file that is skipped due to being
    gitignored."""]]
