git-annex 6.20171026 released with [[!toggle text="these changes"]]
[[!toggleable text="""
   * Windows: Fix reversion that caused the path used to link
     to annexed content to include the drive letter and full path, rather
     than being relative. (`git annex fix` will fix up after this problem).
   * Windows build fixed, and changed to use stack for more reliable build
     environment.
   * Windows: Remove wget from bundle; it needs libraries that are not
     included, and git for windows includes curl which git-annex will use
     instead.
   * Add day to metadata when annex.genmetadata is enabled.
     Thanks, Sean T Parsons
   * stack.yaml: Added nix packages section.
     Thanks, Sean T Parsons"""]]
