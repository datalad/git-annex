git-annex 10.20250320 released with [[!toggle text="these changes"]]
[[!toggleable text="""  * Added the compute special remote.
  * addcomputed: New command, adds a file that is generated by a compute
    special remote.
  * recompute: New command, recomputes computed files.
  * findcomputed: New command, displays information about computed files.
  * Support help.autocorrect settings "prompt", "never", and "immediate".
  * Allow setting remote.foo.annex-tracking-branch to a branch name
    that contains "/", as long as it's not a remote tracking branch.
  * Added OsPath build flag, which speeds up git-annex's operations on files.
  * git-lfs: Added an optional apiurl parameter.
    (This needs version 1.2.5 of the haskell git-lfs library to be used.)
  * fsck: Remember the files that are checked, so a later run with --more
    will skip them, without needing to use --incremental."""]]
