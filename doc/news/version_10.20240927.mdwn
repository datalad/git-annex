    which would lead to repeatedly getting and then dropping files,

    "not balanced" and "not sizebalanced".
  * Fix --explain display of onlyingroup preferred content expression.
  * Allow maxsize to be set to 0 to stop checking maxsize for a repository.
  * Fix bug that prevented anything being stored in an empty
    repository whose preferred content expression uses sizebalanced.
