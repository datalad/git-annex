[[!meta title="sharebox: a FUSE filesystem for git-annex"]]

Christophe-Marie Duquesne has just announced 
[Sharebox](https://github.com/chmduquesne/sharebox-fs), a FUSE filesystem
relying on git-annex:

<blockquote>
<pre>
What are your goals?  
Seamless synchronization "Ã  la dropbox".  
Ability to use with big binary files such as mp3/movies.  
Entirely decentralized.  
Don't use unnecessary space  
Keep it simple: avoid special VCS commands and keep a filesystem  
interface as much as possible.
</pre>
</blockquote>

While still alpha, this is promising. --[[Joey]]
