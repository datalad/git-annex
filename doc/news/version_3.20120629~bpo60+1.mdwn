   * cabal: Only try to use inotify on Linux.
   * Version build dependency on STM, and allow building without it,
     which disables the watch command.
   * Note: watch command is disabled in this backport.
   * Avoid ugly failure mode when moving content from a local repository
     that is not available.
   * Got rid of the last place that did utf8 decoding.
   * Accept arbitrarily encoded repository filepaths etc when reading
     git config output. This fixes support for remotes with unusual characters
     in their names.
   * sync: Automatically resolves merge conflicts."""]]
