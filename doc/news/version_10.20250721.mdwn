git-annex 10.20250721 released with [[!toggle text="these changes"]]
[[!toggleable text="""  * Improved workaround for git 2.50 bug, avoding an occasional test suite
    failure, as well as some situations where an unlocked file did not get
    populated when adding another file to the repository with the same
    content.
  * Add --url option and url= preferred content expression, to match
    content that is recorded as present in an url.
  * p2phttp: Scan multilevel directories with --directory.
  * p2phttp: Added --socket option.
  * Fix bug in handling of linked worktrees on filesystems not supporting
    symlinks, that caused annexed file content to be stored in the wrong
    location inside the git directory, and also caused pointer files to not
    get populated.
  * fsck: Fix location of annexed files when run in linked worktrees
    that have experienced the above bug.
  * Fix symlinks generated to annexed content when in adjusted unlocked
    branch in a linked worktree on a filesystem not supporting symlinks."""]]
