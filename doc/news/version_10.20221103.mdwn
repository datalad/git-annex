git-annex 10.20221103 released with [[!toggle text="these changes"]]
[[!toggleable text="""  * Doubled the speed of git-annex drop when operating on many files,
    and of git-annex get when operating on many tiny files.
  * trust, untrust, semitrust, dead: Fix behavior when provided with
    multiple repositories to operate on.
  * trust, untrust, semitrust, dead: When provided with no parameters,
    do not operate on a repository that has an empty name.
  * move: Fix openFile crash with -J
    (Fixes a reversion in 8.20201103)
  * S3: Speed up importing from a large bucket when fileprefix= is set,
    by only asking for files under the prefix.
  * When importing from versioned remotes, fix tracking of the content
    of deleted files.
  * More robust handling of ErrorBusy when writing to sqlite databases.
  * Avoid hanging when a suspended git-annex process is keeping a sqlite
    database locked.
  * Make --batch mode handle unstaged annexed files consistently
    whether the file is unlocked or not. Note that this changes the
    behavior of --batch when it is provided with locked files that are
    in the process of being added to the repository, but have not yet been
    staged in git.
  * Make git-annex enable-tor work when using the linux standalone build."""]]
