git-annex 10.20250102 released with [[!toggle text="these changes"]]
[[!toggleable text="""  * Added config `url.&lt;base&gt;.annexInsteadOf` corresponding to git's
    `url.&lt;base&gt;.pushInsteadOf`, to configure the urls to use for accessing
    the git-annex repositories on a server without needing to configure
    remote.name.annexUrl in each repository.
  * Work around git hash-object --stdin-paths's odd stripping of carriage
    return from the end of the line (some windows infection), avoiding
    crashing when the repo contains a filename ending in a carriage return.
  * Document that settting preferred content to "" is the same as the
    default unset behavior.
  * sync: Avoid misleading warning about future preferred content
    transition when preferred content is set to "".
  * Honor annex.addunlocked configuration when importing a tree from a
    special remote.
  * Removed the i386ancient standalone tarball build for linux, which
    was increasingly unable to support new git-annex features.
  * Removed support for building with ghc older than 9.0.2,
    and with older versions of haskell libraries than are in current Debian
    stable.
  * stack.yaml: Update to lts-23.2."""]]
