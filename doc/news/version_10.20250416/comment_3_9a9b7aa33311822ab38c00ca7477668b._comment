Hi,

So to resolve the .DS_Store issue, I just had to go into the .git repo and remove all the .DS_Store files that MacOS littered around.

To fix the repo itself, I ended up doing a `git fetch goodremote` and this seems to have fixed the issue.
I can now run `git annex info` again without a problem.

The weird thing is, it was complaining about `uuid.log`, however, when running `git show git-annex:uuid.log` I was getting the same output on both repos.
It's not clear what went wrong. Maybe corruption but `git fsck` never showed an issue. Fetching from a good repo seems to have fixed it.

Hopefully this helps if anyone has a similar problem.

Liam
