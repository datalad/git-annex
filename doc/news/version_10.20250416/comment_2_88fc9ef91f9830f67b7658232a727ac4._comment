Hi,

As follow on from the above, I'm trying to repair the repo using the built-in tool from here: [[https://git-annex.branchable.com/git-annex-repair/]]
However, it seems to have problems on MacOS.

```
$ git annex repair
repair  Running git fsck ...

^C
```

Somethings gone quite wrong if those .DS_Store files are showing up there.

I'd love to dig into the source for git-annex but I don't know Haskell...
Maybe this is a sign I should learn it?

The `uuid.log` problem in my previous post seems to have a bit of documentation here: [[https://git-annex.branchable.com/internals/]]
Maybe it has something to do with a previously failed clone attempt? I will dig some more tomorrow.
