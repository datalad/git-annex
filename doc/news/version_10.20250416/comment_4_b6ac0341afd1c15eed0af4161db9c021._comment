First of all, a news item for a release is not the appropriate place to
discuss something like this. Use the [[forum]] in the furture.

This looks like a `.git/annex/index` that references a git object that for
some reason didn't get written to disk. A common way this can happen is a
disk getting unmounted or system shutdown at a point in time that causes a
recently written git object to get lost. Deleting `.git/annex/index` will
solve this problem.
