git-annex 10.20240531 released with [[!toggle text="these changes"]]
[[!toggleable text="""  * git-remote-annex: New program which allows pushing a git repo to a
    git-annex special remote, and cloning from a special remote.
    (Based on Michael Hanke's git-remote-datalad-annex.)
  * initremote, enableremote: Added --with-url to enable using
    git-remote-annex.
  * When building an adjusted unlocked branch, make pointer files
    executable when the annex object file is executable.
  * group: Added --list option.
  * fsck: Fix recent reversion that made it say it was checksumming files
    whose content is not present.
  * Avoid the --fast option preventing checksumming in some cases it
    was not supposed to.
  * testremote: Really fsck downloaded objects.
  * Typo fixes.
    Thanks, Yaroslav Halchenko"""]]
