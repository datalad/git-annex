Thanks to my recent successful git-annex
[crowdfunding campaign](http://campaign.joeyh.name/), $1000 has been set
aside to award others for their contributions to git-annex by
the end of 2013. This is not a lot of money, but I hope that the
reward and recognition will encourage some more people to work on git-annex.

You don't need to know Haskell! You could contribute some interesting and
useful special remote hooks, or write better documentation.

On the other hand, if you have learned Haskell, this might be your first
chance to make some money with it! Some ideas for things to work on that
would be particularly award-worthy:

* Port git-annex to IOS, using [ghc-ios](https://github.com/ghc-ios).
  I don't plan to ever do this myself, but you could make it happen.
* Get the git-annex assistant working in Windows, building on the existing
  port to Windows. Otherwise, this is on my roadmap for February.
* Solve existing [[bugs]] or [[todo]] items. There are more than I can
  keep up with.

The amount of the awards will vary depending on the size of the
contribution. Since this is getting started later than is ideal,
I reserve the right to extend it past the end of the year if I don't get
enough participants.

If you'd like to participate in this program, just email me at
<id@joeyh.name>. --[[Joey]]
