git-annex 10.20250605 released with [[!toggle text="these changes"]]
[[!toggleable text="""  * sync: Push the current branch first, rather than a synced branch,
    to better support git forges (gitlab, gitea, forgejo, etc.) which
    use push-to-create with the first pushed branch becoming the default
    branch.
  * Added annex.fastcopy and remote.name.annex-fastcopy config setting.
    When set, this allows the copy\_file\_range syscall to be used, which
    can eg allow for server-side copies on NFS. (For fastest copying,
    also disable annex.verify or remote.name.annex-verify.)
  * map: Support --json option.
  * map: Improve display of remote names.
  * When annex.freezecontent-command or annex.thawcontent-command is
    configured but fails, prevent initialization. This allows the user to
    fix their configuration and avoid crippled filesystem detection
    entering an adjusted branch.
  * assistant: Avoid hanging at startup when a process has a *.lock file
    open in the .git directory.
  * Windows: Fix duplicate file bug that could occur when files were
    supposed to be moved across devices."""]]
