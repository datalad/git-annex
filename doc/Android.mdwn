git-annex is now available for Android. This includes the 
[[git-annex assistant|/assistant]], for easy syncing between your Android
and other devices. You do not need to root your Android to use git-annex.

[[Android installation instructions|/install/android]]

When you run the git-annex Android app, two windows will open. The first is
a terminal window, and the second is a web browser showing the git-annex
webapp.

## closing and reopening the webapp

The webapp does not need to be left open after you've set up your
repository. As long as the terminal window is left open, git-annex will
remain running and sync your files. To re-open the webapp after closing it,
use the [[!img newwindow.png alt="New Window"]] icon in the terminal window.

## starting git-annex

The app is not currently automatically started on boot, so you will need to
manually open it to keep your files in sync. You do not need to leave the
app running all the time, though. It will sync back up automatically when
started.

## stopping git-annex

Simply close the terminal window to stop git-annex from running.

## using the command line

[[!img terminal.png alt="Android terminal"]]

If you prefer to use `git-annex` at the command line, you can do so using the
terminal. A fairly full set of tools is provided, including `git`, `ssh`,
`rsync`, and `gpg`.

To prevent the webapp from being automatically started
when a terminal window opens, go into the terminal preferences, to "Inital
Command", and clear out the default `git annex webapp` setting.

Or, if you'd like to run the assistant automatically, but not open the
webapp, change the "Initial Command" to: `git annex assistant --autostart`

## using from adb shell

To set up the git-annex environment from within `adb shell`, run:
`/data/data/ga.androidterm/runshell`

This will launch a shell that has git-annex, git, etc in PATH.
