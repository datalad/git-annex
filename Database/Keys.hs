{- Looks at staged changes to annexed files, and updates the keys database,
 - so that its information is consistent with the state of the repository.
 -
 - This is run with a lock held, so only one process can be running this at
 - a time.
 -
 - To avoid unncessary work, the index file is statted, and if it's not
 - changed since last time this was run, nothing is done.
 -
 - A tree is generated from the index, and the diff between that tree
 - and the last processed tree is examined for changes.
 -
 - This also cleans up after a race between eg a git mv and git-annex
 - get/drop/similar. If git moves a pointer file between this being run and the
 - get/drop, the moved pointer file won't be updated for the get/drop. 
 - The next time this runs, it will see the staged change. It then checks
 - if the pointer file needs to be updated to contain or not contain the
 - annex content.
 -
 - Note: There is a situation where, after this has run, the database can
 - still contain associated files that have been deleted from the index.
 - That happens when addAssociatedFile is used to record a newly
 - added file, but that file then gets removed from the index before
 - this is run. Eg, "git-annex add foo; git rm foo"
 - So when using getAssociatedFiles, have to make sure the file still
 - is an associated file.
