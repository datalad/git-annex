# provide some apt conf tune ups with hope to make apt more robust in talking to it
# see https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=959518  for more info
# (later apt as now in sid should be more robust)

# Notes: 
# - in APT for NeuroDebian we have #deb-src  for debian-devel, so we need to change
#   that too.
# - APT specification switched away from .list to .sources format in bookworm.
#   nd_freeze works on policy output so works fine but does not disable old source
#   file, so we are moving it to .disabled "manually" here if we do not detect
#   use of snapshot url there (we might implement support that way).
#   Remove after https://github.com/neurodebian/neurodebian/issues/90 is fixed/released
#   for the used date of nd_freeze.
