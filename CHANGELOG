git-annex (8.20200618) UNRELEASED; urgency=medium

  * import: Added --no-content option, which avoids downloading files
    from a special remote. Currently only supported by the directory
    special remote.
  * Honor annex.largefiles when importing a tree from a special remote.
    (Except for when --no-content is used.)
  * Fix a deadlock that could occur after git-annex got an unlocked
    file, causing the command to hang indefinitely. Known to happen on 
    vfat filesystems, possibly others.
  * Build with the http-client-restricted and git-lfs libraries when 
    available, otherwise use the vendored copy as before.
  * testremote: Fix over-allocation of resources and bad caching,
    including starting up a large number of external special remote processes.
    (Regression introduced in version 8.20200501)
  * test: Fix some test cases that assumed git's default branch name.
  * importfeed: Added some additional --template variables:
    itempubyear, itempubmonth, itempubday, itempubhour,
    itempubminute, itempubsecond.
  * Made several special remotes support locking content on them,
    which allows dropping from other special remotes in some situations
    where it was not possible before. Supported special remotes:
    S3 (with versioning=yes), git-lfs, tahoe
  * Fix reversion that broke passing annex.* and remote.*.annex-*
    git configs with -c. (Since version 8.20200330.)
  * Bring back git-annex branch read cache. This speeds up some operations;
    git-annex sync --content --all gets 20% faster.
  * Fix a recently introduced bug that could cause a "fork: resource exhausted"
    after getting several thousand files.
  * Sped up the --all option by 2x to 16x by using git cat-file --buffer.
    Thanks to Lukey for finding this optimisation.
  * Sped up seeking for annexed files to operate on by a factor of nearly 2x.
  * fsck: Detect if WORM keys contain a carriage return, and recommend
    upgrading the key. (git-annex could have maybe created such keys back
    in 2013).

git-annex (8.20200617) upstream; urgency=medium

  * Added annex.skipunknown git config, that can be set to false to change
    the behavior of commands like `git annex get foo*`, to not skip
    over files/dirs that are not checked into git and are explicitly listed in
    the command line.
  * annex.skipunknown is planned to change to default to false in a
    git-annex release in early 2022. If you prefer the current behavior,
    you can explicitly set it to true.
  * Try to enable special remotes configured with autoenable=yes
    when git-annex auto-initialization happens in a new clone of an
    existing repo. Previously, git-annex init had to be explicitly run to
    enable them. Special remotes cannot display anything when autoenabled
    this way, to avoid interfering with the output of git-annex query
    commands.
  * export: Added options for json output.
  * import: Added --json-progress.
  * addurl: Make --preserve-filename also apply when eg a torrent contains
    multiple files.
  * Fix a crash or potentially not all files being exported when 
    sync -J --content is used with an export remote.
  * export: Let concurrent transfers be done with -J or annex.jobs.
  * move --to, copy --to, mirror --to: When concurrency is enabled, run
    cleanup actions in separate job pool from uploads. 
  * init: If lock probing stalls for a long time (eg a broken NFS server),
    display a message to let the user know what's taking so long.
  * init: When annex.pidlock is set, skip lock probing.
  * Fix file descriptor leak when importing from a directory special remote
    that is configured with exporttree=yes.
  * Note that external special remote programs should not block SIGINT or
    SIGTERM.
  * Avoid creating the keys database during init when there are no unlocked
    files, to prevent init failing when sqlite does not work in the
    filesystem.
  * import: Avoid using some strange names for temporary keys,
    which broke importing from a directory special remote onto a vfat
    filesystem.
  * S3: The REDUCED_REDUNDANCY storage class is no longer cheaper so
    stop documenting it, and stop offering it as a choice in the assistant.
  * Improve display of problems auto-initializing or upgrading local git
    remotes.
  * When a local git remote cannot be initialized because it has no
    git-annex branch or a .noannex file, avoid displaying a message about it.
  * checkpresentkey: When no remote is specified, try all remotes, not
    only ones that the location log says contain the key. This is what
    the documentation has always said it did.
  * Fix regression in external special remote handling: GETCONFIG did not
    return a value that was set with SETCONFIG immediately before.
    (Regression introduced in version 7.20200202.7)
  * Fix bug that made initremote of extrnal special remotes with
    embedcreds=yes or gpg encryption not store the creds in the git-annex
    branch. git-annex-remote-googledrive one was special remote affected by
    this bug.
    (Regression introduced in version 7.20200202.7)
  * Fix bug that made creds not be stored in git when a special remote
    was initialized with gpg encryption, but without an explicit
    embedcreds=yes.
    (Regression introduced in version 7.20200202.7)
  * Fix a annex.pidlock issue that made eg git-annex get of an unlocked
    file hang until the annex.pidlocktimeout and then fail.

git-annex (8.20200522) upstream; urgency=medium

  * Fix bug that made enableremote of S3 and webdav remotes, that
    have embedcreds=yes, fail to set up the embedded creds, so accessing
    the remotes failed. (Regression introduced in version 7.20200202.7)
  * addurl, importfeed: Avoid adding filenames with leading '.', instead
    it will be replaced with '_'.
  * addurl, importfeed: Allow '-' in filenames, as long as it's not the
    first character.
  * addurl --preserve-filename: New option, uses server-provided filename
    without any sanitization, but will fail if the filename has an obvious
    security problem like using an escape sequence or trying to escape
    the current directory.
  * whereis: Added --format option.
  * S3: Support signature=v4, to use S3 Signature Version 4.
    Some S3 services seem to require v4, while others may only
    support v2, which remains the default.
  * upgrade: When upgrade fails due to an exception, display it.
  * repair: Improve fetching from a remote with an url in host:path format.
  * git-lfs repos that encrypt the annexed content but not the git repo
    only need --force passed to initremote, allow enableremote and
    autoenable of such remotes without forcing again.
  * When accessing a remote fails, always display a reason why.
  * Display a warning message when a remote uses a protocol, such as
    git://, that git-annex does not support. Silently skipping such a
    remote was confusing behavior.
  * Also display a warning message when a remote, without a known uuid,
    is located in a directory that does not currently exist, to avoid
    silently skipping such a remote.
  * sync: Avoid an ugly error message when nothing has been committed to
    master yet and there is a synced master branch to merge from.
  * Display a warning message when asked to operate on a file inside a
    directory that's a symbolic link to elsewhere.
  * Support building with tasty-1.3.

git-annex (8.20200501) upstream; urgency=medium

  * Improve git-annex's ability to find the path to its program,
    especially when it needs to run itself in another repo to upgrade it.
  * adb: Better messages when the adb command is not installed.
  * Sped up query commands that read the git-annex branch by around 9%.
  * Various speed improvements gained by using ByteStrings for git refs and
    shas.
  * Fix a potential failure to parse git config.
  * Support boolean git configs that are represented by the name of the
    setting with no value, eg "core.bare" is the same as "core.bare = true".
  * When parsing git configs, support all the documented ways to write
    true and false, including "yes", "on", "1", etc.
  * Fix --batch commands (and git-annex info) to accept absolute filenames 
    for unlocked files, which already worked for locked files.
  * Avoid repeatedly opening keys db when accessing a local git remote
    and -J is used.
  * Avoid running a large number of git cat-file child processes when run
    with a large -J value.
  * Avoid running with more git check-attr and check-ignore processes than
    there are CPU cores when run with a large -J value.
  * get --from, move --from: When used with a local git remote, these used
    to silently skip files that the location log thought were present on the
    remote, when the remote actually no longer contained them. Since that
    behavior could be surprising, now instead display a warning.
  * external special remotes: remote.name.annex-readonly=true no longer
    disables running the external special remote program. Instead, it just
    makes the remote operate in a readonly mode, same as any remote.
    To disable running the external special remote program, now need to set
    remote.name.annex-externaltype=readonly. That is done when
    git-annex enableremote is passed readonly=true.
  * Stop storing readonly=true in remote.log of external special remotes;
    it is a local setting only.
  * sync: When some remotes to sync with are specified, and --fast is too,
    pick the lowest cost of the specified remotes, do not sync with a
    faster remote that was not specified.
  * addurl: When run with --fast on an url that 
    annex.security.allowed-ip-addresses prevents accessing, display
    a more useful message.
  * When the required content is set to "groupwanted", use whatever
    expression has been set in groupwanted as the required content of the
    repo, similar to how setting required content to "standard" already
    worked.
  * Avoid a test suite failure when the environment does not let gpg be
    tested due to eg, too long a path to the agent socket.
  * test: Include testremote tests, run on a directory special remote.

git-annex (8.20200330) upstream; urgency=medium

  * fsck: Fix reversion in 8.20200226 that made it incorrectly warn
    that hashed keys with an extension should be upgraded.
  * add --force-small: Fix a bug that, when adding a symbolic link,
    checked in the content of the file the symlink pointed to.
    Thanks, Kyle Meyer for the patch.
  * add --force-small: Fix failure when passed a modified submodule.
    Thanks, Kyle Meyer for the patch.
  * When syncing changes back from an adjusted branch to the basis branch,
    include changes to submodules.
    Thanks, Kyle Meyer for the patch.
  * webdav: Made exporttree remotes faster by caching connection to the
    server.
  * Fix a minor bug that caused options provided with -c to be passed
    multiple times to git.

 -- Joey Hess <id@joeyh.name>  Mon, 30 Mar 2020 12:14:50 -0400

git-annex (8.20200309) upstream; urgency=medium

  * Fix bug that caused unlocked annexed dotfiles to be added to git by the
    smudge filter when annex.dotfiles was not set.
  * Upgrade other repos than the current one by running git-annex upgrade
    inside them, which avoids problems with upgrade code making assumptions
    that the cwd will be inside the repo being upgraded. In particular,
    this fixes a problem where upgrading a v7 repo to v8 caused an ugly
    git error message.
  * Fix upgrade failure when a file has been deleted from the working tree.
  * Fix regression 1 month ago that prevented external special remotes from
    using GETCONFIG to query values like "name".
  * Improve behavior when a directory git-annex is writing to gets
    unmounted. Previously it could in some cases re-create the mount point
    and directory tree, and even write object contents to the wrong disk.
  * Don't ignore --debug when it is followed by -c.
  * whereis: If a remote fails to report on urls where a key
    is located, display a warning, rather than giving up and not displaying
    any information.
  * When external special remotes fail but neglect to provide an error
    message, say what request failed, which is better than displaying an
    empty error message to the user.
  * git-annex config: Only allow configs be set that are ones git-annex
    actually supports reading from repo-global config, to avoid confusion.
  * Avoid converting .git file in a worktree or submodule to a symlink
    when the repository is not a git-annex repository.
  * Linux standalone: Use md5sum to shorten paths in .cache/git-annex/locales
  * Fix build with ghc 8.8 (MonadFail)
    Thanks, Peter Simons
  * stack.yaml: Updated to lts-14.27.

git-annex (8.20200226) upstream; urgency=medium

  * New v8 repository version.
  * v7 upgrades automatically to v8. The upgrade deletes old sqlite
    databases, which may cause git-annex to need to do extra work to
    regenerate the databases or due to not having the information from the
    old databases available. Two notable cases are interrupted incremental
    fscks and interrupted exports, both of which will restart from the
    beginning.
  * Improved serialization of filenames and keys to the sqlite databases,
    avoiding encoding problems and speeding up operations on them.
  * Add some missing indexes to sqlite databases. This will speed up
    some things involving export and import remotes, and git-annex smudge.
    Microbenchmarks show around 10-25% speedup of sqlite database operations.
  * add: When adding a whole directory, any dotfiles found in it will
    not be skipped, but will be added to git by default. This behavior
    can be configured with annex.dotfiles.
  * add: Removed special case for explicitly passing dotfiles,
    that no longer adds them to the annex, but to git. This behavior
    can be configured with annex.dotfiles.
  * add: Removed the --include-dotfiles option.
  * initremote, enableremote: Set remote.name.skipFetchAll when
    the remote cannot be fetched from by git, so git fetch --all
    will not try to use it.
  * Fix some cases where handling of keys with extensions varied depending
    on the locale.
  * annex.maxextensionlength used to be the number of characters, not
    bytes, when in a utf-8 locale. It's now always the number of bytes.
  * Extended annex.security.allowed-ip-addresses to let specific ports
    of an IP address to be used, while denying use of other ports.
  * init --version: When the version given is one that automatically
    upgrades to a newer version, use the newer version instead.
  * Auto upgrades from older repo versions, like v5, now jump right to v8.
  * Makefile: Support newer versions of cabal that use the new-build system.

git-annex (7.20200226) upstream; urgency=high

  * Fix serious regression in gcrypt and encrypted git-lfs remotes.
    Since version 7.20200202.7, git-annex incorrectly stored content
    on those remotes without encrypting it.
    If your remotes are affected, you will want to make sure to delete
    any content that git-annex has stored on them that is not encrypted!
  * initremote: Fix regression in parsing the exporttree= parameter.
  * info: Fix display of the encryption value.
    (Some debugging junk had crept in.)
  * Bugfix to getting content from an export remote with -J, when the
    export database was not yet populated.
  * Bugfix: export --tracking (a deprecated option) set 
    annex-annex-tracking-branch, instead of annex-tracking-branch.

git-annex (7.20200219) upstream; urgency=medium

  * Added sync --only-annex, which syncs the git-annex branch and annexed
    content but leaves managing the other git branches up to you.
  * Added annex.synconlyannex git config setting, which can also be set with
    git-annex config to configure sync in all clones of the repo.
  * fsck --from remote: Fix a concurrency bug that could make it incorrectly
    detect that content in the remote is corrupt, and remove it, resulting in
    data loss.
  * When git-annex is built with a ssh that does not support ssh connection
    caching, default annex.sshcaching to false, but let the user override it.
  * Improve warning messages further when ssh connection caching cannot
    be used, to clearly state why.
  * Avoid throwing fatal errors when asked to write to a readonly
    git remote on http.
  * Fix support for repositories tuned with annex.tune.branchhash1=true,
    including --all not working and git-annex log not displaying anything
    for annexed files.

  * Makefile: Really move the fish completion to the
    vendor_completions.d directory.

 -- Joey Hess <id@joeyh.name>  Tue, 04 Feb 2020 14:30:55 -0400

git-annex (7.20200202.7) upstream; urgency=medium

  * add: --force-annex/--force-git options make it easier to override
    annex.largefiles configuration (and potentially safer as it avoids
    bugs like the smudge bug fixed in the last release).
  * reinject --known: Fix bug that prevented it from working in a bare repo.
  * Support being used in a git repository that uses sha256 rather than sha1.
  * initremote, enableremote: Be stricter about rejecting invalid
    configuration parameters for remotes, particularly things like foo=true
    when foo=yes is expected.
  * initremote, enableremote: Reject unknown configuration parameters
    provided to these commands.
  * initremote: Added --whatelse option, to show additional
    configuration parameters you might want to set. Eg:
    git annex initremote type=directory encryption=none --whatelse
  * Added LISTCONFIGS to external special remote protocol. Special remote
    programs that use GETCONFIG/SETCONFIG are recommended to implement it.
  * init: Avoid an ugly error message when http remote has no git-annex
    uuid configured.
  * Support git remotes that need http basic auth to be accessed,
    using git credential to get the password.
  * Display a warning when concurrency is enabled but ssh connection caching
    is not enabled or won't work due to a crippled filesystem.
  * Makefile: Move the fish completion to the vendor_completions.d directory.
  * Fixed a test suite failure when run in the C locale.

git-annex (7.20191230) upstream; urgency=medium

  * Optimised processing of many files, especially by commands like find
    and whereis that only report on the state of the repository. Commands
    like get also sped up in cases where they have to check a lot of
    files but only transfer a few files. Speedups range from 30-100%.
  * Added build dependency on the filepath-bytestring library.
  * Fixed an oversight that had always prevented annex.resolvemerge
    from being honored, when it was configured by git-annex config.
  * annex.largefiles can be configured by git-annex config,
    to more easily set a default that will also be used by clones,
    without needing to shoehorn the expression into the gitattributes file.
    The git config and gitattributes override that.
  * annex.addunlocked can be set to an expression with the same format used by
    annex.largefiles, when you want to default to unlocking some files but
    not others.
  * annex.addunlocked can be configured by git-annex config.
  * git-annex-config --set/--unset: No longer change the local git config
    setting, except for in the special case of annex.securehashesonly.
  * Improve file ordering behavior when one parameter is "." and other
    parameters are other directories.
  * smudge bugfix: When annex.largefiles=anything, files that were already
    stored in git, and have not been modified could sometimes be converted
    to being stored in the annex. Changes in 7.20191024 made this more
    of a problem. This case is now detected and prevented.

git-annex (7.20191218) upstream; urgency=medium

  * git-lfs: The url provided to initremote/enableremote will now be
    stored in the git-annex branch, allowing enableremote to be used without
    an url. initremote --sameas can be used to add additional urls.
  * git-lfs: When there's a git remote with an url that's known to be
    used for git-lfs, automatically enable the special remote.
  * sync, assistant: Pull and push from git-lfs remotes.
  * Fix bug that made bare repos be treated as non-bare when --git-dir
    was used.
  * inprogress: Support --key.
  * Sped up many git-annex commands that operate on many files, by 
    avoiding reserialization of keys.
    find is 7% faster; whereis is 3% faster; and git-annex get when
    all files are already present is 5% faster
  * Stop displaying rsync progress, and use git-annex's own progress display
    for local-to-local repo transfers.
  * benchmark: Changed --databases to take a parameter specifiying the size
    of the database to benchmark.
  * benchmark --databases: Display size of the populated database.
  * benchmark --databases: Improve the "addAssociatedFile (new)"
    benchmark to really add new values, not overwriting old values.
  * Windows: Fix handling of changes to time zone. (Used to work but was
    broken in version 7.20181031.)

git-annex (7.20191024) upstream; urgency=medium

  * Changed git add/git commit -a default behavior back to what it was
    before v7; they add file contents to git, not to the annex. 
    (However, if a file was annexed before, they will still add it to
    the annex, to avoid footgun.)
  * Configuring annex.largefiles overrides that; once git-annex has
    been told which files are large git add/git commit -a will annex them.
  * Added annex.gitaddtoannex configuration. Setting it to false prevents
    git add from adding files to the annex even when annex.largefiles
    is configured. (Unless the file was annexed before.)
  * smudge: Made git add smarter about renamed annexed files. It can tell
    when an annexed file was renamed, and will add it to the annex, 
    and not to git, unless annex.largefiles tells it to do otherwise.
  * init: Fix a failure when used in a submodule on a crippled filesystem.
  * sync: Fix crash when there are submodules and an adjusted branch is
    checked out.
  * enable-tor: Deal with pkexec changing to root's home directory
    when running a command.

git-annex (7.20191017) upstream; urgency=medium

  * initremote: Added --sameas option, allows for two special remotes that
    access the same data store.
  * Note that due to complications of the sameas feature, any external
    special remotes that try to send SETSTATE or GETSTATE during INITREMOTE
    or EXPORTSUPPORTED will now get back an ERROR. That would be a very
    hackish thing for an external special remote to do, needing some kind
    of hard-coded key value to be used, so probably nothing will be affected.
  * forget --drop-dead: Remove several classes of git-annex log files
    when they become empty, further reducing the size of the git-annex branch.
  * OSX: Deal with symbolic link problem that caused git to not be included in
    the git-annex.dmg.

git-annex (7.20191009) upstream; urgency=medium

  * Fix bug in handling of annex.largefiles that use largerthan/smallerthan.
    When adding a modified file, it incorrectly used the file size of the
    old version of the file, not the current size.
  * Added --mimetype and --mimeencoding file matching options.
  * Added --unlocked and --locked file matching options.
  * Added adjust --lock, to enter an adjusted branch where files are locked.
  * git-lfs: Added support for http basic auth.
  * git-lfs: Only do endpoint discovery once when concurrency is enabled.
  * fsck --incremental/--more: Fix bug that prevented the incremental fsck
    information from being updated every 5 minutes as it was supposed to be;
    it was only updated after 1000 files were checked, which may be more
    files that are possible to fsck in a given fsck time window.
    Thanks to Peter Simons for help with analysis of this bug.
  * Test: Use more robust directory removal when built with directory-1.2.7.
  * Close sqlite databases more robustly.
  * remotedaemon: Don't list --stop in help since it's not supported.
  * enable-tor: Run kdesu with -c option.
  * enable-tor: Use pkexec to run command as root when gksu and kdesu are not
    available.
  * When dropping an unlocked file, preserve its mtime, which avoids
    git status unncessarily running the clean filter on the file.
  * uninit: Remove several git hooks that git-annex init sets up.
  * uninit: Remove the smudge and clean filters that git-annex init sets up.
  * Work around git cat-file --batch's odd stripping of carriage return
    from the end of the line (some windows infection), avoiding crashing
    when the repo contains a filename ending in a carriage return.
  * git-annex-standalone.rpm: Fix the git-annex-shell symlink.

  * Automatically upgrade v5 repositories to v7.
  * Automatically convert direct mode repositories to v7 with adjusted
    unlocked branches and set annex.thin.
  * Added annex.autoupgraderepository configuration that can be set to false
    to prevent any automatic repository upgrades.
  * Refuse to upgrade direct mode repositories when git is older than 2.22,
    which fixed a memory leak that could cause an OOM during the upgrade.
  * Removed support for git versions older than 2.1.
  * assistant: When creating a new repository, no longer use direct
    mode, instead use v7 adjusted branches with annex.thin.
  * init: When run on a crippled filesystem with --version=5,
    will error out, since version 7 is needed for adjusted unlocked branch.
  * direct: This command always errors out as direct mode is no longer
    supported.
  * indirect: This command has become a deprecated noop.
  * proxy: This command is deprecated because it was only needed in direct
    mode. (But it continues to work.)
  * info: Removed the "repository mode" from its output (including the
    --json output) since with the removal of direct mode, there is no
    repository mode.
  * info: When file matching options are specified when getting
    info of something other than a directory, they won't have any effect,
    so error out to avoid confusion.
  * info: Display trust level when getting info on a uuid, same as a remote.
  * When upgrading a direct mode repo to v7 with adjusted unlocked branches,
    fix a bug that prevented annex.thin from taking effect for the files
    in working tree.
  * Avoid making a commit when upgrading from direct mode to v7.
  * init: Catch more exceptions when testing locking.
  * init: Fix a reversion that broke initialization on systems that
    need to use pid locking.
  * A git-annex-standalone rpm is now distributed along with the standalone
    tarball.
  * Added standalone/rpm/rpmbuild-from-standalone-tarball script.

git-annex (7.20190819) upstream; urgency=medium

  * New git-lfs special remote, which can be used to store data on any git-lfs
    server, including github, gitlab, and gogs.
  * Support fully encrypting all data sent to a git-lfs special remote,
    using a combination of gcrypt to encrypt the git data, and git-annex's
    encryption of its data.
  * Use the same optimisation for --in=here as has always been
    used for --in=. rather than the slow code path that unncessarily
    queries the git-annex branch.
  * Allow setting up a gcrypt special remote with encryption=shared.
  * Fix querying git for object type when operating on a file containing
    newlines.
  * merge: When run with a branch parameter, merges from that branch.
    This is especially useful when using an adjusted branch, because
    it applies the same adjustment to the branch before merging it.
  * init: Install working hook scripts when run on a crippled filesystem
    and on Windows. If your repository was set up by an old version
    of git-annex that omitted the hooks, you can simply re-run git-annex init
    to install them.
  * init: When the repo is already initialized, and --version requests a
    different version, error out rather than silently not changing the
    version.
  * S3: Fix encoding when generating public urls of S3 objects.
  * Make git-annex-standalone.deb include the shell completions again.
  * Makefile: Changed default zsh completion location to zsh default fpath.
    Systems such as Debian that have overridden the default fpath will
    need to set ZSH_COMPLETIONS_PATH.
  * test: Add pass using adjusted unlocked branch.
  * Fix intermittent failure of the test suite, where its repeated opening
    and writing to the sqlite database somehow caused inode cache information
    to occasionally be lost.
  * Fix several test suite failures on Windows.
  * Windows installer: Always install to 64 bit program files directory,
    since it needs 64 bit git now.
  * Build with silently-1.2.5.1 on Windows; the old one used "NUL" device
    which is not supported with recent versions of ghc.

git-annex (7.20190730) upstream; urgency=medium

  * Improved probing when CoW copies can be made between files on the same
    drive. Now supports CoW between BTRFS subvolumes. And, falls back to rsync
    instead of using cp when CoW won't work, eg copies between repos on the
    same EXT4 filesystem.
  * Add BLAKE2BP512 and BLAKE2BP512E backends, using a blake2 variant
    optimised for 4-way CPUs.
  * Support running v7 upgrade in a repo where there is no branch checked
    out, but HEAD is set directly to some other ref.
  * Windows build no longer ships with a copy of rsync, since that is only
    used any more to access rsync special remotes or remotes with a very
    old version of git-annex-shell.
  * Windows build is now 64 bit, and using it with the 64 bit git for
    Windows is fully supported.
  * Windows problems with long filenames should be fixed now,
    since the Windows build is made with a newer ghc version that works
    around the problems.
  * stack.yaml: Build with http-client-0.5.14 to get a bug fix to http header
    parsing.
  * Drop support for building with ghc older than 8.4.4,
    and with older versions of serveral haskell libraries.
  * Support building with socks-0.6 and persistant-template-2.7.
  * Corrected some license statements.
    Thanks, Sean Whitton.

git-annex (7.20190626) upstream; urgency=medium

  * get, move, copy, sync: When -J or annex.jobs has enabled concurrency,
    checksum verification uses a separate job pool than is used for
    downloads, to keep bandwidth saturated.
  * Other commands also run their cleanup phase using a separate job pool
    than their perform phase, which may make some of them somewhat faster
    when running concurrently as well.
  * When downloading an url and the destination file exists but is empty,
    avoid using http range to resume, since a range "bytes=0-" is an unusual
    edge case that it's best to avoid relying on working. This is known to
    fix a case where importfeed downloaded a partial feed from such a server.
  * importfeed: When there's a problem parsing the feed, --debug will
    output the feed content that was downloaded.
  * init: Fix a reversion in the last release that prevented automatically
    generating and setting a description for the repository.
  * add: Display progress meter when hashing files.
  * add: Support --json-progress option.
  * The Linux standalone arm build now works again on CPU versions below
    arm6. Thanks to Emanuele Olivetti, Ilias Tsitsimpis, Bernhard
    Übelacker, and Adrian Bunk for fixing ghc in Debian (bug #928882).
  * OSX dmg: Put git-annex's version in the Info.plist file.

git-annex (7.20190615) upstream; urgency=medium

  * Fixed bug that caused git-annex to fail to add a file when another
    git-annex process cleaned up the temp directory it was using.
  * Makefile: Added install-completions to install target.
  * Added the ability to run one job per CPU (core), by setting
    annex.jobs=cpus, or using option --jobs=cpus or -Jcpus.
  * Honor preferred content of a special remote when exporting trees to it;
    unwanted files are filtered out of the tree that is exported.
  * Importing from a special remote honors its preferred content too;
    unwanted files are not imported. But, some preferred content
    expressions can't be checked before files are imported, and trying to
    import with such an expression will fail.
  * Don't try to import .git directories from special remotes, because
    git does not support storing git repositories inside a git repository.
  * Improve shape of commit tree when importing from unversioned special
    remotes.
  * init: When the repository already has a description, don't change it.
  * describe: When run with no description parameter it used to set
    the description to "", now it will error out.
  * Android: Improve installation process when the user's login shell is not
    bash.
  * When a remote is configured to be readonly, don't allow changing
    what's exported to it.
  * Renamed annex.security.allowed-http-addresses to
    annex.security.allowed-ip-addresses because it is not really specific
    to the http protocol, also limiting eg, git-annex's use of ftp.
    The old name for the config will still work.
  * Add back support for ftp urls, which was disabled as part of the fix for
    security hole CVE-2018-10857 (except for configurations which enabled curl
    and bypassed public IP address restrictions). Now it will work
    if allowed by annex.security.allowed-ip-addresses.
  * Avoid a delay at startup when concurrency is enabled and there are
    rsync or gcrypt special remotes, which was caused by git-annex
    opening a ssh connection to the remote too early.

git-annex (7.20190503) upstream; urgency=medium

  * adb special remote supports being configured with importtree=yes,
    to allow git-annex import of files from an Android device. This can be
    combined with exporttree=yes and git-annex export used to send changes
    back to the Android device.
  * S3 special remote supports being configured with importtree=yes,
    to allow git-annex import of files from a S3 bucket. This can be
    combined with exporttree=yes and git-annex export used to send changes
    back to the S3 bucket.
  * S3: When versioning is enabled on a bucket, importing from it will
    import old versions of files that were written to the bucket as well
    as the current versions. A git history is synthesized to reflect the way
    the bucket changed over time.
  * Fix bug that caused importing from a special remote to repeatedly
    download unchanged files when multiple files in the remote have the same
    content.
  * Made git-annex sync --content much faster when all the remotes it's
    syncing with are export/import remotes.
  * sync: When listing contents on an import remote fails, proceed with
    other syncing instead of aborting.
  * renameremote: New command, changes the name that is used to enable 
    a special remote. Especially useful when you want to reuse the name
    of an old remote for something new.
  * Drop support for building with aws older than 0.14.
  * info: Show when a remote is configured with importtree.
  * Added mimeencoding= term to annex.largefiles expressions.
    This is probably mostly useful to match non-text files with eg
    "mimeencoding=binary"
  * git-annex matchexpression: Added --mimeencoding option.

git-annex (7.20190322) upstream; urgency=medium

  * New feature allows importing from special remotes, using
    git annex import branch:subdir --from remote
  * Directory special remote supports being configured with importree=yes,
    to allow git-annex import of files from the directory. This can be
    combined with exporttree=yes and git-annex export used to send changes
    back to the same directory.
  * Remote tracking branches are updated when importing and exporting to
    special remotes, in ways analagous to how git fetch and git push do.
  * export: Deprecated the --tracking option.
    Instead, users can configure remote.<name>.annex-tracking-branch
    themselves.
  * sync --content: When remote.<name>.annex-tracking-branch is configured,
    import from special remotes.
  * sync, assistant: --no-push and remote.<name>.annex-push prevent exporting
    trees to special remotes.
  * Fix storage of metadata values containing newlines.
    (Reversion introduced in version 7.20190122.)
  * Sped up git-annex export in repositories with lots of keys.
  * S3: Support enabling bucket versioning when built with aws-0.21.1.
  * stack.yaml: Build with aws-0.21.1
  * Fix cleanup of git-annex:export.log after git-annex forget --drop-dead.
  * Makefile: Added install-home target which installs git-annex into
    the HOME directory.
  * addurl --file: Fix a bug that made youtube-dl be used unneccessarily
    when adding an html url that does not contain any media.
  * Add -- before %f in the smudge/clean filter configuration,
    to support filenames starting with dashes.
    (To update the config of existing repositories, you can
    re-run git-annex init.)
  * fsck: Detect situations where annex.thin has caused data loss
    to the content of locked files.
  * Removed bundled gpg from the Linux standalone build and OSX dmg,
    because gpg now always wants to use gpg-agent, and shipping such a daemon
    in those is not a good idea.
  * import: Let --force overwrite symlinks, not only regular files.
  * Android: Fix typo of name of armv7l in installation script.
    Thanks, 4omecha.
  * S3: Added protocol= initremote setting, to allow https to be used
    on a non-standard port.

git-annex (7.20190219) upstream; urgency=medium

  * init: Fix bug when direct mode needs to be enabled on a crippled
    filesystem, that left the repository in indirect mode.
  * Fix false positive in export conflict detection, that occurred
    when the same tree was exported by multiple clones. Previous fix was
    incomplete.
  * When key-based retrieval from a S3 remote with exporttree=yes appendonly=yes
    fails, fall back to trying to retrieve from the exported tree.
    This allows downloads of files that were exported to such a remote
    before versioning was enabled on it.
  * Fix path separator bug on Windows that completely broke git-annex
    since version 7.20190122.
  * Improved speed of S3 remote by only loading S3 creds once.
  * Display progress bar when getting files from export remotes.
  * Fix race in cleanup of othertmp directory that could result in a failure
    attempting to access it.
  * fromkey: Made idempotent.
  * fromkey: Added --json.
  * fromkey --batch output changed to support using it with --json.
    The old output was not parseable for any useful information, so
    this is not expected to break anything.
  * Avoid performing repository fixups for submodules and git-worktrees
    when there's a .noannex file that will prevent git-annex from being
    used in the repository.
  * init: Don't let --force be used to override a .noannex file,
    instead the user can just delete the file.
  * webdav: Exporting files with '#' or '?' in their name won't work because
    urls get truncated on those. Fail in a better way in this case,
    and avoid failing when removing such files from the export, so
    after the user has renamed the problem files the export will succeed.
  * On Windows, avoid using rsync for local copies, since rsync is not
    always available there.
  * Added NetworkBSD build flag to deal with Network.BSD moving to a new
    package.

  * enableremote S3: Do not let versioning=yes be set on existing remote,
    because when git-annex lacks S3 version IDs for files stored in
    the bucket, deleting them would cause data loss.
  * S3: Detect when version=yes but an exported file lacks a S3 version ID,
    and refuse to delete it, to avoid data loss.
  * S3: Send a Content-Type header when storing objects in S3,
    so exports to public buckets can be linked to from web pages.

  * sync --content: Fix dropping unwanted content from the local repository.
  * sync --content: Support dropping local content that has reached an
    exporttree remote that is not untrusted (currently only S3 remotes
    with versioning).
  * init: When --version=5 is passed on a crippled filesystem,
    use a v5 direct mode repo as requested, rather than upgrading to v7
    adjusted unlocked. (Fixes test suite on crippled filesystems.)
  * Some optimisations, including a 10x faster timestamp parser,
    a 7x faster key parser, and improved parsing and serialization of
    git-annex branch data. Many commands will run 5-15% faster.
  * Stricter parser for keys doesn't allow doubled fields or out of order fields.
  * The benchmark command, which only had some old benchmarking of the sqlite
    databases before, now allows benchmarking any other git-annex commands.
  * Support being built with ghc 8.6.3 (MonadFail).
  * Removed old code that cleaned up after a bug in git-annex versions
    3.20111105-3.20111110. In the unlikely event that a repo was
    last touched by that ancient git-annex version, the descriptions
    of remotes would appear missing when used with this version of
    git-annex.
  * Improve uuid.log parser to preserve whitespace in repo descriptions.
  * Improve activity.log parser to not remove unknown values,
    allowing for future expansion.
  * addunused, merge, assistant: Avoid creating work tree files in
    subdirectories in an edge case where the key contains "/".
  * testremote: Support testing readonly remotes with the --test-readonly option.
  * Switch to using .git/annex/othertmp for tmp files other than partial
    downloads, and make stale files left in that directory when git-annex
    is interrupted be cleaned up promptly by subsequent git-annex processes.
  * The .git/annex/misctmp directory is no longer used and git-annex will
    delete anything lingering in there after it's 1 week old.
  * Estimated time to completion display shortened from eg "1h1m1s" to "1h1m".
  * Fix doubled progress display when downloading an url when -J is used.
  * unused: Update suggested git log message to see where data was previously
    used so it will also work with v7 unlocked pointer files.
  * importfeed: Better error message when downloading the feed fails.
  * Make test suite work better when the temp directory is on NFS.
  * webapp: Remove configurator for box.com repository, since their
    webdav support is going away at the end of this January.
  * webapp: Remove configurator for gitlab, which stopped supporting git-annex
    some time ago.
  * Android: For armv71 architecture, use the armel build.
  * Windows: If 64 bit git is installed, use it when installing git-annex.
    (However, rsync still won't work and this is still not the documented way
    to install it.)

  * S3: Improve diagnostics when a remote is configured with exporttree and
    versioning, but no S3 version id has been recorded for a key.
  * findref: Support file matching options: --include, --exclude,
    --want-get, --want-drop, --largerthan, --smallerthan, --accessedwithin
  * Commands supporting --branch now apply file matching options --include,
    --exclude, --want-get, --want-drop to filenames from the branch.
    Previously, combining --branch with those would fail to match anything.
  * add, import, findref: Support --time-limit.
  * Add --branch option to git-annex find and mildly deprecate findref in
    favor of it.
  * webdav: When initializing, avoid trying to make a directory at the top of
    the webdav server, which could never accomplish anything and failed on
    nextcloud servers. (Reversion introduced in version 6.20170925.)
  * Fix a case where upgrade to v7 caused git to think that unlocked files
    were modified.
  * Fix bug upgrading from direct mode to v7: when files in the repository
    were already committed as v7 unlocked files elsewhere, and the
    content was present in the direct mode repository, the annexed files
    got their full content checked into git.
  * Fix bug that caused v7 unlocked files in a direct mode repository

  * info: When used with an exporttree remote, includes an "exportedtree"
    info, which is the tree last exported to the remote. During an export

    two different objects.)
  * Fixed some other potential hangs in the P2P protocol.
  * Fix bash completion of "git annex" to propertly handle files with
    spaces and other problem characters. (Completion of "git-annex"
    already did.)
  * Fix resume of download of url when the whole file content is
    already actually downloaded.
  * When an export conflict prevents accessing a special remote,
    be clearer about what the problem is and how to resolve it.
  * export, sync --content: Avoid unnecessarily trying to upload files
    to an exporttree remote that already contains the files.
  * smudge: When passed a file located outside the working tree, eg by git
    diff, avoid erroring out.
  * drop -J: Avoid processing the same key twice at the same time when
    multiple annexed files use it.
  * When a command is operating on multiple files and there's an error
    with one, try harder to continue to the rest. (As was already done
    for many types of errors including IO errors.)
  * Fixed a crash when using -J with ssh password prompts in

git-annex (7.20181031) upstream; urgency=medium

  * Added v7 repository mode. v6 upgrades automatically to v7, but
    v5 is still the default for now. While v6 was always experimental
    to some degree, its successor v7 is ready for production use!
    http://git-annex.branchable.com/tips/unlocked_files/
  * Direct mode repositories are deprecated; they have many problems
    that v7 fixes, so upgrading them now is recommended (but not yet
    required): git annex upgrade --version=7
  * init: When in a crippled filesystem, initialize a v7 repository
    using an adjusted unlocked branch, instead of a direct mode repository.
  * At long last there's a way to hide annexed files whose content
    is missing from the working tree: git-annex adjust --hide-missing
    See https://git-annex.branchable.com/tips/hiding_missing_files/
  * When already in an adjusted branch, running git-annex adjust
    again will update the branch as needed. This is mostly
    useful with --hide-missing to hide/unhide files after their content
    has been dropped or received.
  * git-annex sync --content supports --hide-missing; it can
    be used to get the content of hidden files, and it updates the
    adjusted branch to hide/unhide files as necessary.
  * smudge: The smudge filter no longer provides git with annexed
    file content, to avoid a git memory leak, and because that did not
    honor annex.thin. Now git annex smudge --update has to be run
    after a checkout to update unlocked files in the working tree 
    with annexed file contents.
  * v7 init, upgrade: Install git post-checkout and post-merge hooks that run 
    git annex smudge --update.
  * precommit: Run git annex smudge --update, because the post-merge
    hook is not run when there is a merge conflict. So the work tree will
    be updated when a commit is made to resolve the merge conflict.
  * Note that git has no hooks run after git stash or git cherry-pick,
    so the user will have to manually run git annex smudge --update
    after such commands.
  * Removed the old Android app.
  * Removed support for building with very old ghc < 8.0.1,
    and with yesod < 1.4.3, and without concurrent-output,
    which were only being used for the Android cross build.
  * Webapp: Fix termux detection.
  * runshell: Use system locales when built with 
    GIT_ANNEX_PACKAGE_INSTALL set. (For Neurodebian packages.)
  * Fix database inconsistency that could cause git-annex to
    get confused about whether a locked file's content was present.
  * Fix concurrency bug that occurred on the first download from an
    exporttree remote.
  * init --version=6 will still work, but the repository is auto-upgraded

  * Improve display when git config download from a http remote fails.
  * Added annex.jobs setting, which is like using the -J option.
  * Fix reversion in support of annex.web-options.

git-annex (6.20180926) upstream; urgency=medium

  [ Joey Hess ]
  * Fixes a reversion in the last release that broke interoperation with
    older versions of git-annex-shell.
  * init: Improve generated post-receive hook, so it won't fail when
    run on a system whose git-annex is too old to support git-annex post-receive
  * init: Update the post-receive hook when re-run in an existing repository.
  * S3: Fix url construction bug when the publicurl has been set to an url
    that does not end with a slash.
  * --debug shows urls accessed by git-annex, like it used to do when 
    git-annex used wget and curl.
  * Fix support for filenames containing newlines when querying git
    cat-file, though less efficiently than other filenames.
    This should make git-annex fully support filenames containing newlines
    as the rest of git's interface is used in newline-safe ways.
  * Added -z option to git-annex commands that use --batch, useful for
    supporting filenames containing newlines.
  * Added annex.maxextensionlength for use cases where extensions longer
    than 4 characters are needed.
  * Added remote.name.annex-security-allow-unverified-downloads, a
    per-remote setting for annex.security.allow-unverified-downloads.
  * More FreeBSD build fixes.

git-annex (6.20180913) upstream; urgency=medium

  * When --batch is used with matching options like --in, --metadata,
    etc, only operate on the provided files when they match those options.
    Otherwise, a blank line is output in the batch protocol.
    Affected commands: find, add, whereis, drop, copy, move, get
  * Make metadata --batch combined with matching options refuse to run,
    since it does not seem worth supporting that combination.
  * v6 add: Take advantage of improved SIGPIPE handler in git 2.5 to
    speed up the clean filter by not reading the file content from the
    pipe. This also avoids git buffering the whole file content in memory.
  * v6: After updating the worktree for an add/drop, update git's index,
    so git status will not show the files as modified.
  * v6: When annex.largefiles is not configured for a file, running git
    add or git commit, or otherwise using git to stage a file
    will add it to the annex if the file was in the annex before,
    and to git otherwise. This is to avoid accidental conversion.
    Note that git-annex add's behavior has not changed.
  * v6: Update associated files database when git has staged changes
    to pointer files.
  * v6: Fix some race conditions.
  * v6: Fix annex object file permissions when git-annex add is run
    on a modified unlocked file, and in some related cases.
  * v6: When a file is unlocked but has not been modified,
    and the unlocking is only staged, git-annex add did not lock it.
    Now it will, for consistency with how modified files are handled and
    with v5.
  * Fix git command queue to be concurrency safe.
  * linux standalone: When LOCPATH is already set, use it instead of the
    bundled locales. It can be set to an empty string to use the system
    locales too.
  * Stop using external hash programs, since cryptonite is faster.
  * Fix build on FreeBSD.
  * S3: Support buckets with versioning enabled. When a remote
    is configured with exporttree=yes versioning=yes, git-annex can
    download past versions of exported files from it.
  * S3: Multipart uploads are now only supported when git-annex is built
    with aws-0.16.0 or later, as earlier versions of the library don't
    support versioning with multipart uploads.
  * S3: Support AWS_SESSION_TOKEN.
  * Don't use GIT_PREFIX when GIT_WORK_TREE=. because it seems git
    does not intend GIT_WORK_TREE to be relative to GIT_PREFIX in that
    case, despite GIT_WORK_TREE=.. being relative to GIT_PREFIX.
  * Don't use GIT_PREFIX to fix up a relative GIT_DIR, because
    git 2.11 sets GIT_PREFIX to a path it's not relative to.
    and apparently GIT_DIR is never relative to GIT_PREFIX.
  * git-annex.cabal: Fix build without assistant, and some other refinements.

  * Improve support for repositories created with --separate-git-dir.
  * Support configuring remote.web.annex-cost and remote.bittorrent.annex-cost
  * addurl: When security configuration prevents downloads with youtube-dl,
    still check if the url is one that it supports, and fail downloading
    it, instead of downloading the raw web page.
  * Send User-Agent and any configured annex.http-headers when downloading
    with http, fixes reversion introduced when switching to http-client.
  * Fix reversion introduced in version 6.20180316 that caused git-annex to
    stop processing files when unable to contact a ssh remote.
  * v6: Work around git bug that runs smudge/clean filters at the top of the
    repository while passing them a relative GIT_WORK_TREE that may point
    outside of the repository, by using GIT_PREFIX to get back to the
    subdirectory where a relative GIT_WORK_TREE is valid.
  * p2p --pair: Fix interception of the magic-wormhole pairing code,
    which since 0.8.2 it has sent to stderr rather than stdout.
  * info: Display uuid and description when a repository is identified by
    uuid, and for "here".
  * unused --from: Allow specifiying a repository by uuid or description.
  * linux standalone: Generate locale files in ~/.cache/git-annex/locales/
    so they're available even when the standalone tarball is installed
    in a directory owned by root. Note that this prevents using the
    standalone bundle in environments where HOME is not writable.
  * Include uname command in standalone builds since git-annex uses it.

git-annex (6.20180626) upstream; urgency=high

  Security fix release for CVE-2018-10857 and CVE-2018-10859
  https://git-annex.branchable.com/security/CVE-2018-10857_and_CVE-2018-10859/

  * Refuse to download content, that cannot be verified with a hash, 
    from encrypted special remotes (for CVE-2018-10859),
    and from all external special remotes and glacier (for CVE-2018-10857).
    In particular, URL and WORM keys stored on such remotes won't
    be downloaded. If this affects your files, you can run
    `git-annex migrate` on the affected files, to convert them
    to use a hash.
  * Added annex.security.allow-unverified-downloads, which can override
    the above.
  * Added annex.security.allowed-url-schemes setting, which defaults
    to only allowing http, https, and ftp URLs. Note especially that file:/
    is no longer enabled by default.
  * Removed annex.web-download-command, since its interface does not allow
    supporting annex.security.allowed-url-schemes across redirects.
    If you used this setting, you may want to instead use annex.web-options
    to pass options to curl.
  * git-annex will refuse to download content from http servers on
    localhost, or any private IP addresses, to prevent accidental
    exposure of internal data. This can be overridden with the
    annex.security.allowed-http-addresses setting.
  * Local http proxies will not be used unless allowed by the
    annex.security.allowed-http-addresses setting.
  * Since the interfaces to curl and youtube-dl do not have a way to
    prevent them from accessing localhost or private IP addresses,
    they default to not being used for url downloads.
    Only when annex.security.allowed-http-addresses=all will curl and
    youtube-dl be used.
 
  Non-security fix changes:

  * Fix build with ghc 8.4+, which broke due to the Semigroup Monoid change. 
  * version: Show operating system and repository version list 
    when run outside a git repo too.
  * Fix annex-checkuuid implementation, so that remotes configured that
    way can be used.
  * Fix problems accessing repositories over http when annex.tune.*
    is configured.
  * External special remotes can now add info to `git annex info $remote`,
    by replying to the GETINFO message.
  * adb: Android serial numbers are not all 16 characters long, so accept
    other lengths.
  * Display error messages that come from git-annex-shell when the p2p
    protocol is used, so that diskreserve messages, IO errors, etc from
    the remote side are visible again.
  * When content has been lost from an export remote and 
    git-annex fsck --from remote has noticed it's gone, re-running
    git-annex export or git-annex sync --content will re-upload it.

  * Prevent haskell http-client from decompressing gzip files, so downloads
    of such files works the same as it used to with wget and curl.
  * Workaround for bug in an old version of cryptonite that broke https
    downloads, by using curl for downloads when git-annex is built with it.
  * view, vadd: Fix crash when a git submodule has a name starting with a dot.
  * Don't allow entering a view with staged or unstaged changes.
  * move: --force was accidentially enabling two unrelated behaviors
    since 6.20180427. The older behavior, which has never been well
    documented and seems almost entirely useless, has been removed.
  * copy: --force no longer does anything.
  * migrate: Fix bug in migration between eg SHA256 and SHA256E, 
    that caused the extension to be included in SHA256 keys,
    and omitted from SHA256E keys.
    (Bug introduced in version 6.20170214)
  * migrate: Check for above bug when migrating from SHA256 to SHA256
    (and same for SHA1 to SHA1 etc), and remove the extension that should
    not be in the SHA256 key.
  * fsck: Detect and warn when keys need an upgrade, either to fix up
    from the above migrate bug, or to add missing size information
    (a long ago transition), or because of a few other past key related
    bugs.
  * git-annex-shell: GIT_ANNEX_SHELL_APPENDONLY makes it allow writes,
    but not deletion of annexed content. Note that securing pushes to
    the git repository is left up to the user.
  * setpresentkey: Added --batch support.

    affected git-annex unused and git-annex info.
  * Fix bug in last release that prevented the webapp opening on

  * move: Now takes numcopies configuration, and required content
    configuration into account, and refuses to reduce the current
    number of copies of a file, or remove content that a repository
    requires. --force can override these checks.
    Note that it's still allowed to move the content of a file
    from one repository to another when numcopies is not satisfied, as long
    as the move does not result in there being fewer copies.
  * Fix mangling of --json output of utf-8 characters when not
    running in a utf-8 locale.
  * Fix build with yesod 1.6.
  * Clean up some build warnings with newer versions of ghc and haskell
    libraries.
  * runshell: Unset LD_PRELOAD since preloaded libraries from the host
    system may not get along with the bundled linker.
  * runshell: Added some tweaks to make git-annex work in termux on
    Android. The regular arm standalone tarball now works in termux.
  * Webapp: Support being run inside termux on Android, and offer to set up
    a repository on the sdcard.
  * Assistant: Integrate with Termux:Boot, so when it's installed, the
    assistant is autostarted on boot.
  * Assistant: Fix installation of menus, icons, etc when run

  * import: Avoid buffering all filenames to be imported in memory.
  * Improve memory use and speed of --all and git-annex info remote,

  * Added adb special remote which allows exporting files to Android devices.
  * For url downloads, git-annex now defaults to using a http library,

    use curl. To use the .netrc file, run: 
      git config annex.web-options --netrc
  * git-annex no longer uses wget (and wget is no longer shipped with
    git-annex builds).
  * Enable HTTP connection reuse across multiple files for improved speed.
  * Fix calculation of estimated completion for progress meter.
  * OSX app: Work around libz/libPng/ImageIO.framework version skew
    by not bundling libz, assuming OSX includes a suitable libz.1.dylib.
  * Added annex.retry, annex.retry-delay, and per-remote versions
    to configure transfer retries.
  * Also do forward retrying in cases where no exception is thrown,
    but the transfer failed.
  * When adding a new version of a file, and annex.genmetadata is enabled,
    don't copy the data metadata from the old version of the file,
    instead use the mtime of the file.
  * Avoid running annex.http-headers-command more than once.
  * info: Added "combined size of repositories containing these files"
    stat when run on a directory.
  * info: Changed sorting of numcopies stats table, so it's ordered
    by the variance from the desired number of copies.
  * Fix resuming a download when using curl.

git-annex (6.20180316) upstream; urgency=medium

  * New protocol for communicating with git-annex-shell increases speed
    of operations involving ssh remotes. When not transferring large files,
    git-annex is between 200% and 400% faster using the new protocol,
    and it's just as fast as before when transferring large files.
    (When the remote has an old git-annex-shell, git-annex falls back
    to the old slower code. This fallback is planned to be removed 
    after 5 years or so.)
  * Note that, due to not using rsync to transfer files over ssh
    any longer, permissions and other file metadata of annexed files
    will no longer be preserved when copying them to and from ssh remotes.
    Other remotes never supported preserving that information, so
    this is not considered a regression.
  * Fix data loss bug in content locking over tor, when the remote
    repository is in direct mode, it neglected to check that the content
    was actually present when locking it. This could cause git annex drop
    to remove the only copy of a file when it thought the tor remote had
    a copy.
  * Fix data loss bug when the local repository uses direct mode, and a
    locally modified file is dropped from a remote repsitory. The bug
    caused the modified file to be counted as a copy of the original file.
    (This is not a severe bug because in such a situation, dropping
    from the remote and then modifying the file is allowed and has the same
    end result.)
  * Some downloads will be verified, even when annex.verify=false.
    This is done in some edge cases where there's a likelyhood than an
    object was downloaded incorrectly.
  * Support exporttree=yes for rsync special remotes.
  * Added backends for the BLAKE2 family of hashes, when built with
    a new enough version of cryptonite.
  * Improve SHA*E extension extraction code to not treat parts of the
    filename that contain punctuation or other non-alphanumeric characters
    as extensions. Before, such characters were filtered out.
  * Better ssh connection warmup when using -J for concurrency.
    Avoids ugly messages when forced ssh command is not git-annex-shell.
  * Fix race condition in ssh warmup that caused git-annex to get
    stuck and never process some files when run with high levels of
    concurrency.
  * Fix reversion introduced in 6.20171214 that caused concurrent
    transfers to incorrectly fail with "transfer already in progress".
  * Note that Remote/Git.hs now contains AGPL licensed code,
    thus the license of git-annex as a whole is AGPL. This was already
    the case when git-annex was built with the webapp enabled.
  * Include amount of data transferred in progress display.
  * Dial back optimisation when building on arm, which prevents
    ghc and llc from running out of memory when optimising some files.
    (Unfortunately this fix is incomplete due to a ghc bug.)

    last line.
  * git-annex.cabal: Once more try to not build the assistant on the hurd,
    hopefully hackage finally recognises that OS.
  * Split Test.hs and avoid optimising it much, to need less memory to
    compile.
  * Fix behavior of --json-progress followed by --json, the latter option
    used to disable the former.
  * Added --json-error-messages option, which makes messages
    that would normally be output to standard error be included in

  * Remove temporary code added in 6.20160619 to prime the mergedrefs
    log.
  * importfeed: Fix a failure when downloading with youtube-dl

  * Fix several places where files in .git/annex/ were written with modes
    that did not take the core.sharedRepository config into account.
  * Improve startup time for commands that do not operate on remotes,
    and for tab completion, by not unnessessarily statting paths to
    remotes, which used to cause eg, spin-up of removable drives.
  * Added remote.<name>.annex-checkuuid config, which can be set to false
    to disable the default checking of the uuid of remotes that point to
    directories. This can be useful to avoid unncessary drive spin-ups and
    automounting.

    since quvi is not being actively developed and youtube-dl supports

  * addurl --relaxed got slower, since youtube-dl has to hit the network
    to check for embedded media. If you relied on --relaxed not hitting the
    network for speed reasons, using --relaxed --raw will get the old level
    of speed, but can't be used for urls with embedded videos.
  * importfeed now downloads things linked to by feeds, even when they are

  * Removed no longer needed dependency on yesod-default.
  * Allow exporttree remotes to be marked as dead.
  * initremote, enableremote: Really support gpg subkeys suffixed with an

  * lookupkey: Support being given an absolute filename to a file
    within the current git repository.
  * A top-level .noannex file will prevent git-annex init from being used

  * add: Replace work tree file atomically on systems supporting hard
    links. Avoids a window where interrupting an add could result in
    the file being moved into the annex, with no symlink yet created.
  * webdav: Avoid unncessisarily creating the collection at the top
    of the repository when storing files there, since that collection
    is created by initremote.
    (This seems to work around some brokenness of the box.com webdav
    server, which caused uploads to be very slow or sometimes fail.)
  * webdav: Make --debug show all webdav operations.
  * get -J/move -J/copy -J/mirror -J/sync -J: Avoid "transfer already in
    progress" errors when two files use the same key.
  * Konqueror desktop file location changed to one used by plasma 5.
    Thanks, Félix Sipma.
  * Avoid repeated checking that files passed on the command line exist.
  * Fix build with aws-0.17.
  * stack.yaml: Update to lts-9.9.

git-annex (6.20171003) unstable; urgency=medium

  * webdav: Improve error message for failed request to include the request
    method and path.
  * metadata: Added --remove-all.
  * Warn when metadata is inherited from a previous version of a file,
    to avoid the user being surprised in cases where that behavior is not
    desired or expected.
  * sync: Added --cleanup, which removes local and remote synced/ branches.
  * external: When the external special remote program crashed, a newline
    could be output, which messed up the expected output for --batch mode.
  * external: Avoid checking EXPORTSUPPORTED for special remotes that are
    not configured to use exports.
  * test: Fix reversion that made it only run inside a git repository.
  * copy, move: Behave same with --fast when sending to remotes located
    on a local disk as when sending to other remotes.
  * Fix process and file descriptor leak that was exposed when
    git-annex was built with ghc 8.2.1. Broke git-annex test on OSX
    due to running out of FDs, and may have also leaked in other situations.
  * info: Improve cleanup of stale transfer info files.

  * git-annex export: New command, can create and efficiently update
    exports of trees to special remotes.
  * Use git-annex initremote with exporttree=yes to set up a special remote
    for use by git-annex export.
  * Implemented export to directory, S3, and webdav special remotes.
  * External special remote protocol extended to support export.
    Developers of external special remotes should consider if export makes
    sense for them and add support.
  * sync, assistant: Update tracking exports.
  * Support building with feed-1.0, while still supporting older versions.
  * init: Display an additional message when it detects a filesystem that
    allows writing to files whose write bit is not set.
  * S3: Allow removing files from IA.
  * webdav: Checking if a non-existent file is present on Box.com
    triggered a bug in its webdav support that generates an infinite series
    of redirects. Deal with such problems by assuming such behavior means
    the file is not present.
  * webdav: Fix lack of url-escaping of filenames. Mostly impacted exports
    of filenames containing eg spaces.
  * webdav: Changed path used on webdav server for temporary files.

  * Security fix: Disallow hostname starting with a dash, which
    would get passed to ssh and be treated an option. This could
    be used by an attacker who provides a crafted repository url
    to cause the victim to execute arbitrary code via -oProxyCommand.
    CVE-2017-12976
    (The same class of security hole recently affected git itself.)
  * git-annex.cabal: Deal with breaking changes in Cabal 2.0.
  * Fix build with QuickCheck 2.10.
  * fsck: Support --json.
  * move, copy: Support --batch.
  * Added GIT_ANNEX_VECTOR_CLOCK environment variable, which can be used to
    override the default timestamps used in log files in the git-annex
    branch. This is a dangerous environment variable; use with caution.
  * Fix a git-annex test failure when run on NFS due to NFS lock files
    preventing directory removal.
  * test: Avoid most situations involving failure to delete test
    directories, by forking a worker process and only deleting the test
    directory once it exits.
  * Disable http-client's default 30 second response timeout when HEADing
    an url to check if it exists. Some web servers take quite a long time
    to answer a HEAD request.
  * Added remote configuration settings annex-ignore-command and
    annex-sync-command, which are dynamic equivilants of the annex-ignore
    and annex-sync configurations.
  * Prevent spaces from being embedded in the name of new WORM keys,
    as that handing spaces in keys would complicate things like the
    external special remote protocol.
  * migrate: WORM keys containing spaces will be migrated to not contain
    spaces anymore.
  * External special remotes will refuse to operate on keys with spaces in
    their names. That has never worked correctly due to the design of the
    external special remote protocol. Display an error message suggesting
    migration.
  * Fix incorrect external special remote documentation, which said that
    the filename parameter to the TRANSFER command could not contain
    spaces. It can in fact contain spaces. Special remotes implementors
    that relied on that may need to fix bugs in their special remotes.
  * Fix the external special remotes git-annex-remote-ipfs, 
    git-annex-remote-torrent and the example.sh template to correctly
    support filenames with spaces.
  * Windows: Win32 package has subsumed Win32-extras; update dependency.

  * move --to=here moves from all reachable remotes to the local repository.
  * initremote, enableremote: Support gpg subkeys suffixed with an
    exclamation mark, which forces gpg to use a specific subkey.
  * Improve progress display when watching file size, in cases where
    a transfer does not resume.
  * Fix transfer log file locking problem when running concurrent
    transfers.
  * Avoid concurrent git-config setting problem when running concurrent
    threads.
  * metadata: When setting metadata of a file that did not exist,
    no error message was displayed, unlike getting metadata and most other
    git-annex commands. Fixed this oversight.
  * Added annex.resolvemerge configuration, which can be set to false to 
    disable the usual automatic merge conflict resolution done by git-annex
    sync and the assistant.
  * sync: Added --no-resolvemerge option.
  * Avoid error about git-annex-shell not being found when
    syncing with -J with a git remote where git-annex-shell is not
    installed.
  * Fix bug that prevented transfer locks from working when
    run on SMB or other filesystem that does not support fcntl locks
    and hard links.
  * assistant: Merge changes from refs/remotes/foo/master into master.
    Previously, only sync branches were merged. This makes regular git push
    into a repository watched by the assistant auto-merge.
  * Makefile: Install completions for the fish and zsh shells
    when git-annex is built with optparse-applicative-0.14.
  * assistant: Don't trust OSX FSEvents's eventFlagItemModified to be called
    when the last writer of a file closes it; apparently that sometimes
    does not happen, which prevented files from being quickly added.

    When ssh connection caching is enabled (and when GIT_ANNEX_USE_GIT_SSH
    is not set), only one ssh password prompt will be made per host, and
    only one ssh password prompt will be made at a time.
  * When built with concurrent-output 1.9, ssh password prompts will no
    longer interfere with the -J display.
  * Removed dependency on MissingH, instead depending on the split library.
  * Progress is displayed for transfers of files of unknown size.

git-annex (6.20170510) unstable; urgency=medium

  * When a http remote does not expose an annex.uuid config, only warn
    about it once, not every time git-annex is run.
  * multicast: New command, uses uftp to multicast annexed files, for eg
    a classroom setting.
  * Added remote.<name>.annex-push and remote.<name>.annex-pull
    which can be useful to make remotes that don't get fully synced with
    local changes.
  * Disable git-annex's support for GIT_SSH and GIT_SSH_COMMAND, unless
    GIT_ANNEX_USE_GIT_SSH=1 is also set in the environment. This is
    necessary because as feared, the extra -n parameter that git-annex
    passes breaks uses of these environment variables that expect exactly
    the parameters that git passes.
  * enableremote: When enabling a non-special remote, param=value
    parameters can't be used, so error out if any are provided.
  * enableremote: Fix re-enabling of special remotes that have a git
    url, so that eg, encryption key changes take effect. They were silently
    ignored, a reversion introduced in 6.20160527.
  * gcrypt: Support re-enabling to change eg, encryption parameters.
    This was never supported before.
  * git annex add -u now supported, analagous to git add -u
  * version: Added "dependency versions" line.
  * Keys marked as dead are now skipped by --all.
  * annex.backend is the new name for what was annex.backends, and takes
    a single key-value backend, rather than the unncessary and confusing
    list. The old option still works if set.

  * Bugfix: Passing a command a filename that does not exist sometimes
    did not display an error, when a path to a directory was also passed.
  * status: Propigate nonzero exit code from git status.
  * Linux standalone builds put the bundled ssh last in PATH,
    so any system ssh will be preferred over it.
  * assistant: Add 1/200th second delay between checking each file
    in the full transfer scan, to avoid using too much CPU.
  * get -J: Improve distribution of jobs amoung remotes when there are more
    jobs than remotes.
  * fsck -q: When a file has bad content, include the name of the file
    in the warning message.
  * Windows: Improve handling of shebang in external special remote
    program, searching for the program in the PATH.
  * Drop support for building with old versions of dns, http-conduit,
    directory, feed, and http-types.
  * Windows: Fix bug in shell script shebang lookup code that
    caused a "delayed read on closed handle" error.
  * git-annex-shell: Fix bug when used with a recently cloned repository,
    where "merging" messages were included in the output of configlist
    (and perhaps other commands) and caused a "Failed to get annex.uuid
    configuration" error.
  * Support GIT_SSH and GIT_SSH_COMMAND, which are handled close the same
    as they are by git. However, unlike git, git-annex sometimes needs to
    pass the -n parameter when using these.
  * sync --content-of=path (-C path) added for when you want to sync
    only some files' contents, not the whole working tree.

git-annex (6.20170228) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Cryptographically secure hashes can be forced to be used in a
    repository, by setting annex.securehashesonly.
    This does not prevent the git repository from containing links
    to insecure hashes, but it does prevent the content of such files
    from being added to .git/annex/objects by any method.
  * Tighten key parser to prevent SHA1 collision attacks generating
    two keys that have the same SHA1. (Only done for keys that contain
    a hash). This ensures that signed git commits of annexed files
    will remain secure, as long as git-annex is using a secure hashing
    backend.
  * fsck: Warn about any files whose content is present, that don't
    use secure hashes, when annex.securehashesonly is set.
  * init: When annex.securehashesonly has been set with git-annex config,
    copy that value to the annex.securehashesonly git config.
  * Added --securehash option to match files using a secure hash function,
    and corresponding securehash preferred content expression.
  * sync, merge: Fail when the current branch has no commits yet, instead
    of not merging in anything from remotes and appearing to succeed.
  * Run ssh with -n whenever input is not being piped into it,
    to avoid it consuming stdin that it shouldn't.
    This fixes git-annex-checkpresentkey --batch remote,
    which didn't output results for all keys passed into it. Other
    git-annex commands that communicate with a remote over ssh may also
    have been consuming stdin that they shouldn't have, which could have
    impacted using them in eg, shell scripts.
  * sync: Improve integration with receive.denyCurrentBranch=updateInstead,
    displaying error messages from the remote then it fails to update
    its checked out branch.
  * Added post-recieve hook, which makes updateInstead work with direct
    mode and adjusted branches.
  * init: Set up the post-receive hook.
  * sync: When syncing with a local repository located on a crippled
    filesystem, run the post-receive hook there, since it wouldn't get run
    otherwise. This makes pushing to repos on FAT-formatted removable
    drives update them when receive.denyCurrentBranch=updateInstead.
  * config group groupwanted numcopies schedule wanted required: 
    Avoid displaying extraneous messages about repository auto-init,
    git-annex branch merging, etc, when being used to get information.
  * adjust: Fix behavior when used in a repository that contains
    submodules.
  * Run wget with -nv instead of -q, so it will display HTTP errors.
  * Run curl with -S, so HTTP errors are displayed, even when
    it's otherwise silent.
  * When downloading in --json or --quiet mode, use curl in preference
    to wget, since curl is able to display only errors to stderr, unlike
    wget.
  * status: Pass --ignore-submodules=when option on to git status.
  * config --set: As well as setting value in git-annex branch,
    set local gitconfig. This is needed especially for
    annex.securehashesonly, which is read only from local gitconfig and not
    the git-annex branch.
  * Removed support for building with the old cryptohash library.
    Building with that library made git-annex not support SHA3; it's time
    for that to always be supported in case SHA2 dominoes.
  * git-annex.cabal: Make crypto-api a dependency even when built w/o
    webapp and test suite.

  * Increase default cost for p2p remotes from 200 to 1000.
    This makes git-annex prefer transferring data from special
    remotes when possible.
  * Remove -j short option for --json-progress; that option was already
    taken for --json.
  * vicfg: Include the numcopies configuation.
  * config: New command for storing configuration in the git-annex branch.
  * annex.autocommit can be configured via git-annex config, to control
    the default behavior in all clones of a repository.
  * New annex.synccontent config setting, which can be set to true to make
    git annex sync default to --content. This may become the default at
    some point in the future. As well as being configuable by git config,
    it can be configured by git-annex config to control the default
    behavior in all clones of a repository.
  * stack.yaml: Update to lts-7.18.
  * Some optimisations to string splitting code.
  * unused: When large files are checked right into git, avoid buffering
    their contents in memory.
  * unused: Improved memory use significantly when there are a lot
    of differences between branches.
  * Wormhole pairing will start to provide an appid to wormhole on
    2021-12-31. An appid can't be provided now because Debian stable is going
    to ship a older version of git-annex that does not provide an appid.
    Assumption is that by 2021-12-31, this version of git-annex will be
    shipped in a Debian stable release. If that turns out to not be the
    case, this change will need to be cherry-picked into the git-annex in
    Debian stable, or its wormhole pairing will break.
  * Fix build with aws 0.16. Thanks, aristidb.
  * assistant: Make --autostart --foreground wait for the children it
    starts. Before, the --foreground was ignored when autostarting.
  * initremote: When a uuid= parameter is passed, use the specified
    UUID for the new special remote, instead of generating a UUID.
    This can be useful in some situations, eg when the same data can be
    accessed via two different special remote backends.
  * import: Changed how --deduplicate, --skip-duplicates, and
    --clean-duplicates determine if a file is a duplicate.
    Before, only content known to be present somewhere was considered
    a duplicate. Now, any content that has been annexed before will be
    considered a duplicate, even if all annexed copies of the data have
    been lost.
    Note that --clean-duplicates and --deduplicate still check
    numcopies, so won't delete duplicate files unless there's an annexed
    copy.
  * import: --deduplicate and --skip-duplicates were implemented
    inneficiently; they unncessarily hashed each file twice. They have
    been improved to only hash once.
  * import: Added --reinject-duplicates.
  * Added git template directory to Linux standalone tarball and OSX
    app bundle.
  * Improve pid locking code to work on filesystems that don't support hard
    links.
  * S3: Fix check of uuid file stored in bucket, which was not working.
  * Work around sqlite's incorrect handling of umask when creating
    databases.

  * XMPP support has been removed from the assistant in this release.
    If your repositories used XMPP to keep in sync, that will no longer
    work, and you should enable some other remote to keep them in sync.
    A ssh server is one way, or use the new Tor pairing feature.
  * p2p --pair makes it easy to pair repositories, over Tor, using
    Magic Wormhole codes to find the other repository.
    See http://git-annex.branchable.com/tips/peer_to_peer_network_with_tor/
  * webapp: The "Share with a friend" and "Share with your other devices"
    pages have been changed to pair repositories using Tor and Magic Wormhole.
  * metadata --batch: Fix bug when conflicting metadata changes were
    made in the same batch run.
  * Pass annex.web-options to wget and curl after other options, so that
    eg --no-show-progress can be set by the user to disable the default
    --show-progress.
  * Revert ServerAliveInterval change in 6.20161111, which caused problems
    with too many old versions of ssh and unusual ssh configurations.
    It should have not been needed anyway since ssh is supposted to
    have TCPKeepAlive enabled by default.
  * Make all --batch input, as well as fromkey and registerurl stdin
    be processed without requiring it to be in the current encoding.
  * p2p: --link no longer takes a remote name, instead the --name
    option can be used.
  * Linux standalone: Improve generation of locale definition files,
    supporting locales such as en_GB.UTF-8.
  * rekey --force: Incorrectly marked the new key's content as being
    present in the local repo even when it was not.
  * enable-tor: Put tor sockets in /var/lib/tor-annex/, rather
    than in /etc/tor/hidden_service/.
  * enable-tor: No longer needs to be run as root.
  * enable-tor: When run as a regular user, also tests a connection back to 
    the hidden service over tor.
  * Support all common locations of the torrc file.
  * Always use filesystem encoding for all file and handle reads and

    largerthan, mimetype, and smallerthan; the first two always failed
    to match, and the latter always matched.
  * Relicense 5 source files that are not part of the webapp from AGPL to GPL.
  * map: Run xdot if it's available in PATH. On OSX, the dot command
    does not support graphical display, while xdot does.
  * Debian: xdot is a better interactive viewer than dot, so Suggest
    xdot, rather than graphviz.
  * rmurl: Multiple pairs of files and urls can be provided on the

    Hopefully this mess with esqueleto will be resolved soon.
  * sync: Pass --allow-unrelated-histories to git merge when used with git
    git 2.9.0 or newer. This makes merging a remote into a freshly created
    direct mode repository work the same as it works in indirect mode.
  * Avoid backtraces on expected failures when built with ghc 8;
    only use backtraces for unexpected errors.
  * fsck --all --from was checking the existence and content of files

  * reinject --known: Avoid second, unncessary checksum of file.
  * OSX: Remove RPATHs from git-annex binary, which are not needed,

  * test: Deal with gpg-agent behavior change that broke the test suite.
  * Improve ssh socket cleanup code to skip over the cruft that
    NFS sometimes puts in a directory when a file is being deleted.
  * If a transfer fails for some reason, but some data managed to be sent,
    the transfer will be retried. (The assistant already did this.)
  * Run ssh with ServerAliveInterval 60, so that stalled transfers will
    be noticed within about 3 minutes.
    (Any setting in your ~/.ssh/config or /etc/ssh/ssh_config 
    overrides this.)

git-annex (6.20161012) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Optimisations to time it takes git-annex to walk working tree and find
    files to work on. Sped up by around 18%.
  * Optimisations to git-annex branch query and setting, avoiding repeated
    copies of the environment. Speeds up commands like 
    "git-annex find --in remote" by over 50%.
  * Optimised git-annex branch log file timestamp parsing.
  * Add "total-size" field to --json-progress output.
  * Make --json-progress output be shown even when the size of a object
    is not known.
  * Multiple external special remote processes for the same remote will be
    started as needed when using -J. This should not beak any existing
    external special remotes, because running multiple git-annex commands
    at the same time could already start multiple processes for the same
    external special remotes.
  * Linux standalone: Include locale files in the bundle, and generate
    locale definition files for the locales in use when starting runshell.
    (Currently only done for utf-8 locales.)
  * Avoid using a lot of memory when large objects are present in the git
    repository and have to be checked to see if they are a pointed to an
    annexed file. Cases where such memory use could occur included, but
    were not limited to:
    - git commit -a of a large unlocked file (in v5 mode)
    - git-annex adjust when a large file was checked into git directly
  * When auto-upgrading a v3 remote, avoid upgrading to version 6,
    instead keep it at version 5.
  * Support using v3 repositories without upgrading them to v5.
  * sync: Fix bug in adjusted branch merging that could cause recently
    added files to be lost when updating the adjusted branch.

git-annex (6.20160923) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Rate limit console progress display updates to 10 per second.
    Was updating as frequently as changes were reported, up to hundreds of
    times per second, which used unncessary bandwidth when running git-annex
    over ssh etc.
  * Make --json and --quiet work when used with -J.
    Previously, -J override the other options.
  * addurl, get: Added --json-progress option, which adds progress
    objects to the json output.
  * Remove key:null from git-annex add --json output.
  * copy, move, mirror: Support --json and --json-progress.
  * Improve gpg secret key list parser to deal with changes in gpg 2.1.15.
    Fixes key name display in webapp.
  * info: Support being passed a treeish, and show info about the annexed
    files in it similar to how a directory is handled.
  * sync: Previously, when run in a branch with a slash in its name,
    such as "foo/bar", the sync branch was "synced/bar". That conflicted
    with the sync branch used for branch "bar", so has been changed to
    "synced/foo/bar".
  * Note that if you're using an old version of git-annex to sync with
    a branch with a slash in its name, it won't see some changes synced by
    this version, and this version won't see some changes synced by the older
    version. This is not a problem if there's a central bare repository,
    but may impact other configurations until git-annex is upgraded to this
    version.
  * adjust: Previously, when adjusting a branch with a slash in its name,
    such as "foo/bar", the adjusted branch was "adjusted/bar(unlocked)".
    That conflicted with the adjusted branch used for branch "bar",
    so has been changed to "adjusted/foo/bar(unlocked)"
  * Also, running sync in an adjusted branch did not correctly sync
    changes back to the parent branch when it had a slash in its name.
    This bug has been fixed.
  * addurl, importfeed: Improve behavior when file being added is gitignored.

  * examimekey: Allow being run in a git repo that is not initialized by
    git-annex yet.
  * Android: Fix disabling use of cp --reflink=auto, curl, sha224, and sha384.
  * Make --json and --quiet suppress automatic init messages, and any
    other messages that might be output before a command starts.
    Fixes a reversion introduced in version 5.20150727.
  * Assistant, repair: Filter out git fsck lines about duplicate file
    entries in tree objects.
  * get -J, sync --content -J: Download different files from different
    remotes when the remotes have the same costs.

git-annex (6.20160808) unstable; urgency=medium

  * metadata --json output format has changed, adding a inner json object
    named "fields" which contains only the fields and their values.
    This should be easier to parse than the old format, which mixed up
    metadata fields with other keys in the json object.
    Any consumers of the old format will need to be updated.
  * Added metadata --batch option, which allows getting, setting, deleting,
    and modifying metadata for multiple files/keys.
  * Added --branch option to copy, drop, fsck, get, metadata, mirror, move,
    and whereis commands. This option makes git-annex operate on files that
    are included in a specified branch (or other treeish).
  * git-annex.cabal: Temporarily limit to http-conduit <2.2.0
    since aws 0.14.0 is not compatible with the newer version.
  * git-annex.cabal: Temporarily limit to persistent <2.5
    since esqueleto 2.4.3 is not compatible with the newer version.
  * Removed dependency on json library; all JSON is now handled by aeson.
  * When built with uuid-1.3.12, generate more random UUIDs than before.
    (However, this did not impact git-annex much, so a hard depedency has
    not been added on uuid-1.3.12.)
  * info: When run on a file now includes an indication of whether
    the content is present locally.
  * get, move, copy, mirror: Added --failed switch which retries
    failed copies/moves.
  * Re-enable accumulating transfer failure log files for command-line
    actions (disabled in 5.20150522), and remove the log files after
    successful transfers.

git-annex (6.20160619) unstable; urgency=medium

  * get, drop: Add --batch and --json options.
  * testremote: Fix crash when testing a freshly made external special remote.
  * Remove unnecessary rpaths in the git-annex binary, but only when
    it's built using make, not cabal. 
    This speeds up git-annex startup time by around 50%.
  * Speed up startup time by caching the refs that have been merged into
    the git-annex branch.
    This can speed up git-annex commands by as much as a second,
    depending on the number of remotes.
  * fsck: Fix a reversion in direct mode fsck of a file that is
    present when the location log thinks it is not. Reversion introduced
    in version 5.20151208.
  * uninit: Fix crash due to trying to write to deleted keys db.
    Reversion introduced by v6 mode support, affects v5 too.
  * Fix a similar crash when the webapp is used to delete a repository.
  * Support checking presence of content at a http url that redirects to
    a ftp url.
  * log: Added --all option.
  * New url for git-remote-gcrypt, now maintained by spwhitton.
  * webapp: Don't allow deleting a remote that has syncing disabled,
    as such a deletion will never finish.
    Thanks, Farhan Kathawala.
  * webapp: Escape unusual characters in ssh hostnames when generating
    mangled hostnames. This allows IPv6 addresses to be used on filesystems
    not supporting : in filenames.
  * Avoid any access to keys database in v5 mode repositories, which 
    are not supposed to use that database.
  * Remove the EKG build flag, since Gentoo for some reason decided to
    enable this flag, depsite it not being intended for production use and
    so disabled by default.

git-annex (6.20160613) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Improve SHA*E extension extraction code.
  * Windows: Avoid terminating git-annex branch lines with \r\n when
    union merging and performing transitions.
  * Remove Makefile from cabal tarball; man page building is now handled by
    a small haskell program.
  * sync --content: Fix bug that caused transfers of files to be made 
    to a git remote that does not have a UUID. This particularly impacted
    clones from gcrypt repositories.
  * Pass -S to git commit-tree when commit.gpgsign is set and when
    making a non-automatic commit, in order to preserve current behavior
    when used with git 2.9, which has stopped doing this itself.
  * remotedaemon: Fixed support for notifications of changes to gcrypt
    remotes, which was never tested and didn't quite work before.
  * list: Do not include dead repositories.
  * move --to: Better behavior when system is completely out of disk space;
    drop content from disk before writing location log.
  * Avoid a crash if getpwuid does not work, when querying the user's full
    name.
  * Automatically enable v6 mode when initializing in a clone from a repo
    that has an adjusted branch checked out.
  * v6: Fix initialization of a bare clone of a repo that has an adjusted
    branch checked out.
  * v6: Fix bad automatic merge conflict resolution between an annexed file
    and a directory with the same name when in an adjusted branch.
  * v6: Fix bad merge in an adjusted branch that resulted in an empty tree.
  * v6: Fix bug in initialization of clone from a repo with an adjusted branch
    that had not been synced back to master. 
    (This bug caused broken tree objects to get built by a later git annex
    sync.)
  * v6: Make lock and unlock work on files whose content is not present.
  * v6: Fix update of associated files db when unlocking a file.
  * v6: Make git clean filter preserve the backend that was used for a file.

git-annex (6.20160527) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Split lines in the git-annex branch on \r as well as \n, to deal
    with \r\n terminated lines written by some versions of git-annex on
    Windows. This fixes strange displays in some cases.
  * assistant: Fix bug that caused v6 pointer files to be annexed by the
    assistant.
  * assistant: Fix race in v6 mode that caused downloaded file content to
    sometimes not replace pointer files.
  * add: Adding a v6 pointer file used to annex it; now the pointer file is
    added to git as-is. (git add of a pointer file already did the right
    thing)
  * enableremote: Can now be used to explicitly enable git-annex to use
    git remotes. Using the command this way prevents other git-annex
    commands from probing new git remotes to auto-enable them.
  * enableremote: Remove annex-ignore configuration from a remote.
  * Change git annex info remote encryption description to use wording
    closer to what's used in initremote.
  * Pass the various gnupg-options configs to gpg in several cases where
    they were not before. Most notably, gnupg-decrypt-options is now
    passed when decrypting an encrypted cipher.
  * adjust: Add --fix adjustment, which is useful when the git directory
    is in a nonstandard place.
  * adjust: If the adjusted branch already exists, avoid overwriting it,
    since it might contain changes that have not yet been propigated to the
    original branch.
  * Work around git weirdness in handling of relative path to GIT_INDEX_FILE
    when in a subdirectory of the repository. This affected git annex view.
  * Fix crash when entering/changing view in a subdirectory of a repo that
    has a dotfile in its root.
  * webapp: Avoid confusing display of dead remotes.
  * Support building with ghc 8.0.1.
  * Updated cabal file explicitly lists source files. The tarball
    on hackage will include only the files needed for cabal install;
    it is NOT the full git-annex source tree.
  * debian/changelog, debian/NEWS, debian/copyright: Converted to symlinks
    to CHANGELOG, NEWS, and COPYRIGHT, which used to symlink to these instead.

git-annex (6.20160511) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Fix bug that sometimes prevented git-annex smudge --clean from consuming
    all its input, which resulted in git add bypassing git-annex.
  * Fix build with directory-1.2.6.2.
  * Improve behavior when a just added http remote is not available
    during uuid probe. Do not mark it as annex-ignore, so it will be tried
    again later.
  * Android: Icon refresh.
    Thanks, freewheelinfranks.
  * Added DIRHASH-LOWER to external special remote protocol.
  * git-annex.cabal: Add Setup-Depends.
  * stack.yaml: Enable explicit-setup-deps.
  * Windows: Fix several bugs in propigation of changes from the adjusted
    branch back to the master branch.
  * Windows: Fix an over-long temp directory name.
  * map: Hide dead repositories that are not connected to the graph.
  * map: Changed colors; red is used for untrusted repositories and grey
    for dead.
  * version: Display OS version and architecture too.
  * Propigate GIT_DIR and GIT_WORK_TREE environment to external special
    remotes.
  * Added annex.gnupg-decrypt-options and
    remote.<name>.annex-gnupg-decrypt-options, which are passed to gpg
    when it's decrypting data.
  * fsck: When a key is not previously known in the location log,
    record something so that reinject --known will work.
  * In the unusual configuration where annex.crippledfilesystem=true but
    core.symlinks=true, store object contents in mixed case hash
    directories so that symlinks will point to them.
  * Added new encryption=sharedpubkey mode for special remotes.
    This is useful for makking a special remote that anyone with a clone
    of the repo and your public keys can upload files to, but only you can
    decrypt the files stored in it.

git-annex (6.20160419) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Fix bug that prevented resuming of uploads to encrypted special remotes
    that used chunking.
  * That bug could also expose the names of keys to such remotes, so it is a
    minor security issue.
  * Fix duplicate progress meter display when downloading from a git remote
    over http with -J.
  * reinject: When src file's content cannot be verified, leave it alone,
    instead of deleting it.
  * reinject: Added new mode which can reinject known files into the annex.
    For example: git-annex reinject --known /mnt/backup/*
  * calckey: New plumbing command, calculates the key that would be used
    to refer to a file.
  * Fix bug that prevented annex.sshcaching=false configuration from taking
    effect when on a crippled filesystem. Thanks, divergentdave.
  * git 2.9.0 is going to prevent git merge from merging in unrelated
    branches. Since the webapp's pairing etc features often combine
    together repositories with unrelated histories, work around
    this behavior change when the assistant merges, by passing
    --allow-unrelated-histories. Note though that this is not done
    for git annex sync's merges, so it will follow git's default or
    configured behavior.
  * When git-annex is used with a git version older than 2.2.0, disable
    support for adjusted branches, since GIT_COMMON_DIR is needed to update
    them and was first added in that version of git.
  * Avoid setting LOCPATH in linux standalone builds that are built with
    a ghc that has been fixed to not hang when it cannot find locale files.
  * Isolate test suite from global git config settings.

  * smudge: Print a warning when annex.thin is set, as git's smudge
    interface does not allow honoring that configuration.
  * webapp: When $HOME is a git repository, and has been initialized for
    use by git-annex, opening the webapp went ahead and ran the assistant
    there, annexing all files. Since this is almost certianly not
    desirable, especially when the user is just opening the webapp from
    a dekstop menu which happens to run it in $HOME, the webapp will now not
    treat such a $HOME git repository as a git-annex repository.
  * webapp: Update url to add gitlab.com ssh key.
  * Fix bug in v6 mode that prevented treating unlocked executable files
    as annexed. If you have such files, run git annex init --version=6
    to update the cache after upgrading to this version of git-annex.
  * Preserve execute bits of unlocked files in v6 mode.
  * fsck: Warn when core.sharedRepository is set and an annex object file's
    write bit is not set and cannot be set due to the file being owned
    by a different user.
  * Fix hang when dropping content needs to lock the content on a
    ssh remote, which occurred when the remote has git-annex version
    5.20151019 or newer. (The bug was in the client side; the remote
    git-annex-shell does not need to be upgraded.)

  * Upgrading a direct mode repository to v6 has changed to enter
    an adjusted unlocked branch. This makes the direct mode to v6 upgrade
    able to be performed in one clone of a repository without affecting

  * fsck: When the only copy of a file is in a dead repository, mention
    the repository.
  * info: Mention when run in a dead repository.
  * Linux and OSX standalone builds put the bundled gpg last in PATH,
    so any system gpg will be preferred over it.
  * Avoid crashing when built with MagicMime support, but when the magic

  * Include magic database in the linux and OSX standalone builds.
  * Fix memory leak when hashing files, which triggered during fsck
    when an external hash program was not used.

  * webapp: Fix deletion of current repository directory.
  * Added "nothing" to preferred content expression syntax.
  * annex.largefiles can be configured in .gitattributes too;
    this is particulary useful for v6 repositories, since the
    .gitattributes configuration will apply in all clones of the
    repository.
  * Limit annex.largefiles parsing to the subset of preferred content
    expressions that make sense in its context. So, not "standard"
    or "lackingcopies", etc.
  * annex.largefiles: Add support for mimetype=text/* etc, when git-annex
    is linked with libmagic.
  * matchexpression: Added --largefiles option to parse an annex.largefiles
    expression.
  * Brought back the dbus and xmpp build flags, so build from source can be
    done without C libraries that may be hard to install.
  * init: Fix bugs in submodule .git symlink fixup, that occurred when
    initializing in a subdirectory of a submodule and a submodule of a
    submodule.
  * WebDAV: Set depth 1 in PROPFIND request, for better compatibility with

  * info, add, whereis, find: Support --batch mode.
  * Force output to be line-buffered, even when it's not connected to the

    output, which was not always being flushed at an appropriate time.
  * add, import: Support --json output.
  * addurl --json: Include field for added key (unless the file was
    added directly to git due to annex.largefiles configuration.)
    (Also done by add --json and import --json)
  * registerurl: Check if a remote claims the url, same as addurl does.
  * Bug fix: Git config settings passed to git-annex -c did not always take
    effect.
  * assistant: Use udisks2 dbus events to detect when disks are mounted,
    instead of relying on gnome/kde stuff that is not stable.
  * Fix build with QuickCheck 2.8.2
  * matchexpression: New plumbing command to check if a preferred content
    expression matches some data.
  * Removed the webapp-secure build flag, rolling it into the webapp build
    flag.
  * Removed the quvi, tahoe, feed, and tfds build flags, adding

  * The upgrade to version 6 is not done fully automatically yet, because
    upgrading a direct mode repository to version 6 will prevent old
    versions of git-annex from working in other clones of that repository.
    For details, see http://git-annex.branchable.com/upgrades/
  * init: --version parameter added to control which supported repository
    version to use.
  * init, upgrade: Configure .git/info/attributes to use git-annex
    as a smudge filter. In v6 repository mode, this makes git add
    add files to the annex in unlocked mode, unless overridden by
    annex.largefiles configuration.
  * assistant: In v6 mode, adds files in unlocked mode, so they can
    continue to be modified.
  * Added annex.thin setting, which makes unlocked files in v6 repositories
    be hard linked to their content, instead of a copy. This saves disk
    space but means any modification of an unlocked file will lose the local
    (and possibly only) copy of the old version.
  * Enable annex.thin by default on upgrade from direct mode to v6, since
    direct mode made the same tradeoff.
  * fix: Adjusts unlocked files as configured by annex.thin.
  * persistent-sqlite is now a hard build dependency, since v6 repository
    mode needs it.


  * status: On crippled filesystems, was displaying M for all annexed files
    that were present. Probably caused by a change to what git status
    displays in this situation. Fixed by treating files git thinks are
    modified the same as typechanged files.
  * addurl: Added --batch and --with-files options.
  * addurl: Support --json, particularly useful in --batch mode.
  * addurl: Refuse to overwrite any existing, non-annexed file.
  * Debian: Adjust build dependencies for webapp, DAV. Now available on
    mips, mipsel, but temporarily removed armel since build is failing
    there.
  * info: Fix "backend usage" numbers, which were counting present keys
    twice.
  * info --json: Improve json for "backend usage", using a nested object
    with fields for each backend instead of the previous weird nested lists.
    This may break existing parsers of this json output, if there were any.
  * whereis --json: Make url list be included in machine-parseable form.
  * test: Added --keep-failures option.
  * unused: Bug fix when a new file was added to the annex, and then
    removed (but not git rmed). git still has the add staged in this case,
    so the content should not be unused and was wrongly treated as such.
  * migrate: Copy over metadata to new key.
  * rekey: No longer copies over urls from the old to the new key.
    It makes sense for migrate to do that, but not for this low-level
    (and little used) plumbing command to.
  * view: Fix crash in non-unicode capable locale when entering a view
    of metadata containing a slash or backslash.
  * When annex.http-headers is used to set the User-Agent header, avoid
    sending User-Agent: git-annex
  * Windows: Fix rsync cross-drive hack to work with msys2 rsync.
    Thanks, Pieter Kitslaar.

  * Add S3 features to git-annex version output.
  * webdav: When testing the WebDAV server, send a file with content.
    The empty file it was sending tickled bugs in some php WebDAV server.
  * fsck: Failed to honor annex.diskreserve when checking a remote.
  * Debian: Build depend on concurrent-output.

  * Build with -j1 again to get reproducible build.
  * Display progress meter in -J mode when copying from a local git repo,
    to a local git repo, and from a remote git repo.
  * Display progress meter in -J mode when downloading from the web.
  * map: Improve display of git remotes with non-ssh urls, including http
    and gcrypt. 
  * When core.sharedRepository is set, annex object files are not made mode
    444, since that prevents a user other than the file owner from locking
    them. Instead, a mode such as 664 is used in this case.
  * tahoe: Include tahoe capabilities in whereis display.
  * import: Changed to honor annex.largefiles settings.
  * addurl, importfeed: Changed to honor annex.largefiles settings,
    when the content of the url is downloaded. (Not when using --fast or
    --relaxed.)
  * webapp: Fix bugs that could result in a relative path such as "."
    being written to ~/.config/git-annex/autostart, and ignore any such 
    relative paths in the file.
    This was a reversion caused by the relative path changes in 5.20150113.
  * dropunused: Make more robust when trying to drop an object that has
    already been dropped.
  * Fix reversion in handling of long filenames, particularly when using
    addurl/importfeed, which was introduced in the previous release.

git-annex (5.20151116) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Use concurrent-output library when configured with -fConcurrentOutput.
    This allows nicely displayed messages when using the -J flag.
  * Additional commands now support the -J flag: 
    fsck, drop, add, addurl, import
  * import: Avoid very ugly error messages when the directory files
    are imported to is not a directort, but perhaps an annexed file.
  * Concurrent progress bars are now displayed when using -J with a command
    that moves file contents around.
  * Fix race that could result in an annexed file's symlink not being
    created, when eg, running concurrent git-annex adds.
  * add: Fix error recovery rollback to not move the injested file content
    out of the annex back to the file, because other files may point to
    that same content. Instead, copy the injected file content out to
    recover.
  * quvi may output utf-8 encoded data when the conifigured locale doesn't
    support that; avoid crashing on such invalid encoding.
  * runshell: Avoid failing when $HOME/.ssh does not exist and cannot be
    created.
  * Make the git-annex-standalone.deb prevent runshell from installing
    wrappers into $HOME/.ssh
  * Make git-annex-standalone.deb include the git-annex html documentation,
    desktop file, and base completion file, same as the regular git-annex.deb.
  * fsck: When fscking a dead repo, avoid incorrect "fixing location log"
    message, and display a warning about it being dead, since it's unusual
    to have access to a dead repo.
  * assistant: Pass ssh-options through 3 more git pull/push calls
    that were missed before.
  * Added annex.pidlock and annex.pidlocktimeout configuration to support
    filesystems where POSIX fcntl locks cannot be used.
  * init: Automatically enable annex.pidlock when necessary.

  * Use statvfs on OSX.
  * Symlink timestamp preservation code uses functions
    from unix-2.7.0 when available, which should be more portable.
  * enableremote: List uuids and descriptions of remotes that can be
    enabled, and accept either the uuid or the description in leu if the
    name.
  * Catch up with current git behavior when both repo and repo.git exist;
    it seems it now prefers repo in this case, although historically it may
    have preferred repo.git.
  * Fix failure to build with aws-0.13.0.
  * When built with aws-0.13.0, the S3 special remote can be used to create
    google nearline buckets, by setting storageclass=NEARLINE.

git-annex (5.20151019) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Fix a longstanding, but unlikely to occur bug, where dropping
    a file from a remote could race with other drops of the same file,
    and result in all copies of its content being lost.
  * git-annex-shell: Added lockcontent command, to prevent dropping of
    a key's content. This is necessary due to the above bugfix.
  * In some cases, the above bugfix changes what git-annex allows you to
    drop:
    - When a file is present in several special remotes,
      but not in any accessible git repositories, dropping it from one of
      the special remotes will now fail. Instead, the file has to be
      moved from one of the special remotes to the git repository, and can
      then safely be dropped from the git repository.
    - If a git remote has too old a version of git-annex-shell installed,
      git-annex won't trust it to hold onto a copy of a file when dropping
      that file from the local git repository.
  * Changed drop ordering when using git annex sync --content or the
    assistant, to drop from remotes first and from the local repo last.
    This works better with the behavior changes to drop in many cases.
  * Do verification of checksums of annex objects downloaded from remotes.
  * When annex objects are received into git repositories from other git
    repos, their checksums are verified then too.
  * To get the old, faster, behavior of not verifying checksums, set
    annex.verify=false, or remote.<name>.annex-verify=false.
  * setkey, rekey: These commands also now verify that the provided file
    matches the expected checksum of the key, unless annex.verify=false.
  * reinject: Already verified content; this can now be disabled by
    setting annex.verify=false.
  * sync, merge, assistant: When git merge failed for a reason other
    than a conflicted merge, such as a crippled filesystem not allowing
    particular characters in filenames, git-annex would make a merge commit
    that could omit such files or otherwise be bad. Fixed by aborting the
    whole merge process when git merge fails for any reason other than a
    merge conflict.
  * Allow building with S3 disabled again.
  * Ported disk free space checking code to work on Solaris.
  * Windows webapp: Fix support for entering password when setting
    up a ssh remote.
  * copy --auto was checking the wrong repo's preferred content.
    (--from was checking what --to should, and vice-versa.)
    Fixed this bug, which was introduced in version 5.20150727.
  * Avoid unncessary write to the location log when a file is unlocked
    and then added back with unchanged content.
  * S3: Fix support for using https.
  * Avoid displaying network transport warning when a ssh remote
    does not yet have an annex.uuid set.
  * Debian: Add torrent library to build-depends as it's packaged now,
    and stop recommending bittornado | bittorrent.
  * Debian: Remove build dependency on transformers library, as it is now
    included in ghc.
  * Debian: Remove menu file, since a desktop file is provided and
    lintian says there can be only one.

git-annex (5.20150930) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Added new linux standalone "ancient" build to support kernels
    like 2.6.32.
  * info: Don't allow use in a non-git-annex repository, since it
    uses the git-annex branch and would create it if it were missing.
  * assistant: When updating ~/.ssh/config, preserve any symlinks.
  * webapp: Remove the "disable remote" feature from the UI.
  * S3: When built with aws-0.13.0, supports using more storage classes.
    In particular, storageclass=STANDARD_IA to use Amazon's
    new Infrequently Accessed storage, and storageclass=NEARLINE
    to use Google's NearLine storage.
  * Improve ~/.ssh/config modification code to not add trailing spaces
    to lines it cannot parse.
  * Fix a crash at direct mode merge time when .git/index doesn't exist
    yet. Triggered by eg, git-annex sync --no-commit in a fresh clone of
    a repository.
  * status: Show added but not yet committed files.
  * Added stack.yaml to support easy builds from source with stack.

  * Fix Windows build to work with ghc 7.10.
  * init: Fix reversion in detection of repo made with git clone --shared
  * info: Support querying info of individual files in direct mode.
  * unused: Fix reversion in 5.20150727 that broke parsing of the
    --unused-refspec option. Thanks, Øyvind A. Holm.
  * Make full option parsing be done when not in a git repo, so --help
    can be displayed for commands that require a git repo, etc.
  * fsck: Work around bug in persistent that broke display of
    problematically encoded filenames on stderr when using --incremental.
  * When gpg.program is configured, it's used to get the command to run
    for gpg. Useful on systems that have only a gpg2 command or want to
    use it instead of the gpg command.
  * Windows: Switched to using git for Windows, rather than msysgit.
    Using msysgit with git-annex is no longer supported.
  * Windows: Even when the user neglects to tell the git installer to
    add git to PATH, git-annex will still work from within the git bash
    shell, and the webapp can be used too.
  * sync: Add --no-commit, --no-pull, --no-push options to turn off parts of
    the sync process, as well as supporting --commit, --pull, --push, and
    --no-content options to specify the (current) default behavior.
  * annex.hardlink extended to also try to use hard links when copying from
    the repository to a remote.
  * Improve bash completion, so it completes names of remotes and backends
    in appropriate places.
  * Special remotes configured with autoenable=true will be automatically
    enabled when git-annex init is run.
  * Fix bug in combination of preferred and required content settings.
    When one was set to the empty string and the other set to some expression,
    this bug caused all files to be wanted, instead of only files matching
    the expression.

    non-data-transfer overhead 6x.
  * sync: Support --jobs
  * sync --content: Avoid unnecessary second pull from remotes when 
    no file transfers are made.
  * External special remotes can now be built that can be used in readonly
    mode, where git-annex downloads content from the remote using regular
    http.
  * Added WHEREIS to external special remote protocol.
  * importfeed --relaxed: Avoid hitting the urls of items in the feed.
  * Fix reversion in init when ran as root, introduced in version 5.20150731.
  * Reorder declaration to fix build with yesod-core > 1.4.13.
    Thanks, Michael Alan Dorman.
  * Fix building without quvi and without database.
    Thanks, Ben Boeckel.
  * Avoid building the assistant on the hurd, since an inotify equivalent
    is not yet implemented in git-annex for the hurd.
  * --debug log messages are now timestamped with fractional seconds.
  * --debug is passed along to git-annex-shell when git-annex is in debug mode.
  * Makefile: Pass LDFLAGS, CFLAGS, and CPPFLAGS through ghc and on to
    ld, cc, and cpp.
  * As a result of the Makefile changes, the Debian package is built
    with various hardening options. Although their benefit to a largely
    haskell program is unknown.

git-annex (5.20150812) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Added support for SHA3 hashed keys (in 8 varieties), when git-annex is
    built using the cryptonite library.
  * metadata: Fix reversion introduced in 5.20150727 that caused recursive
    display of metadata to not work.
  * Windows: Fix bug that caused git-annex sync to fail due to missing
    environment variable.
  * Fix setting/setting/viewing metadata that contains unicode or other
    special characters, when in a non-unicode locale.
  * Simplify setup process for a ssh remote. Now it suffices to run git
    remote add, followed by git-annex sync. Now the remote is automatically
    initialized for use by git-annex, where before the git-annex branch had
    to manually be pushed before using git-annex sync. Note that this
    involved changes to git-annex-shell, so if the remote is using an old
    version, the manual push is still needed.
  * git-annex-shell: Don't let configlist auto-init repository when in
    readonly mode.
  * Perform a clean shutdown when --time-limit is reached.
    This includes running queued git commands, and cleanup actions normally
    run when a command is finished.
  * fsck: Commit incremental fsck database when --time-limit is reached.
    Previously, some of the last files fscked did not make it into the
    database when using --time-limit.
  * fsck: Commit incremental fsck database after every 1000 files
    fscked, or every 5 minutes, whichever comes first. Previously,
    commits were made every 1000 files fscked.
  * Linux standalone: Work around problem that prevented it from working
    properly if unpacked into a directory that contains ":" or ";" in its
    name.
  * proxy: Fix proxy git commit of non-annexed files in direct mode. 
  * proxy: If a non-proxied git command, such as git revert
    would normally fail because of unstaged files in the work tree,
    make the proxied command fail the same way.
  * proxy: Fix removal of files deleted by the proxied command.
  * proxy: Fix behavior when run in subdirectory of git repo.
  * Improve Setup.hs file so that cabal copy --destdir works.
    Thanks, Magnus Therning.
  * Tighten dependency on optparse-applicative to 0.11.0.
  * Added back debian/cabal-wrapper, since it still seems needed after all.

    back.
  * init: Detect when the filesystem is crippled such that it ignores

git-annex (5.20150727) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Fix bug that prevented uploads to remotes using new-style chunking
    from resuming after the last successfully uploaded chunk.
  * Switched option parsing to use optparse-applicative. This was a very large
    and invasive change, and may have caused some minor behavior changes to
    edge cases of option parsing. (For example, the metadata command no
    longer accepts the combination of --get and --set, which never actually
    worked.)
  * Bash completion file is now included in the git-annex source tree, 
    and installed into Debian package (and any other packages built using make
    install). This bash completion is generated by the option parser, so it
    covers all commands, all options, and will never go out of date!
  * As well as tab completing "git-annex" commands, "git annex" will also tab
    complete. However, git's bash completion script needs a patch,
    which I've submitted, for this to work prefectly.
  * version --raw now works when run outside a git repository.
  * assistant --startdelay now works when run outside a git repository.
  * dead now accepts multiple --key options.
  * addurl now accepts --prefix and --suffix options to adjust the
    filenames used.
  * sync --content: Fix bug that caused files to be uploaded to eg,
    more archive remotes than wanted copies, only to later be dropped
    to satisfy the preferred content settings.
  * importfeed: Improve detection of known items whose url has changed,
    and avoid adding redundant files. Where before this only looked at
    permalinks in rss feeds, it now also looks at guids.
  * importfeed: Look at not only permalinks, but now also guids
    to identify previously downloaded files.
  * Webapp: Now features easy setup of git-annex repositories on gitlab.com.
  * Adjust debian build deps: The webapp can now build on arm64, s390x
    and hurd-i386. WebDAV support is also available on those architectures.
  * Debian package now maintained by Richard Hartmann.
  * Support building without persistent database on for systems that
    lack TH. This removes support for incremental fsck.

  * add: Stage symlinks the same as git add would, even if they are not a
    link to annexed content.
  * sync: When annex.autocommit=false, avoid making any commit of local
    changes, while still merging with remote to the extent possible.
  * unused: --used-refspec can now be configured to look at refs in the
    reflog. This provides a way to not consider old versions of files to be
    unused after they have reached a specified age, when the old refs in
    the reflog expire.
  * log: Fix reversion introduced in version 5.20150528 that broke this command.
  * assistant --autostart: First stop any daemons that are already running,
    which might be left over from a previous login session and so unable to
    use the ssh agent of a new login session.
  * assistant: Fix local pairing to not include newline in ssh pubkey,
    which is rejected on the other end for security reasons.
  * assistant: Fix ANNEX_SHELL_DIR written to ~/.ssh/authorized_keys 
    in local pairing to be the absolute path to the repository, not "."
    This was a reversion caused by the relative path changes in 5.20150113.
  * Brought back the setkey plumbing command that was removed in 2011, since
    we found a use case for it. Note that the command's syntax was changed
    for consistency.
  * bugfix: Pass --full-tree when using git ls-files to get a list of files
    on the git-annex branch, so it works when run in a subdirectory.
    This bug affected git-annex unused, and potentially also transitions
    running code and other things.
  * Support git's undocumented core.sharedRepository=2 value, which
    is equivalent to "world", and is set when a repo was created using
    git init --shared=world.
  * When building on linux, pass --as-needed to linker to avoid linking
    with unused shared libraries including libyaml.
  * import: Fix failure of cross-device import on Windows.
  * merge: Avoid creating the synced/master branch.
  * Removed support for optparse-applicative versions older than 0.10.

git-annex (5.20150617) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Now supports git annex sync --all --content to sync all versions of all
    files with all repos that want them.
  * Added new "anything" preferred content expression, which matches all
    versions of all files.
  * Standard preferred content for client, backup, incremental backup,
    and unwanted groups have been adjusted to work better when used
    with git annex sync --all --content.
  * fromkey, registerurl: Improve handling of urls that happen to also
    be parsable as strange keys.
  * sync, remotedaemon: Pass configured ssh-options even when
    annex.sshcaching is disabled.
  * assistant: Consume systemd-networkd dbus events to learn about
    changes to network connections, as was already done with
    network-manager and wicd.
    Thanks to Sebastian Reuße for the patches.
  * get --incomplete: New option to resume any interrupted downloads.
  * dead --key: Can be used to mark a key as dead.
  * fsck: Ignore keys that are known to be dead when running in
    --all/--unused/--key mode or a in a bare repo. Closes: #753888
    Otherwise, still reports files with lost contents, even if the content
    is dead.
  * S3: Special remotes can be configured with public=yes to allow
    the public to access the bucket's content.
  * S3: Publically accessible buckets can be used without creds.
  * import --clean-duplicates: Fix bug that didn't count local or trusted
    repo's copy of a file as one of the necessary copies to allow removing
    it from the import location.
  * tahoe: Use ~/.tahoe-git-annex/ rather than ~/.tahoe/git-annex/
    when setting up a tahoe special remote to avoid old versions of
    tahoe create-client choking.
  * Fix bug that prevented enumerating locally present objects in repos
    tuned with annex.tune.objecthash1=true.
    Fixes: unused, object count in info, unannex.
  * Improve url parsing to handle some urls containing illegal []
    characters in their paths.
  * info: Added json output for "backend usage", "numcopies stats",
    "repositories containing these files", and "transfers in progress".
  * Fix incremental backup standard preferred content expression to match
    its documentation, which says it does not want files that have reached
    a backup repository.
  * Increased the default annex.bloomaccuracy from 1000 to 10000000.
    This makes git annex unused use up to 16 mb more memory than it did
    before, but the massive increase in accuracy makes this worthwhile
    for all but the smallest systems.
  * Build documentation with deterministic=1 for reproducible builds.
    (A new ikiwiki feature.) Closes: #785736
  * Re-remove dependency on obsolete hamlet package. Closes: #786659
  * debian/cabal-wrapper: Removed this hack which should not be needed anymore.

    the file is now moved to the bad directory, and the fsck proceeds.
    Before, the fsck immediately failed.
  * Linux standalone: The webapp was not built in the previous release,
    this release fixes that oversight.

git-annex (5.20150522) unstable; urgency=medium

  * import: Refuse to import files that are within the work tree, as that
    does not make sense and could cause data loss.
  * drop: Now supports --all, --unused, and --key.
  * drop: Now defaults to --all when run in a bare repository.
    (Previously, did nothing when run in a bare repository.)
  * get, move, copy, mirror: Concurrent transfers are now supported!
    For example: git-annex get -J10
    However, progress bars are not yet displayed for concurrent transfers,
    pending an updated version of the ascii-progress library.
  * --quiet now makes progress output by rsync, wget, etc be quiet too.
  * Take space that will be used by other running downloads into account when
    checking annex.diskreserve.
  * Avoid accumulating transfer failure log files unless the assistant is
    being used.
  * Fix an unlikely race that could result in two transfers of the same key
    running at once.
  * Stale transfer lock and info files will be cleaned up automatically
    when get/unused/info commands are run.
  * unused: Add --used-refspec option and annex.used-refspec, which can
    specify a set of refs to consider used, rather than the default of
    considering all refs used.
  * webapp: Fix zombie xdg-open process left when opening file browser.
    Closes: #785498
  * Safer posix fctnl locking implementation, using lock pools and STM.
  * Build documentation with TZ=UTC for reproducible builds. See #785736.
  * OSX: Corrected the location of trustedkeys.gpg, so the built-in
    upgrade code will find it. Fixes OSX upgrade going forward, but
    older versions won't upgrade themselves due to this problem.
  * Remove dependency on obsolete hamlet package. Closes: #786659

git-annex (5.20150508) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Improve behavior when a git-annex command is told to operate
    on a file that doesn't exist. It will now continue to other
    files specified after that on the command line, and only error out at
    the end.
  * S3: Enable debug logging when annex.debug or --debug is set.
  * S3: git annex info will show additional information about a S3 remote
    (endpoint, port, storage class)
  * S3: Let git annex enableremote be used, without trying to recreate
    a bucket that should already exist.
  * S3: Fix incompatibility with bucket names used by hS3; the aws library
    cannot handle upper-case bucket names. git-annex now converts them to
    lower case automatically.
  * import: Check for gitignored files before moving them into the tree.
    (Needs git 1.8.4 or newer.)
  * import: Don't stop entire import when one file fails due to being
    gitignored or conflicting with something in the work tree.
  * import: Before removing a duplicate file in --deduplicate or
    --clean-duplicates mode, verify that enough copies of its content still
    exist.
  * Improve integration with KDE's file manager to work with dolphin
    version 14.12.3 while still being compatable with 4.14.2.
    Thanks, silvio.
  * assistant: Added --autostop to complement --autostart.
  * Work around wget bug #784348 which could cause it to clobber git-annex
    symlinks when downloading from ftp.
  * Support checking ftp urls for file presence.
  * Fix bogus failure of fsck --fast.
  * fsck: Ignore error recording the fsck in the activity log,
    which can happen when running fsck in a read-only repository.
    Closes: #698559
    (fsck can still need to write to the repository if it find problems,
    but a successful fsck can be done read-only)
  * Improve quvi 0.4 output parsing to handle cases wher there is no known
    filename extension. This is currently the case when using quvi with
    youtube. In this case, the extension ".m" will be used.
  * Dropped support for older versions of yesod, warp, and dbus than the ones
    in Debian Jessie.
  * Switch from the obsolete dataenc library for base64 encoding to sandi.
    (Thanks, Magnus Therning)
  * Debian's ghc now supports TH on arm! Adjust build dependencies
    to build the webapp on arm, and enable DAV support on arm. \o/
  * Adjust some other arch specific build dependencies that are now
    available on more architectures in Devian unstable.
  * Windows: Remove cygwin ssh, the newer version of which has stopped
    honoring the setting of HOME. Instead, copy msysgit's ssh into PATH.
    Note that setting up a remote ssh server using password authentication
    is known to be broken in this release on Windows.
  * Windows: Roll back to an older version of rsync from cygwin.
    The newer version has some dependency on a newer ssh from cygwin.

git-annex (5.20150420) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Fix activity log parsing, which caused the log to not retain
    activity from other uuids.
  * Union merge could fall over if there was a file in the repository
    with the same name as a git ref. Now fixed.
  * info dir: Added information about repositories that
    contain files in the specified directory.
  * info: Added --bytes option.
  * bittorrent: Fix handling of magnet links.
  * When a key's size is unknown, still check the annex.diskreserve,
    and avoid getting content if the disk is too full.
  * Fix fsck --from a git remote in a local directory, and from
    a directory special remote.
    This was a reversion caused by the relative path changes in 5.20150113.
  * fsck --from remote: When bad content is found in the remote,
    and the local repo does not have a copy of the content, preserve
    the bad content in .git/annex/bad/ to avoid further data loss.
  * fsck --from remote: Avoid downloading a key if it would go over
    the annex.diskreserve limit.
  * required: New command, like wanted, but for required content.
  * Removed dependency on haskell SHA library,
    instead using cryptohash >= 0.11.0.
  * Make repo init more robust.
  * New debian/rules build-standalone target, which generates a
    git-annex-standalone.deb that should work on many old Debian etc
    systems. Thanks, Yaroslav Halchenko.
  * Windows: Renamed start menu file to avoid loop in some versions
    of Windows where the menu file is treated as a git-annex program.
  * Windows: Fixed support of remotes on other drives.
    (A reversion introduced in version 5.20150113.)
  * Windows: Bundled versions of rsync, wget, ssh, and gpg from
    cygwin all updated. Thanks, Yury V. Zaytsev.

git-annex (5.20150409) unstable; urgency=medium

  * This fixes a bug in the assistant introduced by the literal pathspec
    changes in version 5.20150406.
  * --quiet now suppresses progress displays from eg, rsync.
    (Second time's the charm..)
  * fromkey, registerurl: When reading from stdin, allow the
    filename and url, respectively, to contain whitespace.
  * add: If annex.largefiles is set and does not match a file that's being
    added, the file will be checked into git rather than being added to the
    annex. Previously, git annex add skipped over such files; this new
    behavior is more useful in direct mode.
  * proxy: Made it work when run in a new repository before initial
    commit.
  * info: Display repository mode: bare when in a bare (non-direct mode)
    repo.
  * importfeed: Fix feed download when curl is used.
  * importfeed: Error out when passed a non-url.
  * webapp: When adding another local repository, and combining it
    with the current repository, the new repository's remote path
    was set to "." rather than the path to the current repository.
    This was a reversion caused by the relative path changes in 5.20150113.
  * contentlocationn: New plumbing command.

  * Prevent git-ls-files from double-expanding wildcards when an
    unexpanded wildcard is passed to a git-annex command like add or find.
  * Fix make build target. Thanks, Justin Geibel.
  * Fix GETURLS in external special remote protocol to strip
    downloader prefix from logged url info before checking for the
    specified prefix.
  * importfeed: Avoid downloading a redundant item from a feed whose
    permalink has been seen before, even when the url has changed.
  * importfeed: Always store itemid in metadata; before this was only
    done when annex.genmetadata was set.
  * Relax debian package dependencies to git >= 1:1.8.1 rather
    than needing >= 1:2.0.
  * test: Fix --list-tests
  * addurl --file: When used with a special remote that claims
    urls and checks their contents, don't override the user's provided
    filename with filenames that the special remote suggests. Also,
    don't allow adding the url if the special remote says it contains
    multiple files.
  * import: --deduplicate and --cleanduplicates now output the keys
    corresponding to duplicated files they process.
  * expire: New command, for expiring inactive repositories.
  * fsck: Record fsck activity for use by expire command.
  * Fix truncation of parameters that could occur when using xargs git-annex.
  * Significantly sped up processing of large numbers of directories
    passed to a single git-annex command.
  * version: Add --raw
  * init: Improve fifo test to detect NFS systems that support fifos
    but not well enough for sshcaching.
  * --quiet now suppresses progress displays from eg, rsync.
    (The option already suppressed git-annex's own built-in progress
    displays.)

git-annex (5.20150327) unstable; urgency=medium

  * readpresentkey: New plumbing command for checking location log.
  * checkpresentkey: New plumbing command to check if a key can be verified
    to be present on a remote.
  * Added a post-update-annex hook, which is run after the git-annex branch
    is updated. Needed for git update-server-info.
  * migrate: --force will force migration of keys already using the
    destination backend. Useful in rare cases.
  * Man pages for individual commands now available, and can be
    opened using "git annex help <command>"
  * --auto is no longer a global option; only get, drop, and copy
    accept it. (Not a behavior change unless you were passing it to a
    command that ignored it.)
  * Improve error message when --in @date is used and there is no
    reflog for the git-annex branch.
  * assistant: Committing a whole lot of files at once could overflow
    command-line length limits and cause the commit to fail. This
    only happened when using the assistant in an indirect mode repository.
  * Work around curl bug when asked to download an empty url to a file.
  * Fix bug introduced in the last release that broke git-annex sync
    when git-annex was installed from the standalone tarball.

git-annex (5.20150317) unstable; urgency=medium

  * fsck: Incremental fsck uses sqlite to store its records, instead
    of abusing the sticky bit. Existing sticky bits are ignored;
    incremental fscks started by old versions won't be resumed by
    this version.
  * fsck: Multiple incremental fscks of different repos (including remotes)
    can now be running at the same time in the same repo without it
    getting confused about which files have been checked for which remotes.
  * unannex: Refuse to unannex when repo is too new to have a HEAD,
    since in this case there must be staged changes in the index
    (if there is anything to unannex), and the unannex code path
    needs to run with a clean index.
  * Linux standalone: Set LOCPATH=/dev/null to work around
    https://ghc.haskell.org/trac/ghc/ticket/7695
    This prevents localization from working, but git-annex
    is not localized anyway.
  * sync: As well as the synced/git-annex push, attempt a
    git-annex:git-annex push, as long as the remote branch
    is an ancestor of the local branch, to better support bare git repos.
    (This used to be done, but it forgot to do it since version 4.20130909.)
  * When re-execing git-annex, use current program location, rather than
    ~/.config/git-annex/program, when possible.
  * Submodules are now supported by git-annex!
  * metadata: Fix encoding problem that led to mojibake when storing
    metadata strings that contained both unicode characters and a space
    (or '!') character.
  * Also potentially fixes encoding problem when embedding credentials
    that contain unicode characters.
  * sync: Fix committing when in a direct mode repo that has no HEAD ref.
    (For example, a newly checked out git submodule.)
  * Added SETURIPRESENT and SETURIMISSING to external special remote protocol,
    useful for things like ipfs that don't use regular urls.
  * addurl: Added --raw option, which bypasses special handling of quvi,
    bittorrent etc urls.
  * git-annex-shell: Improve error message when the specified repository
    doesn't exist or git config fails for some reason.
  * fromkey --force: Skip test that the key has its content in the annex.
  * fromkey: Add stdin mode.
  * registerurl: New plumbing command for mass-adding urls to keys.
  * remotedaemon: Fixed support for notifications of changes to gcrypt
    remotes, which was never tested and didn't quite work before.

  * glacier: Detect when the glacier command in PATH is the wrong one,
    from boto, rather than from glacier-cli, and refuse to use it,
    since the boto program fails to fail when passed
    parameters it does not understand.
  * groupwanted: New command to set the groupwanted preferred content
    expression.
  * import: Support file matching options such as --exclude, --include, 
    --smallerthan, --largerthan
  * The file matching options are now only accepted by commands that
    can actually use them, instead of by all commands.
  * import: Avoid checksumming file twice when run in the default
    or --duplicate mode.
  * Windows: Fix bug in dropping an annexed file, which
    caused a symlink to be staged that contained backslashes.
  * webapp: Fix reversion in opening webapp when starting it manually
    inside a repository.
  * assistant: Improve sanity check for control characters when pairing.
  * Improve race recovery code when committing to git-annex branch.
  * addurl: Avoid crash if quvi is not installed, when git-annex was
    built with process-1.2
  * bittorrent: Fix mojibake introduced in parsing arai2c progress output.
  * fsck --from: If a download from a remote fails, propagate the failure.
  * metadata: When setting metadata, do not recurse into directories by
    default, since that can be surprising behavior and difficult to recover
    from. The old behavior is available by using --force.
  * sync, assistant: Include repository name in head branch commit message.
  * The ssh-options git config is now used by gcrypt, rsync, and ddar
    special remotes that use ssh as a transport.
  * sync, assistant: Use the ssh-options git config when doing git pull
    and push.
  * remotedaemon: Use the ssh-options git config.
  * Linux standalone: Improved process names of linker shimmed programs.

git-annex (5.20150205) unstable; urgency=medium

  * info: Can now display info about a given uuid.
  * Added to remote/uuid info: Count of the number of keys present
    on the remote, and their size. This is rather expensive to calculate,
    so comes last and --fast will disable it.
  * info remote: Include the date of the last sync with the remote.
  * sync: Added --message/-m option like git commit.
  * remotedaemon: Fix problem that could prevent ssh connections being
    made after two LOSTNET messages were received in a row (perhaps due to
    two different network interfaces being brought down).
  * Fix build failure when wget is not installed.
  * Fix wording of message displayed when unable to get a file that
    is available in untrusted repositories.
  * addurl: When a Content-Disposition header suggests a filename to use,
    addurl will consider using it, if it's reasonable and doesn't conflict
    with an existing file. (--file overrides this)
  * Fix default repository description created by git annex init,
    which got broken by the relative path changes in the last release.
  * init: Repository tuning parameters can now be passed when initializing a
    repository for the first time. For details, see
    http://git-annex.branchable.com/tuning/
  * merge: Refuse to merge changes from a git-annex branch of a repo
    that has been tuned in incompatible ways.
  * Support annex.tune.objecthash1, annex.tune.objecthashlower, and
    annex.tune.branchhash1.
  * Remove support for building without cryptohash.
  * Added MD5 and MD5E backends.
  * assistant: Fix local pairing when ssh pubkey comment contains spaces.
  * Avoid using fileSize which maxes out at just 2 gb on Windows.
    Instead, use hFileSize, which doesn't have a bounded size.
    Fixes support for files > 2 gb on Windows.
  * Windows: Fix running of the pre-commit-annex hook.

  * Avoid re-checksumming when migrating from hash to hashE backend.
    Closes: #774494
  * Fix build with process 1.2.1.0.
  * Android: Provide a version built with -fPIE -pie to support Android 5.0.
  * sync: Fix an edge case where syncing in a bare repository would try to
    merge and so fail.
  * Check git version at runtime, rather than assuming it will be the same
    as the git version used at build time when running git-checkattr and
    git-branch remove.
  * Switch to using relative paths to the git repository.
    - This allows the git repository to be moved while git-annex is running in
      it, with fewer problems.
    - On Windows, this avoids some of the problems with the absurdly small
      MAX_PATH of 260 bytes. In particular, git-annex repositories should
      work in deeper/longer directory structures than before.
  * Generate shorter keys for WORM and URL, avoiding keys that are longer
    than used for SHA256, so as to not break on systems like Windows that
    have very small maximum path length limits.
  * Bugfix: A file named HEAD in the work tree could confuse some git commands
    run by git-annex.

    *.torrent urls.
  * Use wget -q --show-progress for less verbose wget output,
    when built with wget 1.16.
  * Added bittorrent special remote.
  * addurl behavior change: When downloading an url ending in .torrent,
    it will download files from bittorrent, instead of the old behavior
    of adding the torrent file to the repository.
  * Added Recommends on aria2.
  * When possible, build with the haskell torrent library for parsing
    torrent files. As a fallback, can instead use btshowmetainfo from

  * Add undo action to nautilus and konqueror integration.
  * diffdriver: New git-annex command, to make git external diff drivers
    work with annexed files.
  * pre-commit: Block partial commit of unlocked annexed file, since
    that left a typechange staged in index due to some infelicity of git's
    handling of partial commits.
  * Work around behavior change in lsof 4.88's -F output format.
  * S3: Switched to using the haskell aws library.
  * S3: No longer buffers entire files in memory when uploading without
    chunking.
  * S3: When built with a new enough version of the haskell aws library,
    supports doing multipart uploads, in order to store extremely large
    files in S3 when not using chunking.
  * Don't show "(gpg)" when decrypting the remote encryption cipher,

git-annex (5.20140919) unstable; urgency=high

  * Security fix for S3 and glacier when using embedcreds=yes with
    encryption=pubkey or encryption=hybrid. CVE-2014-6274
    The creds embedded in the git repo were *not* encrypted.
    git-annex enableremote will warn when used on a remote that has
    this problem. For details, see:
    https://git-annex.branchable.com/upgrades/insecure_embedded_creds/
  * assistant: Detect when repository has been deleted or moved, and
    automatically shut down the assistant. Closes: #761261
  * Windows: Avoid crashing trying to list gpg secret keys, for gcrypt
    which is not yet supported on Windows.
  * WebDav: Fix enableremote crash when the remote already exists.
    (Bug introduced in version 5.20140817.)
  * add: In direct mode, adding an annex symlink will check it into git,
    as was already done in indirect mode.

git-annex (5.20140915) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New annex.hardlink setting. Closes: #758593
  * init: Automatically detect when a repository was cloned with --shared,
    and set annex.hardlink=true, as well as marking the repository as
    untrusted.
  * Fix parsing of ipv6 address in git remote address when it was not
    formatted as an url.
  * The annex-rsync-transport configuration is now also used when checking
    if a key is present on a rsync remote, and when dropping a key from
    the remote.
  * Promote file not found warning message to an error.
  * Fix transfer lock file FD leak that could occur when two separate
    git-annex processes were both working to perform the same set of
    transfers.
  * sync: Ensure that pending changes to git-annex branch are committed
    before push when in direct mode. (Fixing a very minor reversion.)
  * WORM backend: Switched to include the relative path to the file inside
    the repository, rather than just the file's base name. Note that if you're
    relying on such things to keep files separate with WORM, you should really
    be using a better backend.
  * Rather than crashing when there's a problem with the requested bloomfilter
    capacity/accuracy, fall back to a reasonable default bloom filter size.
  * Fix build with optparse-applicative 0.10. Closes: #761484
  * webapp: Fixed visual glitch in xmpp pairing that was reported live by a
    user who tracked me down in front of a coffee cart in Portland.

  * New chunk= option to chunk files stored in special remotes.
    Supported by: directory, S3, webdav, gcrypt, rsync, and all external
    and hook special remotes.
  * Partially transferred files are automatically resumed when using
    chunked remotes!
  * The old chunksize= option is deprecated. Do not use for new remotes.
  * Legacy code for directory remotes using the old chunksize= option
    will keep them working, but more slowly than before.
  * webapp: Automatically install Konqueror integration scripts
    to get and drop files.
  * repair: Removing bad objects could leave fsck finding no more
    unreachable objects, but some branches no longer accessible.
    Fix this, including support for fixing up repositories that
    were incompletely repaired before.
  * Fix cost calculation for non-encrypted remotes.
  * Display exception message when a transfer fails due to an exception.
  * WebDAV: Sped up by avoiding making multiple http connections
    when storing a file.
  * WebDAV: Avoid buffering whole file in memory when uploading and
    downloading.
  * WebDAV: Dropped support for DAV before 1.0.
  * testremote: New command to test uploads/downloads to a remote.
  * Dropping an object from a bup special remote now deletes the git branch
    for the object, although of course the object's content cannot be deleted
    due to the nature of bup.
  * unlock: Better error handling; continue past files that are not available
    or cannot be unlocked due to disk space, and try all specified files.
  * Windows: Now uses actual inode equivilants in new direct mode
    repositories, for safer detection of eg, renaming of files with the same
    size and mtime.
  * direct: Fix ugly warning messages.
  * WORM backend: When adding a file in a subdirectory, avoid including the
    subdirectory in the key name.
  * S3, Glacier, WebDAV: Fix bug that prevented accessing the creds
    when the repository was configured with encryption=shared embedcreds=yes.
  * direct: Avoid leaving file content in misctemp if interrupted.
  * git-annex-shell sendkey: Don't fail if a remote asks for a key to be sent
    that already has a transfer lock file indicating it's being sent to that
    remote. The remote may have moved between networks, or reconnected.
  * Switched from the old haskell HTTP library to http-conduit.

  * direct: Fix handling of case where a work tree subdirectory cannot
    be written to due to permissions.
  * migrate: Avoid re-checksumming when migrating from hashE to hash backend.
  * uninit: Avoid failing final removal in some direct mode repositories
    due to file modes.
  * S3: Deal with AWS ACL configurations that do not allow creating or
    checking the location of a bucket, but only reading and writing content to
    it.
  * resolvemerge: New plumbing command that runs the automatic merge conflict
    resolver.
  * Deal with change in git 2.0 that made indirect mode merge conflict
    resolution leave behind old files.
  * sync: Fix git sync with local git remotes even when they don't have an
    annex.uuid set. (The assistant already did so.)
  * Set gcrypt-publish-participants when setting up a gcrypt repository,
    to avoid unncessary passphrase prompts.
    This is a security/usability tradeoff. To avoid exposing the gpg key
    ids who can decrypt the repository, users can unset
    gcrypt-publish-participants.
  * Install nautilus hooks even when ~/.local/share/nautilus/ does not yet
    exist, since it is not automatically created for Gnome 3 users.
  * Windows: Move .vbs files out of git\bin, to avoid that being in the
    PATH, which caused some weird breakage. (Thanks, divB)
  * Windows: Fix locking issue that prevented the webapp starting
    (since 5.20140707).

  * assistant: Fix one-way assistant->assistant sync in direct mode.
  * Fix bug in annex.queuesize calculation that caused much more
    queue flushing than necessary.
  * importfeed: When annex.genmetadata is set, metadata from the feed
    is added to files that are imported from it.
  * Support users who have set commit.gpgsign, by disabling gpg signatures
    for git-annex branch commits and commits made by the assistant.
  * Fix memory leak when committing millions of changes to the git-annex
    branch, eg after git-annex add has run on 2 million files in one go.
  * Support building with bloomfilter 2.0.0.
  * Run standalone install process when the assistant is started
    (was only being run when the webapp was opened).
  * Android: patch git to avoid fchmod, which fails on /sdcard.
  * Windows: Got rid of that pesky DOS box when starting the webapp.
  * Windows: Added Startup menu item so assistant starts automatically
    on login.
  * Windows: Fix opening file browser from webapp when repo is in a
    directory with spaces.

  * Avoid leaving behind .tmp files when failing in some cases, including
    importing files to a disk that is full.
  * Avoid bad commits after interrupted direct mode sync (or merge).
  * Fix build with wai 0.3.0.
  * Deal with FAT's low resolution timestamps, which in combination with
    Linux's caching of higher res timestamps while a FAT is mounted, caused
    direct mode repositories on FAT to seem to have modified files after
    they were unmounted and remounted.
  * Windows: Fix opening webapp when repository is in a directory with
    spaces in the path.
  * Detect when Windows has lost its mind in a timezone change, and
    automatically apply a delta to the timestamps it returns, to get back to
    sane values.

  * assistant: Make sanity checker tmp dir cleanup code more robust.
  * unused: Avoid checking view branches for unused files.
  * webapp: Include ssh port in mangled hostname.

  * Fix encoding of data written to git-annex branch. Avoid truncating
    unicode characters to 8 bits. Allow any encoding to be used, as with
    filenames (but utf8 is the sane choice). Affects metadata and repository
    descriptions, and preferred content expressions.
  * assistant: When there are multiple remotes giving different ways
    to access the same repository, honor remote cost settings and use
    the cheapest available.
  * webapp: More robust startup when annex directory is not a git repo.
  * initremote/enableremote: Basic support for using with regular git remotes;
    initremote stores the location of an already existing git remote,
    and enableremote setups up a remote using its stored location.
  * webapp: Support for enabling known git repositories on ssh servers.
    The repository must have been added using initremote.
  * webapp: When setting up a ssh remote, record it using initremote,
    so that it can be easily enabled elsewhere.
  * webapp: When setting up a ssh remote, if the user inputs ~/foo,
    normalize that to foo, since it's in the home directory by default.
  * Use exceptions in place of deprecated MonadCatchIO-transformers
    Thanks, Ben Gamari.
  * android: Run busybox install with -s, since some versions of Android
    prohibit making hard links.
  * Android webapp: Fix EvilSplicer bugs that mangled the css files,
    preventing icons from displaying, and also slightly broke the js files.

  * assistant: Now detects immediately when other repositories push
    changes to a ssh remote, and pulls.
    ** XMPP is no longer needed in this configuration! **
    This requires the remote server have git-annex-shell with
    notifychanges support (>= 5.20140405)
  * webapp: Show a network signal icon next to ssh and xmpp remotes that
    it's currently connected with.
  * webapp: Rework xmpp nudge to prompt for either xmpp or a ssh remote 
    to be set up.
  * sync, assistant, remotedaemon: Use ssh connection caching for git pushes
    and pulls.
  * remotedaemon: When network connection is lost, close all cached ssh
    connections.
  * Improve handling of monthly/yearly scheduling.
  * Avoid depending on shakespeare except for when building the webapp.
  * uninit: Avoid making unncessary copies of files.
  * info: Allow use in a repository where annex.uuid is not set.
  * reinit: New command that can initialize a new repository using
    the configuration of a previously known repository.
    Useful if a repository got deleted and you want
    to clone it back the way it was.
  * drop --from: When local repository is untrusted, its copy of a file does
    not count.
  * Bring back rsync -p, but only when git-annex is running on a non-crippled
    file system. This is a better approach to fix #700282 while not
    unncessarily losing file permissions on non-crippled systems.
  * webapp: Start even if the current directory is listed in
    ~/.config/git-annex/autostart but no longer has a git repository in it.
  * findref: New command, like find but shows files in a specified git ref.
  * webapp: Fix UI for removing XMPP connection.
  * When init detects that git is not configured to commit, and sets
    user.email to work around the problem, also make it set user.name.
  * webapp: Support using git-annex on a remote server, which was installed
    from the standalone tarball or OSX app, and so does not have
    git-annex in PATH (and may also not have git or rsync in PATH).
  * standalone tarball, OSX app: Install a ~/.ssh/git-annex-wrapper, which

    runaway loop. Thanks to Anarcat for his assistance, and to Maximiliano
    Curia for identifying the cause of this bug.

  * tahoe: Pass -d parameter before subcommand; putting it after
    the subcommand no longer works with tahoe-lafs version 1.10.
    (Thanks, Alberto Berti)
  * forget --drop-dead: Avoid removing the dead remote from the trust.log,
    so that if git remotes for it still exist anywhere, git annex info
    will still know it's dead and not show it.
  * git-annex-shell: Make configlist automatically initialize
    a remote git repository, as long as a git-annex branch has
    been pushed to it, to simplify setup of remote git repositories,
    including via gitolite.
  * add --include-dotfiles: New option, perhaps useful for backups.
  * Version 5.20140227 broke creation of glacier repositories,
    not including the datacenter and vault in their configuration.
    This bug is fixed, but glacier repositories set up with the broken
    version of git-annex need to have the datacenter and vault set
    in order to be usable. This can be done using git annex enableremote
    to add the missing settings. For details, see

  * copy --fast --to remote: Avoid printing anything for files that
    are already believed to be present on the remote.
  * Commands that allow specifying which repository to act on using

    match, rather than picking a repository at random.
    (So will --in=)
  * Better workaround for problem umasks when eg, setting up ssh keys.
  * "standard" can now be used as a first-class keyword in preferred content
    expressions. For example "standard or (include=otherdir/*)"
  * groupwanted can be used in preferred content expressions.

    to any of a file's metadata.
  * unused: In direct mode, files that are deleted from the work tree
    and so have no content present are no longer incorrectly detected as
    unused.
  * Avoid encoding errors when using the unused log file.
  * map: Fix crash when one of the remotes of a repo is a local directory
    that does not exist, or is not a git repo.

    using !tag and field!=value.
  * vadd: Allow listing multiple desired values for a field.

  * metadata: Field names limited to alphanumerics and a few whitelisted
    punctuation characters to avoid issues with views, etc.
  * metadata: Field names are now case insensative.
  * When constructing views, metadata is available about the location of the
    file in the view's reference branch. Allows incorporating parts of the
    directory hierarchy in a view.
    For example `git annex view tag=* podcasts/=*` makes a view in the form
    tag/showname.
  * --metadata field=value can now use globs to match, and matches

  * --in can now refer to files that were located in a repository at
    some past date. For example, --in="here@{yesterday}"
  * Fixed direct mode annexed content locking code, which is used to
    guard against recursive file drops.
  * This is the first beta-level release of the Windows port with important
    fixes (see below).
    (The webapp and assistant are still alpha-level on Windows.)
  * sync --content: Honor annex-ignore configuration.
  * sync: Don't try to sync with xmpp remotes, which are only currently
    supported when using the assistant.
  * sync --content: Re-pull from remotes after downloading content,
    since that can take a while and other changes may be pushed in the
    meantime.
  * sync --content: Reuse smart copy code from copy command, including
    handling and repairing out of date location tracking info.
    Closes: #737480
  * sync --content: Drop files from remotes that don't want them after
    getting them.
  * sync: Fix bug in automatic merge conflict resolution code when used
    on a filesystem not supporting symlinks, which resulted in it losing
    track of the symlink bit of annexed files.
  * Added ways to configure rsync options to be used only when uploading
    or downloading from a remote. Useful to eg limit upload bandwidth.
  * Fix initremote with encryption=pubkey to work with S3, glacier, webdav,
    and external special remotes.
  * Avoid building with DAV 0.6 which is badly broken (see #737902).
  * Fix dropping of unused keys with spaces in their name.
  * Fix build on platforms not supporting the webapp.
  * Document in man page that sshcaching uses ssh ControlMaster.
    Closes: #737476
  * Windows: It's now safe to run multiple git-annex processes concurrently
    on Windows; the lock files have been sorted out.
  * Windows: Avoid using unix-compat's rename, which refuses to rename
    directories.
  * Windows: Fix deletion of repositories by test suite and webapp.
  * Windows: Test suite 100% passes again.
  * Windows: Fix bug in symlink calculation code.
  * Windows: Fix handling of absolute unix-style git repository paths.
  * Android: Avoid crashing when unable to set file mode for ssh config file
    due to Android filesystem horribleness.

    transferred. Similar to the assistant, this honors any configured
    preferred content expressions.
  * Remove --json option from commands not supporting it.
  * status: Support --json.
  * list: Fix specifying of files to list.
  * Allow --all to be mixed with matching options like --copies and --in
    (but not --include and --exclude).
  * numcopies: New command, sets global numcopies value that is seen by all
    clones of a repository.
  * The annex.numcopies git config setting is deprecated. Once the numcopies
    command is used to set the global number of copies, any annex.numcopies
    git configs will be ignored.
  * assistant: Make the prefs page set the global numcopies.
  * Add lackingcopies, approxlackingcopies, and unused to
    preferred content expressions.
  * Client, transfer, incremental backup, and archive repositories
    now want to get content that does not yet have enough copies.
  * Client, transfer, and source repositories now do not want to retain
    unused file contents.
  * assistant: Checks daily for unused file contents, and when possible
    moves them to a repository (such as a backup repository) that
    wants to retain them.
  * assistant: annex.expireunused can be configured to cause unused
    file contents to be deleted after some period of time.
  * webapp: Nudge user to see if they want to expire old unused file
    contents when a lot of them seem to be piling up in the repository.
  * repair: Check git version at run time.
  * assistant: Run the periodic git gc in batch mode.
  * added annex.secure-erase-command config option.
  * test suite: Use tasty-rerun, and expose tasty command-line options.
  * Optimise non-bare http remotes; no longer does a 404 to the wrong
    url every time before trying the right url. Needs annex-bare to be
    set to false, which is done when initially probing the uuid of a
    http remote.
  * webapp: After upgrading a git repository to git-annex, fix
    bug that made it temporarily not be synced with.
  * whereis: Support --all.
  * All commands that support --all also support a --key option,
    which limits them to acting on a single key.

    git checkout -B
  * map: Fix display of v5 direct mode repos.
  * repair: Support old git versions from before git fsck --no-dangling was
    implemented.
  * Fix a long-standing bug that could cause the wrong index file to be used
    when committing to the git-annex branch, if GIT_INDEX_FILE is set in the
    environment. This typically resulted in git-annex branch log files being
    committed to the master branch and later showing up in the work tree.
    (These log files can be safely removed.)
  * assistant: Detect if .git/annex/index is corrupt at startup, and
    recover.
  * repair: Fix bug in packed refs file exploding code that caused a .gitrefs
    directory to be created instead of .git/refs

    SETSTATE, GETSTATE, DEBUG.
  * Windows: Fix bug in direct mode merge code that could cause files
    in subdirectories to go missing.
  * Windows: Avoid eating stdin when running ssh to add a authorized key,
    since this is used for password prompting.
  * Avoid looping if long-running git cat-file or git hash-object crashes
    and keeps crashing when restarted.
  * Assistant: Remove stale MERGE_HEAD files in lockfile cleanup.
  * Remotes can now be made read-only, by setting remote.<name>.annex-readonly
  * wanted, schedule: Avoid printing "ok" after requested value.
  * assistant: Ensure that .ssh/config and .ssh/authorized_keys are not
    group or world writable when writing to those files, as that can make
    ssh refuse to use them, if it allows another user to write to them.
  * addurl, importfeed: Honor annex.diskreserve as long as the size of the
    url can be checked.
  * add: Fix rollback when disk is completely full.
  * assistant: Fixed several minor memory leaks that manifested when
    adding a large number of files.
  * assistant: Start a new git-annex transferkeys process
    after a network connection change, so that remotes that use a persistent
    network connection are restarted.
  * Adjust Debian build deps to match current state of sparc, mipsel.

    (tasty was stuck in incoming.)
  * Fix typo in test suite.
  * Fix bug in Linux standalone build's shimming that broke git-annex-shell.
  * Include git-receive-pack, git-upload-pack, git, and git-shell wrappers
    in the Linux standalone build, and OSX app, so they will be available
    when it's added to PATH.
  * addurl, importfeed: Sanitize | and some other symbols and special
    characters.
  * Auto-upgrade v3 indirect repos to v5 with no changes.
    This also fixes a problem when a direct mode repo was somehow set to v3
    rather than v4, and so the automatic direct mode upgrade to v5 was not
    done.
  * Android: Avoid trying to use Android's own ionice, which does not
    allow specifying a command to run. Fixes transferring files to/from
    android and probably a few other things.

    follow symlinks to other directories, and add their contents to the annex.
  * assistant: Set StrictHostKeyChecking yes when creating ssh remotes,
    and add it to the configuration for any ssh remotes previously created
    by the assistant. This avoids repeated prompts by ssh if the host key
    changes, instead syncing with such a remote will fail. Closes: #732602
  * Fix test suite to cover lock --force change.
  * Add plumbing-level lookupkey and examinekey commands.
  * find --format: Added hashdirlower, hashdirmixed, keyname, and mtime
    format variables.
  * assistant: Always batch changes found in startup scan.
  * An armel Linux standalone build is now available, which includes the
    webapp.
  * Programs from Linux and OSX standalone builds can now be symlinked
    into a directory in PATH as an alternative installation method, and will
    use readlink to find where the build was unpacked.
  * Include man pages in Linux and OSX standalone builds.
  * Linux standalone build now includes its own glibc and forces the linker to
    use it, to remove dependence on the host glibc.

    it will read the full contents of files in the tree.
  * assistant: Batch jobs are now run with ionice and nocache, when
    those commands are available.
  * assistant: Run transferkeys as batch jobs.
  * Automatically fix up bad bare repositories created by
    versions 5.20131118 through 5.20131127.
  * rsync special remote: Fix fallback mode for rsync remotes that

  * repair: Remove damaged git-annex sync branches.
  * status: Ignore new files that are gitignored.
  * Fix direct mode's handling when modifications to non-annexed files
    are pulled from a remote. A bug prevented the files from being updated

  * assistant: Detect when the git-annex binary is modified or replaced,

  * annex.autoupgrade configures both the above upgrade behaviors.
  * Added support for quvi 0.9. Slightly suboptimal due to limitations in its
    interface compared with the old version.
  * Bug fix: annex.version did not get set on automatic upgrade to v5 direct
    mode repo, so the upgrade was performed repeatedly, slowing commands down.
  * webapp: Fix bug that broke switching between local repositories
    that use the new guarded direct mode.
  * Android: Fix stripping of the git-annex binary.
  * Android: Make terminal app show git-annex version number.
  * Android: Re-enable XMPP support.

  * annex.version is now set to 5 for direct mode repositories.
    This upgrade is handled fully automatically, no need to run
    git annex upgrade
  * The "status" command has been renamed to "info", to allow
    "git annex status" to be used in direct mode repositories, now that
    "git status" won't work in them.
  * The -c option now not only modifies the git configuration seen by
    git-annex, but it is passed along to every git command git-annex runs.
  * watcher: Avoid loop when adding a file owned by someone else fails
    in indirect mode because its permissions cannot be modified.
  * webapp: Avoid encoding problems when displaying the daemon log file.
  * webapp: Improve UI around remote that have no annex.uuid set,
    either because setup of them is incomplete, or because the remote
    git repository is not a git-annex repository.

  * assistant: Notice on startup when the index file is corrupt, and
    auto-repair.
  * Fix direct mode merge bug when a direct mode file was deleted and replaced
    with a directory. An ordering problem caused the directory to not get
    created in this case.
    Thanks to Tim for the test case.
  * Direct mode .git/annex/objects directories are no longer left writable,
    because that allowed writing to symlinks of files that are not present,

    without such a file, so files can still be retreived from them.
  * assistant: Automatically repair damanged git repository, if it can
    be done without losing data.
  * assistant: Support repairing git remotes that are locally accessible
    (eg, on removable drives).
  * add: Fix reversion in 4.20130827 when adding unlocked files that have
    not yet been committed.
  * unannex: New, much slower, but more safe behavior: Copies files out of
    the annex. This avoids an unannex of one file breaking other files that
    link to the same content. Also, it means that the content
    remains in the annex using up space until cleaned up with 
    "git annex unused".
    (The behavior of unannex --fast has not changed; it still hard links
    to content in the annex. --fast was not made the default because it is
    potentially unsafe; editing such a hard linked file can unexpectedly
    change content stored in the annex.)

    .git/annex/index.lock files, which would prevent git from
    committing to the git-annex branch, eg after a crash.
  * assistant: Detect stale git lock files at startup time, and remove them.
  * addurl: Better sanitization of generated filenames.
  * Better sanitization of problem characters when generating URL and WORM
    keys.
  * The control socket path passed to ssh needs to be 17 characters
    shorter than the maximum unix domain socket length, because ssh

  * sync: Fix automatic resolution of merge conflicts where one side is an
    annexed file, and the other side is a non-annexed file, or a directory.
  * S3: Try to ensure bucket name is valid for archive.org.
  * assistant: Bug fix: When run in a subdirectory, files from incoming merges

  * Disable receive.denyNonFastForwards when setting up a gcrypt special
    remote, since gcrypt needs to be able to fast-forward the master branch.
  * import: Preserve top-level directory structure.
  * Use cryptohash rather than SHA for hashing when no external hash program
    is available. This is a significant speedup for SHA256 on OSX, for

  * Added SKEIN256 and SKEIN512 backends.
  * Android build redone from scratch, many dependencies updated,
    and entire build can now be done using provided scripts.
  * assistant: Clear the list of failed transfers when doing a full transfer

  * Added gcrypt support. This combines a fully encrypted git
    repository (using git-remote-gcrypt) with an encrypted git-annex special
    remote.
  * sync: Support syncing with gcrypt remotes.
  * importfeed: Also ignore transient problems with downloading content
    from feeds.
  * Honor core.sharedrepository when receiving and adding files in direct
    mode.
  * enableremote: gpg keys can be removed from those a remote encrypts
    to by passing "keyid-=$KEYID". keyid+= is also provided.
    (Thanks, guilhem for the patch.)
  * Added encryption=pubkey scheme, which encrypts to public keys directly
    rather than the hybrid approach. See documentation for advantages
    and disadvantages, but encryption=hybrid is the recommended scheme still.
    (Thanks, guilhem for the patch.)
  * Fix Feeds display in build flags.
  * Remind user when annex-ignore is set for some remotes, if unable to
    get or drop a file, possibly because it's on an ignored remote.
  * gpg: Force --no-textmode in case the user has it turned on in config.
  * webapp: Improve javascript's handling of longpolling connection
    failures, by reloading the current page in this case.
    Works around chromium behavior where ajax connections to urls
    that were already accessed are denied after navigating back to
    a previous page.
  * Allow building without quvi support.

  * Youtube support! (And 53 other video hosts). When quvi is installed,
    git-annex addurl automatically uses it to detect when an page is
    a video, and downloads the video file.
  * web special remote: Also support using quvi, for getting files,
    or checking if files exist in the web.
  * unused: Is now a minimum of 30 times faster, and typically many
    more times than that (when a repository has several branches).
    (Thanks, guilhem for the patch.)
  * unused: Fix bugs in two edge cases involving manually staged changes.
    (Thanks, guilhem for the patch.)
  * Android: Fix bug in terminal app that caused it to spin using much 
    CPU and battery. This problem was introduced in version 4.20130601.
  * sync, merge: Bug fix: Don't try to merge into master when in a bare repo.
  * import: Add options to control handling of duplicate files:
    --duplicate, --deduplicate, and --clean-duplicates
  * mirror: New command, makes two repositories contain the same set of files.
  * Set --clobber when running wget to ensure resuming works properly.
  * Unescape characters in 'file://...' URIs. (Thanks, guilhem for the patch.)
  * Better error message when trying to use a git remote that has annex.ignore
    set.
  * Fix bug that caused typechanged symlinks to be assumed to be unlocked
    files, so they were added to the annex by the pre-commit hook.
  * Debian: Run the builtin test suite as an autopkgtest.
  * Debian: Recommend ssh-askpass, which ssh will use when the assistant
    is run w/o a tty. Closes: #719832

git-annex (4.20130802) unstable; urgency=low

  * dropunused behavior change: Now refuses to drop the last copy of a
    file, unless you use the --force.
    This was the last place in git-annex that could remove data referred
    to by the git history, without being forced.
    Like drop, dropunused checks remotes, and honors the global
    annex.numcopies setting. (However, .gitattributes settings cannot
    apply to unused files.) 
  * Fix inverted logic in last release's fix for data loss bug,
    that caused git-annex sync on FAT or other crippled filesystems to add
    symlink standin files to the annex.
  * importfeed can be used to import files from podcast feeds.
  * webapp: When setting up a dedicated ssh key to access the annex
    on a host, set IdentitiesOnly to prevent the ssh-agent from forcing
    use of a different ssh key. That could result in unncessary password
    prompts, or prevent git-annex-shell from being run on the remote host.
  * webapp: Improve handling of remotes whose setup has stalled.
  * Add status message to XMPP presence tag, to identify to others that
    the client is a git-annex client. Closes: #717652
  * webapp: When creating a repository on a removable drive, set
    core.fsyncobjectfiles, to help prevent data loss when the drive is yanked.
  * Always build with -threaded, to avoid a deadlock when communicating with
    gpg.
  * unused: No longer shows as unused tmp files that are actively being
    transferred.
  * assistant: Fix NetWatcher to not sync with remotes that have
    remote.<name>.annex-sync set to false.
  * assistant: Fix deadlock that could occur when adding a lot of files
    at once in indirect mode.
  * assistant: Fix bug that caused it to stall when adding a very large
    number of files at once (around 5 thousand).
  * OSX: Make git-annex-webapp run in the background, so that the app icon
    can be clicked on the open a new webapp when the assistant is already
    running.
  * Improve test suite on Windows; now tests git annex sync.
  * Fix a few bugs involving filenames that are at or near the filesystem's
    maximum filename length limit.
  * find: Avoid polluting stdout with progress messages. Closes: #718186
  * Escape ':' in file/directory names to avoid it being treated
    as a pathspec by some git commands. Closes: #718185
  * Slow and ugly work around for bug #718517 in git 1.8.4~rc0, which broke
    git-cat-file --batch for filenames containing spaces.
    (Will be reverted after next git pre-release fixes the problem.)

  * Fix data loss bug when adding an (uncompressed) tarball of a
    git-annex repository, or other file that begins with something
    that can be mistaken for a git-annex link. Closes: #717456
  * New improved version of the git-annex logo, contributed by
    John Lawrence.
  * Rsync.net have committed to support git-annex and offer a special
    discounted rate for git-annex users. Updated the webapp to reflect this.
    http://www.rsync.net/products/git-annex-pricing.html
  * Install XDG desktop icon files.
  * Support unannex and uninit in direct mode.
  * Support import in direct mode.
  * webapp: Better display of added files.
  * fix: Preserve the original mtime of fixed symlinks.
  * uninit: Preserve .git/annex/objects at the end, if it still
    has content, so that old versions of files and deleted files
    are not deleted. Print a message with some suggested actions.
  * When a transfer is already being run by another process,
    proceed on to the next file, rather than dying.
  * Fix checking when content is present in a non-bare repository
    accessed via http.
  * Display byte sizes with more precision.
  * watcher: Fixed a crash that could occur when a directory was renamed
    or deleted before it could be scanned.
  * watcher: Partially worked around a bug in hinotify, no longer crashes
    if hinotify cannot process a directory (but can't detect changes in it)
  * directory special remote: Fix checking that there is enough disk space
    to hold an object, was broken when using encryption.
  * webapp: Differentiate between creating a new S3/Glacier/WebDav remote,
    and initializing an existing remote. When creating a new remote, avoid
    conflicts with other existing (or deleted) remotes with the same name.
  * When an XMPP server has SRV records, try them, but don't then fall
    back to the regular host if they all fail.
  * For long hostnames, use a hash of the hostname to generate the socket
    file for ssh connection caching.

git-annex (4.20130709) unstable; urgency=low

  * --all: New switch that makes git-annex operate on all data stored
    in the git annex, including old versions of files. Supported by
    fsck, get, move, copy.
  * --unused: New switch that makes git-annex operate on all data found
    by the last run of git annex unused. Supported by fsck, move, copy.
  * get, move, copy: Can now be run in a bare repository,
    like fsck already could. --all is enabled automatically in this case.
  * merge: Now also merges synced/master or similar branches, which 
    makes it useful to put in a post-receive hook to make a repository
    automatically update its working copy when git annex sync or the assistant
    sync with it.
  * webapp: Fix ssh setup with nonstandard port, broken in last release.
  * init: Detect systems on which git commit fails due to not being able to
    determine the FQDN, and put in a workaround so committing to the git-annex
    branch works.
  * addurl --pathdepth: Fix failure when the pathdepth specified is deeper
    than the urls's path.
  * Windows: Look for .exe extension when searching for a command in path.
  * Pass -f to curl when downloading a file with it, so it propigates failure. 
  * Windows: Fix url to object when using a http remote.
  * webapp: Fix authorized_keys line added when setting up a rsync remote
    on a server that also supports git-annex, to not force running
    git-annex-shell.
  * OSX Mountain Lion: Fixed gpg bundled in dmg to not fail due to a missing
    gpg-agent.
  * Android: gpg is built without --enable-minimal, so it interoperates
    better with other gpg builds that may default to using other algorithms
    for encryption.
  * dropunused, addunused: Complain when asked to operate on a number that
    does not correspond to any unused key.
  * fsck: Don't claim to fix direct mode when run on a symlink whose content
    is not present.
  * Make --numcopies override annex.numcopies set in .gitattributes.

  * webapp: Fix bug when setting up a remote ssh repo repeatedly on the same
    server.
  * webapp: Ensure that ssh keys generated for different directories
    on a server are always different.
  * webapp: Fix bug setting up ssh repo if the user enters "~/" at the start 
    of the path.
  * assistant: Fix bug that prevented adding files written by gnucash,

  * Supports indirect mode on encfs in paranoia mode, and other
    filesystems that do not support hard links, but do support
    symlinks and other POSIX filesystem features.
  * Android: Add .thumbnails to .gitignore when setting up a camera
    repository.
  * Android: Make the "Open webapp" menu item open the just created
    repository when a new repo is made.
  * webapp: When the user switches to display a different repository,
    that repository becomes the default repository to be displayed next time
    the webapp gets started.
  * glacier: Better handling of the glacier inventory, which avoids
    duplicate uploads to the same glacier repository by `git annex copy`.
  * Direct mode: No longer temporarily remove write permission bit of files
    when adding them.
  * sync: Better support for bare git remotes. Now pushes directly to the
    master branch on such a remote, instead of to synced/master. This
    makes it easier to clone from a bare git remote that has been populated
    with git annex sync or by the assistant.
  * Android: Fix use of cp command to not try to use features present
    only on build system.
  * Windows: Fix hang when adding several files at once.
  * assistant: In direct mode, objects are now only dropped when all
    associated files are unwanted. This avoids a repreated drop/get loop
    of a file that has a copy in an archive directory, and a copy not in an
    archive directory. (Indirect mode still has some buggy behavior in this
    area, since it does not keep track of associated files.)
    Closes: #712060
  * status: No longer shows dead repositories.
  * annex.debug can now be set to enable debug logging by default.
    The webapp's debugging check box does this.
  * fsck: Avoid getting confused by Windows path separators
  * Windows: Multiple bug fixes, including fixing the data written to the
    git-annex branch.
  * Windows: The test suite now passes on Windows (a few broken parts are
    disabled).
  * assistant: On Linux, the expensive transfer scan is run niced.
  * Enable assistant and WebDAV support on powerpc and sparc architectures,
    which now have the necessary dependencies built.

  * XMPP: Avoid redundant and unncessary pushes. Note that this breaks
    compatibility with previous versions of git-annex, which will refuse
    to accept any XMPP pushes from this version.
  * XMPP: Send pings and use them to detect when contact with the server
    is lost.
  * hook special remote: Added combined hook program support.
  * Android app: Avoid using hard links to app's lib directory, which
    is sometimes on a different filesystem than the data directory.
  * Fix bug in parsing of parens in some preferred content expressions.
    This fixes the behavior of the manual mode group.
  * assistant: Work around git-cat-file's not reloading the index after files
    are staged.
  * Improve error handling when getting uuid of http remotes to auto-ignore,

  * Temporarily build without webapp on kfreebsd-i386, until yesod is
    installable there again.
  * Direct mode bug fix: After a conflicted merge was automatically resolved,
    the content of a file that was already present could incorrectly
    be replaced with a symlink.
  * Fix a bug in the git-annex branch handling code that could
    cause info from a remote to not be merged and take effect immediately.
  * Direct mode is now fully tested by the test suite.
  * Detect bad content in ~/.config/git-annex/program and look in PATH instead.

  * Android: The webapp is ported and working.
  * Windows: There is a very rough Windows port. Do not trust it with
    important data.
  * git-annex-shell: Ensure that received files can be read. Files
    transferred from some Android devices may have very broken permissions
    as received.
  * direct mode: Direct mode commands now work on files staged in the index,
    they do not need to be committed to git.
  * Temporarily add an upper bound to the version of yesod that can be built
    with, since yesod 1.2 has a great many changes that will require extensive
    work on the webapp.
  * Disable building with the haskell threaded runtime when the assistant
    is not built. This may fix builds on s390x and sparc, which are failing
    to link -lHSrts_thr
  * Avoid depending on regex-tdfa on mips, mipsel, and s390, where it fails
    to build.
  * direct: Fix a bug that could cause some files to be left in indirect mode.
  * When initializing a directory special remote with a relative path,
    the path is made absolute.
  * SHA: Add a runtime sanity check that sha commands output something
    that appears to be a real sha.
  * configure: Better checking that sha commands output in the desired format.
  * rsync special remotes: When sending from a crippled filesystem, use
    the destination's default file permissions, as the local ones can
    be arbitrarily broken. (Ie, ----rwxr-x for files on Android)
  * migrate: Detect if a file gets corrupted while it's being migrated.

  * assistant: Work around misfeature in git 1.8.2 that makes
    `git commit --alow-empty -m ""` run an editor.
  * sync: Bug fix, avoid adding to the annex the 
    dummy symlinks used on crippled filesystems.
  * Add public repository group.
    (And inpreferreddir to preferred content expressions.)
  * webapp: Can now set up Internet Archive repositories.
  * S3: Dropping content from the Internet Archive doesn't work, but
    their API indicates it does. Always refuse to drop from there.
  * Automatically register public urls for files uploaded to the
    Internet Archive.
  * To enable an existing special remote, the new enableremote command
    must be used. The initremote command now is used only to create
    new special remotes.
  * initremote: If two existing remotes have the same name,
    prefer the one with a higher trust level.
  * assistant: Improved XMPP protocol to better support multiple repositories
    using the same XMPP account. Fixes bad behavior when sharing with a friend
    when you or the friend have multiple reposotories on an XMPP account.
    Note that XMPP pairing with your own devices still pairs with all
    repositories using your XMPP account.
  * assistant: Fix bug that could cause incoming pushes to not get
    merged into the local tree. Particularly affected XMPP pushes.
  * webapp: Display some additional information about a repository on
    its edit page.
  * webapp: Install FDO desktop menu file when started in standalone mode.
  * webapp: Don't default to making repository in cwd when started
    from within a directory containing a git-annex file (eg, standalone
    tarball directory).
  * Detect systems that have no user name set in GECOS, and also
    don't have user.name set in git config, and put in a workaround
    so that commits to the git-annex branch (and the assistant)
    will still succeed despite git not liking the system configuration.
  * webapp: When told to add a git repository on a remote server, and
    the repository already exists as a non-bare repository, use it,
    rather than initializing a bare repository in the same directory.
  * direct, indirect: Refuse to do anything when the assistant
    or git-annex watch daemon is running.
  * assistant: When built with git before 1.8.0, use `git remote rm`
    to delete a remote. Newer git uses `git remote remove`.
  * rmurl: New command, removes one of the recorded urls for a file.
  * Detect when the remote is broken like bitbucket is, and exits 0 when
    it fails to run git-annex-shell.
  * assistant: Several improvements to performance and behavior when
    performing bulk adds of a large number of files (tens to hundreds
    of thousands).
  * assistant: Sanitize XMPP presence information logged for debugging.
  * webapp: Now automatically fills in any creds used by an existing remote
    when creating a new remote of the same type. Done for Internet Archive,

    This can be disabled using --fast to get the old behavior.
    The assistant still uses low-quality entropy when creating encrypted
    remotes, to avoid delays. (Thanks, guilhem for the patch.)
  * Bugfix: Direct mode no longer repeatedly checksums duplicated files.
  * assistant: Work around horrible, terrible, very bad behavior of
    gnome-keyring, by not storing special-purpose ssh keys in ~/.ssh/*.pub.
    Apparently gnome-keyring apparently will load and indiscriminately use
    such keys in some cases, even if they are not using any of the standard
    ssh key names. Instead store the keys in ~/.ssh/annex/,
    which gnome-keyring will not check.
  * addurl: Bugfix: Did not properly add file in direct mode.
  * assistant: Bug fix to avoid annexing the files that git uses
    to stand in for symlinks on FAT and other filesystem not supporting
    symlinks.
  * Adjust preferred content expressions so that content in archive
    directories is preferred until it has reached an archive or smallarchive
    repository.
  * webapp: New --listen= option allows running the webapp on one computer
    and connecting to it from another. (Note: Does not yet use HTTPS.)
  * Added annex.web-download-command setting.
  * Added per-remote annex-rsync-transport option. (guilhem again)
  * Ssh connection caching is now also used by rsync special remotes.

  * assistant: Stop any transfers the assistant initiated on shutdown.
  * assistant: Added sequence numbers to XMPP git push packets. (Not yet used.)
  * addurl: Register transfer so the webapp can see it.
  * addurl: Automatically retry downloads that fail, as long as some
    additional content was downloaded.
  * webapp: Much improved progress bar display for downloads from encrypted
    remotes.
  * Avoid using runghc, as that needs ghci.
  * webapp: When a repository's group is changed, rescan for transfers.
  * webapp: Added animations.
  * webapp: Include the repository directory in the mangled hostname and
    ssh key name, so that a locked down ssh key for one repository is not
    re-used when setting up additional repositories on the same server.
  * Fall back to internal url downloader when built without curl.
  * fsck: Check content of direct mode files (only when the inode cache

git-annex (4.20130314) unstable; urgency=low

  * Bugfix: git annex add, when ran without any file or directory specified,
    should add files in the current directory, but not act on unlocked files
    elsewhere in the tree.
  * Bugfix: drop --from an unavailable remote no longer updates the location
    log, incorrectly, to say the remote does not have the key.
  * Bugfix: If the UUID of a remote is not known, prevent --from, --to,
    and other ways of specifying remotes by name from selecting it,
    since it is not possible to sanely use it.
  * Bugfix: Fix bug in inode cache sentinal check, which broke
    copying to local repos if the repo being copied from had moved
    to a different filesystem or otherwise changed all its inodes

  * Switch from using regex-compat to regex-tdfa, as the C regex library
    is rather buggy.
  * status: Can now be run with a directory path to show only the
    status of that directory, rather than the whole annex.
  * Added remote.<name>.annex-gnupg-options setting.
    Thanks, guilhem for the patch.
  * addurl: Add --relaxed option.
  * addurl: Escape invalid characters in urls, rather than failing to
    use an invalid url.
  * addurl: Properly handle url-escaped characters in file:// urls.

  * assistant: Fix dropping content when a file is moved to an archive
    directory, and getting contennt when a file is moved back out.
  * assistant: Fix bug in direct mode that could occur when a symlink is
    moved out of an archive directory, and resulted in the file not being
    set to direct mode when it was transferred.
  * assistant: Generate better commits for renames.
  * assistant: Logs are rotated to avoid them using too much disk space.
  * assistant: Avoid noise in logs from git commit about typechanged
    files in direct mode repositories.
  * assistant: Set gc.auto=0 when creating repositories to prevent
    automatic commits from causing git-gc runs.
  * assistant: If gc.auto=0, run git-gc once a day, packing loose objects
    very non-aggressively.
  * assistant: XMPP git pull and push requests are cached and sent when
    presence of a new client is detected.
  * assistant: Sync with all git remotes on startup.
  * assistant: Get back in sync with XMPP remotes after network reconnection,
    and on startup.
  * assistant: Fix syncing after XMPP pairing.
  * assistant: Optimised handling of renamed files in direct mode,
    avoiding re-checksumming.
  * assistant: Detects most renames, including directory renames, and
    combines all their changes into a single commit.
  * assistant: Fix ~/.ssh/git-annex-shell wrapper to work when the
    ssh key does not force a command.
  * assistant: Be smarter about avoiding unncessary transfers.

  * webapp: Work around bug in Warp's slowloris attack prevention code,
    that caused regular browsers to stall when they reuse a connection
    after leaving it idle for 30 seconds.
    (See https://github.com/yesodweb/wai/issues/146)
  * webapp: New preferences page allows enabling/disabling debug logging
    at runtime, as well as configuring numcopies and diskreserve.
  * webapp: Repository costs can be configured by dragging repositories around
    in the repository list.
  * webapp: Proceed automatically on from "Configure jabber account"
    to pairing.
  * webapp: Only show up to 10 queued transfers.
  * webapp: DTRT when told to create a git repo that already exists.

    network remotes.

  * Run ssh with -T to avoid tty allocation and any login scripts that
    may do undesired things with it.
  * Several improvements to Makefile and cabal file. Thanks, Peter Simmons
  * Stop depending on testpack.
  * Android: Enable test suite.

    always using git's pseudosymlink files in such repositories.
  * webapp: Allow creating repositories on filesystems that lack support for
    symlinks.
  * webapp: Can now add a new local repository, and make it sync with
    the main local repository.
  * Android: Bundle now includes openssh.
  * Android: Support ssh connection caching.
  * Android: Assistant is fully working. (But no webapp yet.)
  * Direct mode: Support filesystems like FAT which can change their inodes
    each time they are mounted.
  * Direct mode: Fix support for adding a modified file.
  * Avoid passing -p to rsync, to interoperate with crippled filesystems.
    Closes: #700282
  * Additional GIT_DIR support bugfixes. May actually work now.
  * webapp: Display any error message from git init if it fails to create
    a repository.
  * Fix a reversion in matching globs introduced in the last release,
    where "*" did not match files inside subdirectories. No longer uses
    the Glob library.
  * copy: Update location log when no copy was performed, if the location
    log was out of date.
  * Makefile now builds using cabal, taking advantage of cabal's automatic
    detection of appropriate build flags.
  * test: The test suite is now built into the git-annex binary, and can
    be run at any time.

git-annex (3.20130216) unstable; urgency=low

  * Now uses the Haskell uuid library, rather than needing a uuid program.
  * Now uses the Haskell Glob library, rather than pcre-light, avoiding
    the need to install libpcre. Currently done only for Cabal or when
    the Makefile is made to use -DWITH_GLOB
  * Android port now available (command-line only).
  * New annex.crippledfilesystem setting, allows use of git-annex
    repositories on FAT and even worse filesystems; avoiding use of
    hard links and locked down permissions settings. (Support is incomplete.)
  * init: Detect when the repository is on a filesystem that does not
    support hard links, or symlinks, or unix permissions, and set
    annex.crippledfilesystem, as well as annex.direct.
  * add: Improved detection of files that are modified while being added.
  * Fix a bug in direct mode, introduced in the previous release, where
    if a file was dropped and then got back, it would be stored in indirect
    mode.

git-annex (3.20130207) unstable; urgency=low

  * webapp: Now allows restarting any threads that crash.
  * Adjust debian package to only build-depend on DAV on architectures
    where it is available.
  * addurl --fast: Use curl, rather than haskell HTTP library, to support https.
  * annex.autocommit: New setting, can be used to disable autocommit
    of changed files by the assistant, while it still does data syncing
    and other tasks.
  * assistant: Ignore .DS_Store on OSX.
  * assistant: Fix location log when adding new file in direct mode.
  * Deal with stale mappings for deleted file in direct mode.
  * pre-commit: Update direct mode mappings.

    mode.
  * Clean up direct mode cache and mapping info when dropping keys.
  * dropunused: Clean up stale direct mode cache and mapping info not
    removed before.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Thu, 07 Feb 2013 12:45:25 -0400

git-annex (3.20130124) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added source repository group, that only retains files until they've
    been transferred to another repository. Useful for things like
    repositories on cameras.
  * Added manual repository group. Use to prevent the assistant from
    downloading any file contents to keep things in sync. Instead
    `git annex get`, `git annex drop` etc can be used manually as desired.
  * webapp: More adjustments to longpoll code to deal with changes in
    variable quoting in different versions of shakespeare-js.
  * webapp: Avoid an error if a transfer is stopped just as it finishes.
    Closes: #698184 
  * webapp: Now always logs to .git/annex/daemon.log
  * webapp: Has a page to view the log, accessed from the control menu.
  * webapp: Fix crash adding removable drive that has an annex directory
    in it that is not a git repository.
  * Deal with incompatibility in gpg2, which caused prompts for encryption
    passphrases rather than using the supplied --passphrase-fd.
  * bugfix: Union merges involving two or more repositories could sometimes
    result in data from one repository getting lost. This could result
    in the location log data becoming wrong, and fsck being needed to fix it.
  * sync: Automatic merge conflict resolution now stages deleted files.
  * Depend on git 1.7.7.6 for --no-edit. Closes: #698399
  * Fix direct mode mapping code to always store direct mode filenames
    relative to the top of the repository, even when operating inside a
    subdirectory.
  * fsck: Detect and fix consistency errors in direct mode mapping files.
  * Avoid filename encoding errors when writing direct mode mappings.

git-annex (3.20130114) unstable; urgency=low

  * Now handles the case where a file that's being transferred to a remote
    is modified in place, which direct mode allows. When this
    happens, the transfer now fails, rather than allow possibly corrupt
    data into the remote.
  * fsck: Better checking of file content in direct mode.
  * drop: Suggest using git annex move when numcopies prevents dropping a file.
  * webapp: Repo switcher filters out repos that do not exist any more
    (or are on a drive that's not mounted).
  * webapp: Use IP address, rather than localhost, since some systems may
    have configuration problems or other issues that prevent web browsers
    from connecting to the right localhost IP for the webapp.
  * webapp: Adjust longpoll code to work with recent versions of
    shakespeare-js.
  * assistant: Support new gvfs dbus names used in Gnome 3.6.
  * In direct mode, files with the same key are no longer hardlinked, as
    that would cause a surprising behavior if modifying one, where the other
    would also change.
  * webapp: Avoid illegal characters in hostname when creating S3 or
    Glacier remote.
  * assistant: Avoid committer crashing if a file is deleted at the wrong
    instant.

  * webapp: Add UI to stop and restart assistant.
  * committer: Fix a file handle leak.
  * assistant: Make expensive transfer scan work fully in direct mode.
  * More commands work in direct mode repositories: find, whereis, move, copy,
    drop, log, fsck, add, addurl.
  * sync: No longer automatically adds files in direct mode.
  * assistant: Detect when system is not configured with a user name,
    and set environment to prevent git from failing.
  * direct: Avoid hardlinking symlinks that point to the same content
    when the content is not present.
  * Fix transferring files to special remotes in direct mode.

git-annex (3.20130102) unstable; urgency=low

  * direct, indirect: New commands, that switch a repository to and from
    direct mode. In direct mode, files are accessed directly, rather than
    via symlinks. Note that direct mode is currently experimental. Many
    git-annex commands do not work in direct mode. Some git commands can
    cause data loss when used in direct mode repositories.
  * assistant: Now uses direct mode by default when setting up a new
    local repository.
  * OSX assistant: Uses the FSEvents API to detect file changes.
    This avoids issues with running out of file descriptors on large trees,
    as well as allowing detection of modification of files in direct mode.
    Other BSD systems still use kqueue.
  * kqueue: Fix bug that made broken symlinks not be noticed.
  * vicfg: Quote filename. Closes: #696193
  * Bugfix: Fixed bug parsing transfer info files, where the newline after
    the filename was included in it. This was generally benign, but in
    the assistant, it caused unexpected dropping of preferred content.
  * Bugfix: Remove leading \ from checksums output by sha*sum commands,
    when the filename contains \ or a newline. Closes: #696384
  * fsck: Still accept checksums with a leading \ as valid, now that
    above bug is fixed.
  * SHA*E backends: Exclude non-alphanumeric characters from extensions.
  * migrate: Remove leading \ in SHA* checksums, and non-alphanumerics
    from extensions of SHA*E keys.

  * Include ssh in standalone tarball and OSX app.
  * watch: Avoid leaving hard links to files behind in .git/annex/tmp
    if a file is deleted or moved while it's being quarantined in preparation
    to being added to the annex.
  * Allow `git annex drop --from web`; of course this does not remove
    any file from the web, but it does make git-annex remove all urls
    associated with a file.
  * webapp: S3 and Glacier forms now have a select list of all
    currently-supported AWS regions.
  * webdav: Avoid trying to set props, avoiding incompatibility with
    livedrive.com. Needs DAV version 0.3.

    when preferred content settings want it.
  * drop --auto: Fix dropping content when there are no preferred content
    settings.
  * webapp: Allow user to specify the port when setting up a ssh or rsync
    remote.
  * assistant: Fix syncing to just created ssh remotes.
  * Enable WebDAV support in Debian package. Closes: #695532

  * Bugfix: directory special remote could loop forever storing a key 
    when a too small chunksize was configured.
  * Allow controlling whether login credentials for S3 and webdav are
    committed to the repository, by setting embedcreds=yes|no when running
    initremote.
  * Added smallarchive repository group, that only archives files that are
    in archive directories. Used by default for glacier when set up in the
    webapp.
  * assistant: Fixed handling of toplevel archive directory and
    client repository group.
  * assistant: Apply preferred content settings when a new symlink
    is created, or a symlink gets renamed. Made archive directories work.

    does not accept that.
  * bugfix: Don't fail transferring content from read-only repos.
    Closes: #691341
  * configure: Check that checksum programs produce correct checksums.
  * Re-enable dbus, using a new version of the library that fixes the memory
    leak.
  * NetWatcher: When dbus connection is lost, try to reconnect.
  * Use USER and HOME environment when set, and only fall back to getpwent,
    which doesn't work with LDAP or NIS.
  * rsync special remote: Include annex-rsync-options when running rsync

  * webapp: Repository edit form can now edit the name of a repository.
  * webapp: Make bare repositories on removable drives, as there is nothing

  * webapp: Better behavior when pausing syncing to a remote when a transfer
    scan is running and queueing new transfers for that remote.
  * The standalone binaries are now built to not use ssh connection caching,
    in order to work with old versions of ssh.
  * A relative core.worktree is relative to the gitdir. Now that this is
    handled correctly, git-annex can be used in git submodules.
  * Temporarily disable use of dbus, as the haskell dbus library blows up
    when losing connection, which will need to be fixed upstream.

  * Fix fallback to ~/Desktop when xdg-user-dir is not available.
    Closes: #688833
  * S3: When using a shared cipher, S3 credentials are not stored encrypted

  * webapp: An interface for managing and configuring the assistant.
  * The default backend used when adding files to the annex is changed
    from SHA256 to SHA256E, to simplify interoperability with OSX, media
    players, and various programs that needlessly look at symlink targets.
    To get old behavior, add a .gitattributes containing: * annex.backend=SHA256
  * init: If no description is provided for a new repository, one will
    automatically be generated, like "joey@gnu:~/foo"
  * test: Set a lot of git environment variables so testing works in strange
    environments that normally need git config to set names, etc.
    Closes: #682351 Thanks, gregor herrmann
  * Disable ssh connection caching if the path to the control socket would be
    too long (and use relative path to minimise path to the control socket).
  * migrate: Check content before generating the new key, to avoid generating
    a key for corrupt data.
  * Support repositories created with --separate-git-dir. Closes: #684405
  * reinject: When the provided file doesn't match, leave it where it is,
    rather than moving to .git/annex/bad/
  * Avoid crashing on encoding errors in filenames when writing transfer info
    files and reading from checksum commands.
  * sync: Pushes the git-annex branch to remote/synced/git-annex, rather

  * Avoid ugly failure mode when moving content from a local repository
    that is not available.
  * Got rid of the last place that did utf8 decoding.

    annex.rsync-options, annex.bup-split-options. (And adjust types to avoid

  * sync: Sync to lower cost remotes first.
  * status: Fixed to run in constant space.
  * status: More accurate display of sizes of tmp and bad keys.
  * unused: Now uses a bloom filter, and runs in constant space.
    Use of a bloom filter does mean it will not notice a small
    number of unused keys. For repos with up to half a million keys,
    it will miss one key in 1000.
  * Added annex.bloomcapacity and annex.bloomaccuracy, which can be
    adjusted as desired to tune the bloom filter.
  * status: Display amount of memory used by bloom filter, and
    detect when it's too small for the number of keys in a repository.
  * git-annex-shell: Runs hooks/annex-content after content is received
    or dropped.
  * Work around a bug in rsync (IMHO) introduced by openSUSE's SIP patch.
  * git-annex now behaves as git-annex-shell if symlinked to and run by that
    name. The Makefile sets this up, saving some 8 mb of installed size.
  * git-union-merge is a demo program, so it is no longer built by default.

  * Modifications to support ghc 7.4's handling of filenames.
    This version can only be built with ghc 7.4 or newer. See the ghc7.0
    branch for older ghcs.
  * S3: Fix irrefutable pattern failure when accessing encrypted S3
    credentials.
  * Use the haskell IfElse library.
  * Fix teardown of stale cached ssh connections.
  * Fixed to use the strict state monad, to avoid leaking all kinds of memory
    due to lazy state update thunks when adding/fixing many files.
  * Fixed some memory leaks that occurred when committing journal files.
  * Added a annex.queuesize setting, useful when adding hundreds of thousands
    of files on a system with plenty of memory.
  * whereis: Prints the urls of files that the web special remote knows about.
  * addurl --fast: Verifies that the url can be downloaded (only getting
    its head), and records the size in the key.
  * When checking that an url has a key, verify that the Content-Length,
    if available, matches the size of the key.
  * addurl: Added a --file option, which can be used to specify what
    file the url is added to. This can be used to override the default
    filename that is used when adding an url, which is based on the url.
    Or, when the file already exists, the url is recorded as another
    location of the file.
  * addurl: Normalize badly encoded urls.
  * addurl: Add --pathdepth option.
  * rekey: New plumbing level command, can be used to change the keys used
    for files en masse.
  * Store web special remote url info in a more efficient location.
    (Urls stored with this version will not be visible to older versions.)
  * Deal with NFS problem that caused a failure to remove a directory
    when removing content from the annex.
  * Make a single location log commit after a remote has received or
    dropped files. Uses a new "git-annex-shell commit" command when available.
  * To avoid commits of data to the git-annex branch after each command
    is run, set annex.alwayscommit=false. Its data will then be committed
    less frequently, when a merge or sync is done.
  * configure: Check if ssh connection caching is supported by the installed
    version of ssh and default annex.sshcaching accordingly.
  * move --from, copy --from: Now 10 times faster when scanning to find
    files in a remote on a local disk; rather than go through the location log
    to see which files are present on the remote, it simply looks at the 
    disk contents directly.

  * fsck --from: Fscking a remote is now supported. It's done by retrieving
    the contents of the specified files from the remote, and checking them,
    so can be an expensive operation. Still, if the remote is a special
    remote, or a git repository that you cannot run fsck in locally, it's
    nice to have the ability to fsck it.
  * If you have any directory special remotes, now would be a good time to
    fsck them, in case you were hit by the data loss bug fixed in the
    previous release!
  * fsck --from remote --fast: Avoids expensive file transfers, at the
    expense of not checking file size and/or contents.
  * Ssh connection caching is now enabled automatically by git-annex.
    Only one ssh connection is made to each host per git-annex run, which
    can speed some things up a lot, as well as avoiding repeated password
    prompts. Concurrent git-annex processes also share ssh connections.
    Cached ssh connections are shut down when git-annex exits.
  * To disable the ssh caching (if for example you have your own broader
    ssh caching configuration), set annex.sshcaching=false.

  * Dotfiles, and files inside dotdirs are not added by "git annex add"
    unless the dotfile or directory is explicitly listed. So "git annex add ."
    will add all untracked files in the current directory except for those in
    dotdirs.
  * Added quickcheck to build dependencies, and fail if test suite cannot be

    Thanks to Joachim Breitner.
  * Rather than manually committing, pushing, pulling, merging, and git annex
    merging, we encourage you to give "git annex sync" a try.
  * sync --fast: Selects some of the remotes with the lowest annex.cost
    and syncs those, in addition to any specified at the command line.
  * Union merge now finds the least expensive way to represent the merge.
  * reinject: Add a sanity check for using an annexed file as the source file.
  * Properly handle multiline git config values.
  * Fix the hook special remote, which bitrotted a while ago.
  * map: --fast disables use of dot to display map
  * Test suite improvements. Current top-level test coverage: 75%
  * Improve deletion of files from rsync special remotes. Closes: #652849
  * Add --include, which is the same as --not --exclude.
  * Format strings can be specified using the new --format option, to control
    what is output by git annex find.
  * Support git annex find --json
  * Fixed behavior when multiple insteadOf configs are provided for the
    same url base.
  * Can now be built with older git versions (before 1.7.7); the resulting

    for users to check out and commit changes directly to the git-annex

  * map: Fix a failure to detect a loop when both repositories are local
    and refer to each other with relative paths.
  * Prevent key names from containing newlines.
  * add: If interrupted, add can leave files converted to symlinks but not
    yet added to git. Running the add again will now clean up this situtation.
  * Fix caching of decrypted ciphers, which failed when drop had to check
    multiple different encrypted special remotes.
  * unannex: Can be run on files that have been added to the annex, but not

  * status: Now always shows the current repository, even when it does not
    appear in uuid.log.
  * fsck: Now works in bare repositories. Checks location log information,

  * Fix referring to remotes by uuid.
  * New or changed repository descriptions in uuid.log now have a timestamp,
    which is used to ensure the newest description is used when the uuid.log
    has been merged.
  * Note that older versions of git-annex will display the timestamp as part
    of the repository description, which is ugly but otherwise harmless.
  * Add timestamps to trust.log and remote.log too.
  * git-annex-shell: Added the --uuid option.
  * git-annex now asks git-annex-shell to verify that it's operating in 
    the expected repository.
  * Note that this git-annex will not interoperate with remotes using 
    older versions of git-annex-shell.
  * Now supports git's insteadOf configuration, to modify the url
    used to access a remote. Note that pushInsteadOf is not used;
    that and pushurl are reserved for actual git pushes. Closes: #644278
  * status: List all known repositories.
  * When displaying a list of repositories, show git remote names
    in addition to their descriptions.
  * Add locking to avoid races when changing the git-annex branch.
  * Various speed improvements gained by using ByteStrings.
  * Contain the zombie hordes.

  * --in can be used to make git-annex only operate on files
    believed to be present in a given repository.
  * Arbitrarily complex expressions can be built to limit the files git-annex
    operates on, by combining the options --not --and --or -( and -)
    Example: git annex get --exclude '*.mp3' --and --not -( --in usbdrive --or --in archive -)
  * --copies=N can be used to make git-annex only operate on files with
    the specified number of copies. (And --not --copies=N for the inverse.)
  * find: Rather than only showing files whose contents are present,
    when used with --exclude --copies or --in, displays all files that
    match the specified conditions.
  * Note that this is a behavior change for git-annex find! Old behavior
    can be gotten by using: git-annex find --in .
  * status: Massively sped up; remove --fast mode.
  * unused: File contents used by branches and tags are no longer
    considered unused, even when not used by the current branch. This is
    the final piece of the puzzle needed for git-annex to to play nicely
    with branches.

    location count.
  * Fix build without S3.
  * addurl: Always use whole url as destination filename, rather than
    only its file component.

  * The wget command will now be used in preference to curl, if available.
  * init: Make description an optional parameter.
  * unused, status: Sped up by avoiding unnecessary stats of annexed files.
  * unused --remote: Reduced memory use to 1/4th what was used before.

  * Now "git annex init" only has to be run once, when a git repository
    is first being created. Clones will automatically notice that git-annex
    is in use and automatically perform a basic initalization. It's
    still recommended to run "git annex init" in any clones, to describe them.
  * Added annex-cost-command configuration, which can be used to vary the

  * unannex: In --fast mode, file content is left in the annex, and a
    hard link made to it.
  * uninit: Use unannex in --fast mode, to support unannexing multiple
    files that link to the same content.
  * Drop the dependency on the haskell curl bindings, use regular haskell HTTP.

git-annex (3.20110702) unstable; urgency=low

  * Now the web can be used as a special remote. 
    This feature replaces the old URL backend.
  * addurl: New command to download an url and store it in the annex.
  * Sped back up fsck, copy --from, and other commands that often
    have to read a lot of information from the git-annex branch. Such
    commands are now faster than they were before introduction of the
    git-annex branch.
  * Always ensure git-annex branch exists.
  * Modify location log parser to allow future expansion.
  * --force will cause add, etc, to operate on ignored files.
  * Avoid mangling encoding when storing the description of repository
    and other content.
  * cabal can now be used to build git-annex. This is substantially
    slower than using make, does not build or install documentation,
    does not run the test suite, and is not particularly recommended,
    but could be useful to some.

  * New repository format, annex.version=3. Use `git annex upgrade` to migrate.
  * git-annex now stores its logs in a git-annex branch.
  * merge: New subcommand. Auto-merges the new git-annex branch.
  * Improved handling of bare git repos with annexes. Many more commands will
    work in them.
  * git-annex is now more robust; it will never leave state files
    uncommitted when some other git process comes along and locks the index
    at an inconvenient time.
  * rsync is now used when copying files from repos on other filesystems.
    cp is still used when copying file from repos on the same filesystem,
    since --reflink=auto can make it significantly faster on filesystems
    such as btrfs.
  * Allow --trust etc to specify a repository by name, for temporarily 
    trusting repositories that are not configured remotes.
  * unlock: Made atomic.
  * git-union-merge: New git subcommand, that does a generic union merge
    operation, and operates efficiently without touching the working tree.

    limits, disable encryption, support their nonstandard way of creating
    buckets, and allow x-archive-* headers to be specified in initremote to
    set item metadata.
  * Added filename extension preserving variant backends SHA1E, SHA256E, etc.
  * migrate: Use current filename when generating new key, for backends

  * unused: Now also lists files fsck places in .git/annex/bad/
  * S3: When encryption is enabled, the Amazon S3 login credentials
    are stored, encrypted, in .git-annex/remotes.log, so environment

  * bup is now supported as a special type of remote.
  * The data sent to special remotes (Amazon S3, bup, etc) can be encrypted
    using GPG for privacy.
  * Use lowercase hash directories for locationlog files, to avoid
    some issues with git on OSX with the mixed-case directories.
    No migration is needed; the old mixed case hash directories are still
    read; new information is written to the new directories.
  * Unused files on remotes, particulary special remotes, can now be
    identified and dropped, by using "--from remote" with git annex unused
    and git annex dropunused.
  * Clear up short option confusion between --from and --force (-f is now
    --from, and there is no short option for --force).
  * Add build depend on perlmagick so docs are consistently built.
    Closes: #621410
  * Add doc-base file. Closes: #621408
  * Periodically flush git command queue, to avoid boating memory usage

  * fsck: Ensure that files and directories in .git/annex/objects

  * Generalized remotes handling, laying groundwork for remotes that are
    not regular git remotes. (Think Amazon S3.)
  * Provide a less expensive version of `git annex copy --to`, enabled
    via --fast. This assumes that location tracking information is correct,
    rather than contacting the remote for every file.
  * Bugfix: Keys could be received into v1 annexes from v2 annexes, via
    v1 git-annex-shell. This results in some oddly named keys in the v1
    annex. Recognise and fix those keys when upgrading, instead of crashing.

git-annex (0.20110325) experimental; urgency=low

  * Free space checking is now done, for transfers of data for keys
    that have free space metadata. (Notably, not for SHA* keys generated
    with git-annex 0.2x or earlier.) The code is believed to work on
    Linux, FreeBSD, and OSX; check compile-time messages to see if it
    is not enabled for your OS.
  * Add annex.diskreserve config setting, to control how much free space
    to reserve for other purposes and avoid using (defaults to 1 mb).
  * Add --fast flag, that can enable less expensive, but also less thorough
    versions of some commands.
  * fsck: In fast mode, avoid checking checksums.
  * unused: In fast mode, just show all existing temp files as unused,
    and avoid expensive scan for other unused content.
  * migrate: Support migrating v1 SHA keys to v2 SHA keys with
    size information that can be used for free space checking.
  * Fix space leak in fsck and drop commands.
  * migrate: Bugfix for case when migrating a file results in a key that
    is already present in .git/annex/objects.
  * dropunused: Significantly sped up; only read unused log file once.

  * The first time git-annex is run in an old format repository, it
    will automatically upgrade it to the new format, staging all

  * Colons are now avoided in filenames, so bare clones of git repos
    can be put on USB thumb drives formatted with vFAT or similar
    filesystems.
  * Added two levels of hashing to object directory and .git-annex logs,
    to improve scalability with enormous numbers of annexed
    objects. (With one hundred million annexed objects, each
    directory would contain fewer than 1024 files.)
  * The setkey, fromkey, and dropkey subcommands have changed how
    the key is specified. --backend is no longer used with these.

  * Add Suggests on graphviz. Closes: #618039
  * When adding files to the annex, the symlinks pointing at the annexed
    content are made to have the same mtime as the original file.
    While git does not preserve that information, this allows a tool
    like metastore to be used with annexed files.

  * whereis: New subcommand to show where a file's content has gotten to.

    may or may not match locale settings, any attempt to decode filenames 
    will fail for some files. So instead, do all output in binary mode.

git-annex (0.22) unstable; urgency=low

  * Git annexes can now be attached to bare git repositories.
    (Both the local and remote host must have this version of git-annex
    installed for it to work.)
  * Support filenames that start with a dash; when such a file is passed
    to a utility it will be escaped to avoid it being interpreted as an
    option. (I went a little overboard and got the type checker involved
    in this, so such files are rather comprehensively supported now.)
  * New backends: SHA512 SHA384 SHA256 SHA224
    (Supported on systems where corresponding shaNsum commands are available.)
  * describe: New subcommand that can set or change the description of
    a repository.
  * Fix test suite to reap zombies.
    (Zombies can be particularly annoying on OSX; thanks to Jimmy Tang
    for his help eliminating the infestation... for now.)
  * Make test suite not rely on a working cp -pr.
    (The Unix wars are still ON!)
  * Look for dir.git directories the same as git does.
  * Support remote urls specified as relative paths.
  * Support non-ssh remote paths that contain tilde expansions.

  * Preserve specified file ordering when instructed to act on multiple
    files or directories. For example, "git annex get a b" will now always
    get "a" before "b". Previously it could operate in either order.
  * unannex: Commit staged changes at end, to avoid some confusing behavior
    with the pre-commit hook, which would see some types of commits after
    an unannex as checking in of an unlocked file.
  * map: New subcommand that uses graphviz to display a nice map of
    the git repository network.
  * Deal with the mtl/monads-fd conflict.

  * semitrust: Now restores the default trust level. (What untrust used to do.)
  * fsck, drop: Take untrusted repositories into account.
  * Bugfix: Files were copied from trusted remotes first even if their
    annex.cost was higher than other remotes.
  * Improved temp file handling. Transfers of content can now be resumed
    from temp files later; the resume does not have to be the immediate
    next git-annex run.
  * unused: Include partially transferred content in the list.
  * Bugfix: Running a second git-annex while a first has a transfer in

git-annex (0.16) unstable; urgency=low

  * git-annex-shell: Avoid exposing any git repo config except for the
    annex.uuid when doing configlist.
  * bugfix: Running `move --to` with a remote whose UUID was not yet known
    could result in git-annex not recording on the local side where the
    file was moved to. This could not result in data loss, or even a
    significant problem, since the remote *did* record that it had the file.
  * Also, add a general guard to detect attempts to record information
    about repositories with missing UUIDs.
  * bugfix: Running `move --to` with a non-ssh remote failed.
  * bugfix: Running `copy --to` with a non-ssh remote actually did a move.

  * Fix bug in numcopies handling when multiple remotes pointed to the
    same repository.
  * Introduce the git-annex-shell command. It's now possible to make
    a user have it as a restricted login shell, similar to git-shell.
  * Note that git-annex will always use git-annex-shell when accessing
    a ssh remote, so all of your remotes need to be upgraded to this
    version of git-annex at the same time.
  * Now rsync is exclusively used for copying files to and from remotes.
    scp is not longer supported.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Sat, 11 Dec 2010 17:32:00 -0400

git-annex (0.11) unstable; urgency=low

  * If available, rsync will be used for file transfers from remote
    repositories. This allows resuming interrupted transfers.
  * Added remote.annex-rsync-options.
  * Avoid deleting temp files when rsync fails.
  * Improve detection of version 0 repos.
  * Add uninit subcommand. Closes: #605749

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Sat, 04 Dec 2010 17:27:42 -0400

git-annex (0.10) unstable; urgency=low

  * In .gitattributes, the annex.numcopies attribute can be used
    to control the number of copies to retain of different types of files.
  * Bugfix: Always correctly handle gitattributes when in a subdirectory of
    the repository. (Had worked ok for ones like "*.mp3", but failed for
    ones like "dir/*".)
  * fsck: Fix warning about not enough copies of a file, when locations
    are known, but are not available in currently configured remotes.
  * precommit: Optimise to avoid calling git-check-attr more than once.
  * The git-annex-backend attribute has been renamed to annex.backend.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Sun, 28 Nov 2010 19:28:05 -0400

git-annex (0.09) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add copy subcommand.
  * Fix bug in setkey subcommand triggered by move --to.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Sat, 27 Nov 2010 17:14:59 -0400

git-annex (0.08) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix `git annex add ../foo` (when ran in a subdir of the repo).
  * Add configure step to build process.
  * Only use cp -a if it is supported, falling back to cp -p or plain cp
    as needed for portability.
  * cp --reflink=auto is used if supported, and will make git annex unlock
    much faster on filesystems like btrfs that support copy on write.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Sun, 21 Nov 2010 13:45:44 -0400

git-annex (0.07) unstable; urgency=low

  * find: New subcommand.
  * unused: New subcommand, finds unused data. (Split out from fsck.)
  * dropunused: New subcommand, provides for easy dropping of unused keys
    by number, as listed by the unused subcommand.
  * fsck: Print warnings to stderr; --quiet can now be used to only see
    problems.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Mon, 15 Nov 2010 18:41:50 -0400

git-annex (0.06) unstable; urgency=low

  * fsck: Check if annex.numcopies is satisfied.
  * fsck: Verify the sha1 of files when the SHA1 backend is used.
  * fsck: Verify the size of files when the WORM backend is used.
  * fsck: Allow specifying individual files if fscking everything
    is not desired.
  * fsck: Fix bug, introduced in 0.04, in detection of unused data.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Sat, 13 Nov 2010 16:24:29 -0400

git-annex (0.05) unstable; urgency=low

  * Optimize both pre-commit and lock subcommands to not call git diff
    on every file being committed/locked.
    (This actually also works around a bug in ghc, that caused
    git-annex 0.04 pre-commit to sometimes corrupt filename being read
    from git ls-files and fail. 
    See <http://hackage.haskell.org/trac/ghc/ticket/4493>
    The excessive number of calls made by pre-commit exposed the ghc bug.
    Thanks Josh Triplett for the debugging.)
  * Build with -O2.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Thu, 11 Nov 2010 18:31:09 -0400

git-annex (0.04) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add unlock subcommand, which replaces the symlink with a copy of
    the file's content in preparation of changing it. The "edit" subcommand
    is an alias for unlock.
  * Add lock subcommand.
  * Unlocked files will now automatically be added back into the annex when
    committed (and the updated symlink committed), by some magic in the
    pre-commit hook.
  * The SHA1 backend is now fully usable.
  * Add annex.version, which will be used to automate upgrades
    between incompatible versions.
  * Reorganised the layout of .git/annex/
  * The new layout will be automatically upgraded to the first time
    git-annex is used in a repository with the old layout.
  * Note that git-annex 0.04 cannot transfer content from old repositories
    that have not yet been upgraded.
  * Annexed file contents are now made unwritable and put in unwriteable
    directories, to avoid them accidentally being removed or modified.
    (Thanks Josh Triplett for the idea.)
  * Add build dep on libghc6-testpack-dev. Closes: #603016
  * Avoid using runghc to run test suite as it is not available on all
    architectures. Closes: #603006

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Wed, 10 Nov 2010 14:23:23 -0400

git-annex (0.03) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix support for file:// remotes.
  * Add --verbose
  * Fix SIGINT handling.
  * Fix handling of files with unusual characters in their name.
  * Fixed memory leak; git-annex no longer reads the whole file list
    from git before starting, and will be much faster with large repos.
  * Fix crash on unknown symlinks.
  * Added remote.annex-scp-options and remote.annex-ssh-options.
  * The backends to use when adding different sets of files can be configured
    via gitattributes.
  * In .gitattributes, the git-annex-backend attribute can be set to the
    names of backends to use when adding different types of files.
  * Add fsck subcommand. (For now it only finds unused key contents in the
    annex.)

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Sun, 07 Nov 2010 18:26:04 -0400

git-annex (0.02) unstable; urgency=low

  * Can scp annexed files from remote hosts, and check remote hosts for
    file content when dropping files.
  * New move subcommand, that makes it easy to move file contents from
    or to a remote.
  * New fromkey subcommand, for registering urls, etc.
  * git-annex init will now set up a pre-commit hook that fixes up symlinks
    before they are committed, to ensure that moving symlinks around does not
    break them.
  * More intelligent and fast staging of modified files; git add coalescing.
  * Add remote.annex-ignore git config setting to allow completly disabling
    a given remote.
  * --from/--to can be used to control the remote repository that git-annex
    uses.
  * --quiet can be used to avoid verbose output
  * New plumbing-level dropkey and addkey subcommands.
  * Lots of bug fixes.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Wed, 27 Oct 2010 16:39:29 -0400
