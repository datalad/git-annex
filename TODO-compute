* need progress bars for computations and implement PROGRESS message

* get input files for a computation (so `git-annex get .` gets every file,
  even when input files in a directory are processed after computed files)

* autoinit security

* addcomputed should honor annex.addunlocked.

* Perhaps recompute should write a new version of a file as an unlocked
  file when the file is currently unlocked?

* compute on files in submodules

* recompute could ingest keys for other files than the one being
  recomputed, and remember them. Then recomputing those files could just
  use those keys, without re-running a computation. (Better than --others
  which got removed.)

* `git-annex recompute foo bar baz`, when foo depends on bar which depends
  on baz, and when baz has changed, will not recompute foo, because bar has
  not changed. It then recomputes bar. So running the command again is
  needed to recompute foo. 

  What it could do is, after it recomputes bar, notice that it already
  considered foo, and revisit foo, and recompute it then. It could either
  use a bloom filter to remember the files it considered but did not
  compute, or it could just notice that the command line includes foo
  (or includes a directory that contains foo), and then foo is not
  modified.

  Or it could build a DAG and traverse it, but building a DAG of a large
  directory tree has its own problems.

* Should addcomputed honor annex.smallfiles? That would seem to imply
  that recompute should also support recomputing non-annexed files.
  Otherwise, adding a file and then recomputing it would vary in
  what the content of the file is, depending on annex.smallfiles setting.
