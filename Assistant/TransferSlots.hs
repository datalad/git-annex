 -
 - Smilarly, for uploads, check if the remote is known to already have
 - the object.
 -
 - Also, uploads get queued to all remotes, in order of cost.
 - This may mean, for example, that an object is uploaded over the LAN
 - to a locally paired client, and once that upload is done, a more
 - expensive transfer remote no longer wants the object. (Since
 - all the clients have it already.) So do one last check if this is still
 - preferred content.
 -
 - We'll also do one last preferred content check for downloads. An
 - example of a case where this could be needed is if a download is queued
 - for a file that gets moved out of an archive directory -- but before
 - that download can happen, the file is put back in the archive.
