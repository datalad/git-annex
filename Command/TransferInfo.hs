{- Security:
 - 
 - The transfer info file contains the user-supplied key, but
 - the built-in guards prevent slashes in it from showing up in the filename.
 - It also contains the UUID of the remote. But slashes are also filtered
 - out of that when generating the filename.
 - 
 - Checks that the key being transferred is inAnnex, to prevent
 - malicious spamming of bogus keys. Does not check that a transfer
 - of the key is actually in progress, because this could be started
 - concurrently with sendkey, and win the race.
