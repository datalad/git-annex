{- After git repository repair, the .git/annex/index file could
 - still be broken, by pointing to bad objects, or might just be corrupt on
 - its own. Since this index file is not used to stage things
 - for long durations of time, it can safely be deleted if it is broken.
 -
 - Otherwise, if the git-annex branch was modified by the repair,
 - commit the index file to the git-annex branch.
 - This way, if the git-annex branch got rewound to an old version by
 - the repository repair, or was completely deleted, this will get it back
 - to a good state. Note that in the unlikely case where the git-annex
 - branch was rewound to a state that, had new changes from elsewhere not
 - yet reflected in the index, this does properly merge those into the
 - index before committing.
