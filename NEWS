git-annex (6.20170101.1) unstable; urgency=medium

  A security fix has changed git-annex to refuse to download content from
  some special remotes when the content cannot be verified with a hash check.
  In particular URL and WORM keys stored on such remotes won't be downloaded.
  See the documentation of the annex.security.allow-unverified-downloads
  configuration for how to deal with this if it affects your files.

  A security fix has changed git-annex to only support http, https, and ftp
  URL schemes by default. You can enable other URL schemes, at your own risk,
  using annex.security.allowed-url-schemes.

  A related security fix prevents git-annex from downloading content from
  the web. This can be overridden with the 
  annex.security.allowed-http-addresses setting.
  (The S3, glacier, and webdav special remotes are still allowed to
  download from the web.)

  The annex.web-download-command configuration has been removed,
  use annex.web-options instead.

git-annex (6.20170101) unstable; urgency=medium

  XMPP support has been removed from the assistant in this release.

  If your repositories used XMPP to keep in sync, that will no longer
  work, and you should enable some other remote to keep them in sync.
  A ssh server is one way, or use the new Tor pairing feature.

git-annex (4.20131002) unstable; urgency=low

   The layout of gcrypt repositories has changed, and
   if you created one you must manually upgrade it.
   See /usr/share/doc/git-annex/html/upgrades/gcrypt.html

git-annex (3.20120123) unstable; urgency=low

  There was a bug in the handling of directory special remotes that
  could cause partial file contents to be stored in them. If you use
  a directory special remote, you should fsck it, to avoid potential
  data loss.

  Example: git annex fsck --from mydirectory

git-annex (3.20110624) experimental; urgency=low

  There has been another change to the git-annex data store.
  Use `git annex upgrade` to migrate your repositories to the new
  layout. See <http://git-annex.branchable.com/upgrades/> or
  /usr/share/doc/git-annex/html/upgrades.html

  The significant change this time is that the .git-annex/ directory
  is gone; instead there is a git-annex branch that is automatically
  maintained by git-annex, and encapsulates all its state nicely out
  of your way.

  You should make sure you include the git-annex branch when
  git pushing and pulling.

git-annex (0.20110316) experimental; urgency=low

  This version reorganises the layout of git-annex's files in your repository.
  There is an upgrade process to convert a repository from the old git-annex
  to this version. See <http://git-annex.branchable.com/upgrades/> or
  /usr/share/doc/git-annex/html/upgrades.html
