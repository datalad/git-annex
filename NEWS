git-annex (6.20170228) unstable; urgency=medium

  This version of git-annex has mitigations for SHA1 hash collision
  problems.
  
  A new annex.securehashesonly configuration, when used in combination with
  signed git commits, avoids potential hash collision problems in git-annex
  repositories. For details, see this web page:

git-annex (6.20170101) unstable; urgency=medium

  XMPP support has been removed from the assistant in this release.

  If your repositories used XMPP to keep in sync, that will no longer
  work, and you should enable some other remote to keep them in sync.
  A ssh server is one way, or use the new Tor pairing feature.

   The layout of gcrypt repositories has changed, and
   if you created one you must manually upgrade it.
   See /usr/share/doc/git-annex/html/upgrades/gcrypt.html

git-annex (3.20120123) unstable; urgency=low

  There was a bug in the handling of directory special remotes that
  could cause partial file contents to be stored in them. If you use
  a directory special remote, you should fsck it, to avoid potential
  data loss.

  Example: git annex fsck --from mydirectory

git-annex (3.20110624) experimental; urgency=low

  There has been another change to the git-annex data store.
  Use `git annex upgrade` to migrate your repositories to the new
  layout. See <http://git-annex.branchable.com/upgrades/> or
  /usr/share/doc/git-annex/html/upgrades.html

  The significant change this time is that the .git-annex/ directory
  is gone; instead there is a git-annex branch that is automatically
  maintained by git-annex, and encapsulates all its state nicely out
  of your way.

  You should make sure you include the git-annex branch when
  git pushing and pulling.

git-annex (0.20110316) experimental; urgency=low

  This version reorganises the layout of git-annex's files in your repository.
  There is an upgrade process to convert a repository from the old git-annex
  to this version. See <http://git-annex.branchable.com/upgrades/> or
  /usr/share/doc/git-annex/html/upgrades.html
