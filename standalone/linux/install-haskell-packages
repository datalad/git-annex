# Bootstraps from an empty cabal (plus apt-get build-dep git-annex)
# to all the necessary haskell packages being installed, with the
# necessary patches to work on architectures that lack template haskell.
#
# Note that the newest version of packages is installed. 
# It attempts to reuse patches for older versions, but 
# new versions of packages often break cross-compilation by adding TH, 
# etc
#
# Future work: Convert to using the method used here:
