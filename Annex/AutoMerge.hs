{- Resolves a conflicted merge. It's important that any conflicts be
 - resolved in a way that itself avoids later merge conflicts, since
 - multiple repositories may be doing this concurrently.
 -
 - Only merge conflicts where at least one side is an annexed file
 - is resolved.
 -
 - This uses the Keys pointed to by the files to construct new
 - filenames. So when both sides modified annexed file foo, 
 - it will be deleted, and replaced with files foo.variant-A and
 - foo.variant-B.
 -
 - On the other hand, when one side deleted foo, and the other modified it,
 - it will be deleted, and the modified version stored as file
 - foo.variant-A (or B).
 -
 - It's also possible that one side has foo as an annexed file, and
 - the other as a directory or non-annexed file. The annexed file
 - is renamed to resolve the merge, and the other object is preserved as-is.
 -
 - In indirect mode, the merge is resolved in the work tree and files
 - staged, to clean up from a conflicted merge that was run in the work
 - tree. 
 -
 - In direct mode, the work tree is not touched here; files are staged to
 - the index, and written to the gitAnnexMergeDir, for later handling by
 - the direct mode merge code.
 - 
 - This is complicated by needing to support merges run in an overlay
 - work tree, in which case the CWD won't be within the work tree.
 - In this mode, there is no need to update the work tree at all,
 - as the overlay work tree will get deleted.
 -
 - Unlocked files remain unlocked after merging, and locked files
 - remain locked. When the merge conflict is between a locked and unlocked
 - file, that otherwise point to the same content, the unlocked mode wins.
 - This is done because only unlocked files work in filesystems that don't
 - support symlinks.
 -
 - Returns false when there are no merge conflicts to resolve.
 - A git merge can fail for other reasons, and this allows detecting
 - such failures.
