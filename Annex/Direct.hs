{- In direct mode, git merge would usually refuse to do anything, since it
 - sees present direct mode files as type changed files.
 -
 - So, to handle a merge, it's run with the work tree set to a temp
 - directory, and the merge is staged into a copy of the index.
 - Then the work tree is updated to reflect the merge, and
 - finally, the merge is committed and the real index updated.
 -
 - A lock file is used to avoid races with any other caller of mergeDirect.
 - 
 - To avoid other git processes from making changes to the index while our
 - merge is in progress, the index lock file is used as the temp index
 - file. This is the same as what git does when updating the index
 - normally.
