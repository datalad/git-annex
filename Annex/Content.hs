{- Moves a key's content into .git/annex/objects/
 -
 - When a key has associated pointer files, the object is hard
 - linked (or copied) to the files, and the object file is left thawed.
 
 - In direct mode, moves the object file to the associated file, or files.
 -
 - What if the key there already has content? This could happen for
 - various reasons; perhaps the same content is being annexed again.
 - Perhaps there has been a hash collision generating the keys.
 -
 - The current strategy is to assume that in this case it's safe to delete
 - one of the two copies of the content; and the one already in the annex
 - is left there, assuming it's the original, canonical copy.
 -
 - I considered being more paranoid, and checking that both files had
 - the same content. Decided against it because A) users explicitly choose
 - a backend based on its hashing properties and so if they're dealing
 - with colliding files it's their own fault and B) adding such a check
 - would not catch all cases of colliding keys. For example, perhaps 
 - a remote has a key; if it's then added again with different content then
 - the overall system now has two different peices of content for that
 - key, and one of them will probably get deleted later. So, adding the
 - check here would only raise expectations that git-annex cannot truely
 - meet.
 -
 - May return false, when a particular variety of key is not being
 - accepted into the repository. Will display a warning message in this
 - case. May also throw exceptions in some cases.
