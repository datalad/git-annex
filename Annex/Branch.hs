{- Runs an action on the content of selected files from the branch.

 -
 - The action is passed a callback that it can repeatedly call to read
 - the next file and its contents. When there are no more files, the
 - callback will return Nothing.
 -
 - In some cases the callback may return the same file more than once,
 - with different content. This happens rarely, only when the journal
 - contains additional information, and the last version of the
 - file it returns is the most current one.
