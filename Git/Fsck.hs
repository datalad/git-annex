{- Runs fsck to find some of the broken objects in the repository.
 - May not find all broken objects, if fsck fails on bad data in some of
 - the broken objects it does find.
 -
 - Strategy: Rather than parsing fsck's current specific output,
 - look for anything in its output (both stdout and stderr) that appears
 - to be a git sha. Not all such shas are of broken objects, so ask git
 - to try to cat the object, and see if it fails.
 -
 - Note that there is a possible false positive: When changes are being
 - made to the repo while this is running, fsck might complain about a
 - missing object that has not made it to disk yet. Catting the object
 - then succeeds, so it's not included in the FsckResults. But, fsck then
 - exits nonzero, and so FsckFailed is returned. Set ignorenonzeroexit
 - to avoid this false positive, at the risk of perhaps missing a problem
 - so bad that fsck crashes without outputting any missing shas.
