  * annex.version increased to 6, but version 5 is also still supported.
  * The upgrade to version 6 is not done fully automatically, because
    upgrading a direct mode repository to version 6 will prevent old
    versions of git-annex from working in other clones of that repository.
  * smudge: New command, used for git smudge filter. 
    This will replace direct mode.
  * init: Configure .git/info/attributes to use git-annex as a smudge
    filter. Note that this changes the default behavior of git add in a
    newly initialized repository; it will add files to the annex.

  * Build with -j1 again to get reproducible build.
  * Display progress meter in -J mode when copying from a local git repo,
    to a local git repo, and from a remote git repo.
  * Display progress meter in -J mode when downloading from the web.
  * map: Improve display of git remotes with non-ssh urls, including http
    and gcrypt. 
  * When core.sharedRepository is set, annex object files are not made mode
    444, since that prevents a user other than the file owner from locking
    them. Instead, a mode such as 664 is used in this case.
  * tahoe: Include tahoe capabilities in whereis display.
  * import: Changed to honor annex.largefiles settings.
  * addurl, importfeed: Changed to honor annex.largefiles settings,
    when the content of the url is downloaded. (Not when using --fast or
    --relaxed.)
  * webapp: Fix bugs that could result in a relative path such as "."
    being written to ~/.config/git-annex/autostart, and ignore any such 
    relative paths in the file.
    This was a reversion caused by the relative path changes in 5.20150113.
  * dropunused: Make more robust when trying to drop an object that has
    already been dropped.
  * Fix reversion in handling of long filenames, particularly when using
    addurl/importfeed, which was introduced in the previous release.

git-annex (5.20151116) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Use concurrent-output library when configured with -fConcurrentOutput.
    This allows nicely displayed messages when using the -J flag.
  * Additional commands now support the -J flag: 
    fsck, drop, add, addurl, import
  * import: Avoid very ugly error messages when the directory files
    are imported to is not a directort, but perhaps an annexed file.
  * Concurrent progress bars are now displayed when using -J with a command
    that moves file contents around.
  * Fix race that could result in an annexed file's symlink not being
    created, when eg, running concurrent git-annex adds.
  * add: Fix error recovery rollback to not move the injested file content
    out of the annex back to the file, because other files may point to
    that same content. Instead, copy the injected file content out to
    recover.
  * quvi may output utf-8 encoded data when the conifigured locale doesn't
    support that; avoid crashing on such invalid encoding.
  * runshell: Avoid failing when $HOME/.ssh does not exist and cannot be
    created.
  * Make the git-annex-standalone.deb prevent runshell from installing
    wrappers into $HOME/.ssh
  * Make git-annex-standalone.deb include the git-annex html documentation,
    desktop file, and base completion file, same as the regular git-annex.deb.
  * fsck: When fscking a dead repo, avoid incorrect "fixing location log"
    message, and display a warning about it being dead, since it's unusual
    to have access to a dead repo.
  * assistant: Pass ssh-options through 3 more git pull/push calls
    that were missed before.
  * Added annex.pidlock and annex.pidlocktimeout configuration to support
    filesystems where POSIX fcntl locks cannot be used.
  * init: Automatically enable annex.pidlock when necessary.

  * Use statvfs on OSX.
  * Symlink timestamp preservation code uses functions
    from unix-2.7.0 when available, which should be more portable.
  * enableremote: List uuids and descriptions of remotes that can be
    enabled, and accept either the uuid or the description in leu if the
    name.
  * Catch up with current git behavior when both repo and repo.git exist;
    it seems it now prefers repo in this case, although historically it may
    have preferred repo.git.
  * Fix failure to build with aws-0.13.0.

git-annex (5.20151019) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Fix a longstanding, but unlikely to occur bug, where dropping
    a file from a remote could race with other drops of the same file,
    and result in all copies of its content being lost.
  * git-annex-shell: Added lockcontent command, to prevent dropping of
    a key's content. This is necessary due to the above bugfix.
  * In some cases, the above bugfix changes what git-annex allows you to
    drop:
    - When a file is present in several special remotes,
      but not in any accessible git repositories, dropping it from one of
      the special remotes will now fail. Instead, the file has to be
      moved from one of the special remotes to the git repository, and can
      then safely be dropped from the git repository.
    - If a git remote has too old a version of git-annex-shell installed,
      git-annex won't trust it to hold onto a copy of a file when dropping
      that file from the local git repository.
  * Changed drop ordering when using git annex sync --content or the
    assistant, to drop from remotes first and from the local repo last.
    This works better with the behavior changes to drop in many cases.
  * Do verification of checksums of annex objects downloaded from remotes.
  * When annex objects are received into git repositories from other git
    repos, their checksums are verified then too.
  * To get the old, faster, behavior of not verifying checksums, set
    annex.verify=false, or remote.<name>.annex-verify=false.
  * setkey, rekey: These commands also now verify that the provided file
    matches the expected checksum of the key, unless annex.verify=false.
  * reinject: Already verified content; this can now be disabled by
    setting annex.verify=false.
  * sync, merge, assistant: When git merge failed for a reason other
    than a conflicted merge, such as a crippled filesystem not allowing
    particular characters in filenames, git-annex would make a merge commit
    that could omit such files or otherwise be bad. Fixed by aborting the
    whole merge process when git merge fails for any reason other than a
    merge conflict.
  * Allow building with S3 disabled again.
  * Ported disk free space checking code to work on Solaris.
  * Windows webapp: Fix support for entering password when setting
    up a ssh remote.
  * copy --auto was checking the wrong repo's preferred content.
    (--from was checking what --to should, and vice-versa.)
    Fixed this bug, which was introduced in version 5.20150727.
  * Avoid unncessary write to the location log when a file is unlocked
    and then added back with unchanged content.
  * S3: Fix support for using https.
  * Avoid displaying network transport warning when a ssh remote
    does not yet have an annex.uuid set.
  * Debian: Add torrent library to build-depends as it's packaged now,
    and stop recommending bittornado | bittorrent.
  * Debian: Remove build dependency on transformers library, as it is now
    included in ghc.
  * Debian: Remove menu file, since a desktop file is provided and
    lintian says there can be only one.

git-annex (5.20150930) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Added new linux standalone "ancient" build to support kernels
    like 2.6.32.
  * info: Don't allow use in a non-git-annex repository, since it
    uses the git-annex branch and would create it if it were missing.
  * assistant: When updating ~/.ssh/config, preserve any symlinks.
  * webapp: Remove the "disable remote" feature from the UI.
  * S3: When built with aws-0.13.0, supports using more storage classes.
    In particular, storageclass=STANDARD_IA to use Amazon's
    new Infrequently Accessed storage, and storageclass=NEARLINE
    to use Google's NearLine storage.
  * Improve ~/.ssh/config modification code to not add trailing spaces
    to lines it cannot parse.
  * Fix a crash at direct mode merge time when .git/index doesn't exist
    yet. Triggered by eg, git-annex sync --no-commit in a fresh clone of
    a repository.
  * status: Show added but not yet committed files.
  * Added stack.yaml to support easy builds from source with stack.

git-annex (5.20150916) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Fix Windows build to work with ghc 7.10.
  * init: Fix reversion in detection of repo made with git clone --shared
  * info: Support querying info of individual files in direct mode.
  * unused: Fix reversion in 5.20150727 that broke parsing of the
    --unused-refspec option. Thanks, Øyvind A. Holm.
  * Make full option parsing be done when not in a git repo, so --help
    can be displayed for commands that require a git repo, etc.
  * fsck: Work around bug in persistent that broke display of
    problematically encoded filenames on stderr when using --incremental.
  * When gpg.program is configured, it's used to get the command to run
    for gpg. Useful on systems that have only a gpg2 command or want to
    use it instead of the gpg command.
  * Windows: Switched to using git for Windows, rather than msysgit.
    Using msysgit with git-annex is no longer supported.
  * Windows: Even when the user neglects to tell the git installer to
    add git to PATH, git-annex will still work from within the git bash
    shell, and the webapp can be used too.
  * sync: Add --no-commit, --no-pull, --no-push options to turn off parts of
    the sync process, as well as supporting --commit, --pull, --push, and
    --no-content options to specify the (current) default behavior.
  * annex.hardlink extended to also try to use hard links when copying from
    the repository to a remote.
  * Improve bash completion, so it completes names of remotes and backends
    in appropriate places.
  * Special remotes configured with autoenable=true will be automatically
    enabled when git-annex init is run.
  * Fix bug in combination of preferred and required content settings.
    When one was set to the empty string and the other set to some expression,
    this bug caused all files to be wanted, instead of only files matching
    the expression.

    non-data-transfer overhead 6x.
  * sync: Support --jobs
  * sync --content: Avoid unnecessary second pull from remotes when 
    no file transfers are made.
  * External special remotes can now be built that can be used in readonly
    mode, where git-annex downloads content from the remote using regular
    http.
  * Added WHEREIS to external special remote protocol.
  * importfeed --relaxed: Avoid hitting the urls of items in the feed.
  * Fix reversion in init when ran as root, introduced in version 5.20150731.
  * Reorder declaration to fix build with yesod-core > 1.4.13.
    Thanks, Michael Alan Dorman.
  * Fix building without quvi and without database.
    Thanks, Ben Boeckel.
  * Avoid building the assistant on the hurd, since an inotify equivalent
    is not yet implemented in git-annex for the hurd.
  * --debug log messages are now timestamped with fractional seconds.
  * --debug is passed along to git-annex-shell when git-annex is in debug mode.
  * Makefile: Pass LDFLAGS, CFLAGS, and CPPFLAGS through ghc and on to
    ld, cc, and cpp.
  * As a result of the Makefile changes, the Debian package is built
    with various hardening options. Although their benefit to a largely
    haskell program is unknown.

git-annex (5.20150812) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Added support for SHA3 hashed keys (in 8 varieties), when git-annex is
    built using the cryptonite library.
  * metadata: Fix reversion introduced in 5.20150727 that caused recursive
    display of metadata to not work.
  * Windows: Fix bug that caused git-annex sync to fail due to missing
    environment variable.
  * Fix setting/setting/viewing metadata that contains unicode or other
    special characters, when in a non-unicode locale.
  * Simplify setup process for a ssh remote. Now it suffices to run git
    remote add, followed by git-annex sync. Now the remote is automatically
    initialized for use by git-annex, where before the git-annex branch had
    to manually be pushed before using git-annex sync. Note that this
    involved changes to git-annex-shell, so if the remote is using an old
    version, the manual push is still needed.
  * git-annex-shell: Don't let configlist auto-init repository when in
    readonly mode.
  * Perform a clean shutdown when --time-limit is reached.
    This includes running queued git commands, and cleanup actions normally
    run when a command is finished.
  * fsck: Commit incremental fsck database when --time-limit is reached.
    Previously, some of the last files fscked did not make it into the
    database when using --time-limit.
  * fsck: Commit incremental fsck database after every 1000 files
    fscked, or every 5 minutes, whichever comes first. Previously,
    commits were made every 1000 files fscked.
  * Linux standalone: Work around problem that prevented it from working
    properly if unpacked into a directory that contains ":" or ";" in its
    name.
  * proxy: Fix proxy git commit of non-annexed files in direct mode. 
  * proxy: If a non-proxied git command, such as git revert
    would normally fail because of unstaged files in the work tree,
    make the proxied command fail the same way.
  * proxy: Fix removal of files deleted by the proxied command.
  * proxy: Fix behavior when run in subdirectory of git repo.
  * Improve Setup.hs file so that cabal copy --destdir works.
    Thanks, Magnus Therning.
  * Tighten dependency on optparse-applicative to 0.11.0.
  * Added back debian/cabal-wrapper, since it still seems needed after all.

    back.
  * init: Detect when the filesystem is crippled such that it ignores

git-annex (5.20150727) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Fix bug that prevented uploads to remotes using new-style chunking
    from resuming after the last successfully uploaded chunk.
  * Switched option parsing to use optparse-applicative. This was a very large
    and invasive change, and may have caused some minor behavior changes to
    edge cases of option parsing. (For example, the metadata command no
    longer accepts the combination of --get and --set, which never actually
    worked.)
  * Bash completion file is now included in the git-annex source tree, 
    and installed into Debian package (and any other packages built using make
    install). This bash completion is generated by the option parser, so it
    covers all commands, all options, and will never go out of date!
  * As well as tab completing "git-annex" commands, "git annex" will also tab
    complete. However, git's bash completion script needs a patch,
    which I've submitted, for this to work prefectly.
  * version --raw now works when run outside a git repository.
  * assistant --startdelay now works when run outside a git repository.
  * dead now accepts multiple --key options.
  * addurl now accepts --prefix and --suffix options to adjust the
    filenames used.
  * sync --content: Fix bug that caused files to be uploaded to eg,
    more archive remotes than wanted copies, only to later be dropped
    to satisfy the preferred content settings.
  * importfeed: Improve detection of known items whose url has changed,
    and avoid adding redundant files. Where before this only looked at
    permalinks in rss feeds, it now also looks at guids.
  * importfeed: Look at not only permalinks, but now also guids
    to identify previously downloaded files.
  * Webapp: Now features easy setup of git-annex repositories on gitlab.com.
  * Adjust debian build deps: The webapp can now build on arm64, s390x
    and hurd-i386. WebDAV support is also available on those architectures.
  * Debian package now maintained by Richard Hartmann.
  * Support building without persistent database on for systems that
    lack TH. This removes support for incremental fsck.

git-annex (5.20150710) unstable; urgency=medium

  * add: Stage symlinks the same as git add would, even if they are not a
    link to annexed content.
  * sync: When annex.autocommit=false, avoid making any commit of local
    changes, while still merging with remote to the extent possible.
  * unused: --used-refspec can now be configured to look at refs in the
    reflog. This provides a way to not consider old versions of files to be
    unused after they have reached a specified age, when the old refs in
    the reflog expire.
  * log: Fix reversion introduced in version 5.20150528 that broke this command.
  * assistant --autostart: First stop any daemons that are already running,
    which might be left over from a previous login session and so unable to
    use the ssh agent of a new login session.
  * assistant: Fix local pairing to not include newline in ssh pubkey,
    which is rejected on the other end for security reasons.
  * assistant: Fix ANNEX_SHELL_DIR written to ~/.ssh/authorized_keys 
    in local pairing to be the absolute path to the repository, not "."
    This was a reversion caused by the relative path changes in 5.20150113.
  * Brought back the setkey plumbing command that was removed in 2011, since
    we found a use case for it. Note that the command's syntax was changed
    for consistency.
  * bugfix: Pass --full-tree when using git ls-files to get a list of files
    on the git-annex branch, so it works when run in a subdirectory.
    This bug affected git-annex unused, and potentially also transitions
    running code and other things.
  * Support git's undocumented core.sharedRepository=2 value, which
    is equivalent to "world", and is set when a repo was created using
    git init --shared=world.
  * When building on linux, pass --as-needed to linker to avoid linking
    with unused shared libraries including libyaml.
  * import: Fix failure of cross-device import on Windows.
  * merge: Avoid creating the synced/master branch.
  * Removed support for optparse-applicative versions older than 0.10.

  * Now supports git annex sync --all --content to sync all versions of all
    files with all repos that want them.
  * Added new "anything" preferred content expression, which matches all
    versions of all files.
  * Standard preferred content for client, backup, incremental backup,
    and unwanted groups have been adjusted to work better when used
    with git annex sync --all --content.
  * fromkey, registerurl: Improve handling of urls that happen to also
    be parsable as strange keys.
  * sync, remotedaemon: Pass configured ssh-options even when
    annex.sshcaching is disabled.
  * assistant: Consume systemd-networkd dbus events to learn about
    changes to network connections, as was already done with
    network-manager and wicd.
    Thanks to Sebastian Reuße for the patches.
  * get --incomplete: New option to resume any interrupted downloads.
  * dead --key: Can be used to mark a key as dead.
  * fsck: Ignore keys that are known to be dead when running in
    --all/--unused/--key mode or a in a bare repo. Closes: #753888
    Otherwise, still reports files with lost contents, even if the content
    is dead.
  * S3: Special remotes can be configured with public=yes to allow
    the public to access the bucket's content.
  * S3: Publically accessible buckets can be used without creds.
  * import --clean-duplicates: Fix bug that didn't count local or trusted
    repo's copy of a file as one of the necessary copies to allow removing
    it from the import location.
  * tahoe: Use ~/.tahoe-git-annex/ rather than ~/.tahoe/git-annex/
    when setting up a tahoe special remote to avoid old versions of
    tahoe create-client choking.
  * Fix bug that prevented enumerating locally present objects in repos
    tuned with annex.tune.objecthash1=true.
    Fixes: unused, object count in info, unannex.
  * Improve url parsing to handle some urls containing illegal []
    characters in their paths.
  * info: Added json output for "backend usage", "numcopies stats",
    "repositories containing these files", and "transfers in progress".
  * Fix incremental backup standard preferred content expression to match
    its documentation, which says it does not want files that have reached
    a backup repository.
  * Increased the default annex.bloomaccuracy from 1000 to 10000000.
    This makes git annex unused use up to 16 mb more memory than it did
    before, but the massive increase in accuracy makes this worthwhile
    for all but the smallest systems.
  * Build documentation with deterministic=1 for reproducible builds.
    (A new ikiwiki feature.) Closes: #785736
  * Re-remove dependency on obsolete hamlet package. Closes: #786659
  * debian/cabal-wrapper: Removed this hack which should not be needed anymore.

    path with spaces in its name.
  * Revert removal dependency on obsolete hamlet package, since the

    For example: git-annex get -J10
    However, progress bars are not yet displayed for concurrent transfers,
    pending an updated version of the ascii-progress library.
  * --quiet now makes progress output by rsync, wget, etc be quiet too.
  * Take space that will be used by other running downloads into account when

  * Fix an unlikely race that could result in two transfers of the same key
    running at once.
  * Stale transfer lock and info files will be cleaned up automatically
    when get/unused/info commands are run.
  * unused: Add --used-refspec option and annex.used-refspec, which can
    specify a set of refs to consider used, rather than the default of
    considering all refs used.
  * webapp: Fix zombie xdg-open process left when opening file browser.
    Closes: #785498
  * Safer posix fctnl locking implementation, using lock pools and STM.
  * Build documentation with TZ=UTC for reproducible builds. See #785736.
  * OSX: Corrected the location of trustedkeys.gpg, so the built-in
    upgrade code will find it. Fixes OSX upgrade going forward, but
    older versions won't upgrade themselves due to this problem.

    cannot handle upper-case bucket names. git-annex now converts them to
    lower case automatically.
  * import: Check for gitignored files before moving them into the tree.
    (Needs git 1.8.4 or newer.)
  * import: Don't stop entire import when one file fails due to being
    gitignored or conflicting with something in the work tree.
  * import: Before removing a duplicate file in --deduplicate or
    --clean-duplicates mode, verify that enough copies of its content still
    exist.
  * Improve integration with KDE's file manager to work with dolphin
    version 14.12.3 while still being compatable with 4.14.2.
    Thanks, silvio.
  * assistant: Added --autostop to complement --autostart.
  * Work around wget bug #784348 which could cause it to clobber git-annex
    symlinks when downloading from ftp.
  * Support checking ftp urls for file presence.
  * Fix bogus failure of fsck --fast.
  * fsck: Ignore error recording the fsck in the activity log,
    which can happen when running fsck in a read-only repository.
    Closes: #698559
    (fsck can still need to write to the repository if it find problems,
    but a successful fsck can be done read-only)
  * Improve quvi 0.4 output parsing to handle cases wher there is no known
    filename extension. This is currently the case when using quvi with
    youtube. In this case, the extension ".m" will be used.
  * Dropped support for older versions of yesod, warp, and dbus than the ones
    in Debian Jessie.
  * Switch from the obsolete dataenc library for base64 encoding to sandi.
    (Thanks, Magnus Therning)
  * Debian's ghc now supports TH on arm! Adjust build dependencies
    to build the webapp on arm, and enable DAV support on arm. \o/
  * Adjust some other arch specific build dependencies that are now
    available on more architectures in Devian unstable.
  * Windows: Remove cygwin ssh, the newer version of which has stopped
    honoring the setting of HOME. Instead, copy msysgit's ssh into PATH.
    Note that setting up a remote ssh server using password authentication
    is known to be broken in this release on Windows.
  * Windows: Roll back to an older version of rsync from cygwin.
    The newer version has some dependency on a newer ssh from cygwin.

git-annex (5.20150420) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Fix activity log parsing, which caused the log to not retain
    activity from other uuids.
  * Union merge could fall over if there was a file in the repository
    with the same name as a git ref. Now fixed.
  * info dir: Added information about repositories that
    contain files in the specified directory.
  * info: Added --bytes option.
  * bittorrent: Fix handling of magnet links.
  * When a key's size is unknown, still check the annex.diskreserve,
    and avoid getting content if the disk is too full.
  * Fix fsck --from a git remote in a local directory, and from
    a directory special remote.
    This was a reversion caused by the relative path changes in 5.20150113.
  * fsck --from remote: When bad content is found in the remote,
    and the local repo does not have a copy of the content, preserve
    the bad content in .git/annex/bad/ to avoid further data loss.
  * fsck --from remote: Avoid downloading a key if it would go over
    the annex.diskreserve limit.
  * required: New command, like wanted, but for required content.
  * Removed dependency on haskell SHA library,
    instead using cryptohash >= 0.11.0.
  * Make repo init more robust.
  * New debian/rules build-standalone target, which generates a
    git-annex-standalone.deb that should work on many old Debian etc
    systems. Thanks, Yaroslav Halchenko.
  * Windows: Renamed start menu file to avoid loop in some versions
    of Windows where the menu file is treated as a git-annex program.
  * Windows: Fixed support of remotes on other drives.
    (A reversion introduced in version 5.20150113.)
  * Windows: Bundled versions of rsync, wget, ssh, and gpg from
    cygwin all updated. Thanks, Yury V. Zaytsev.

    changes in version 5.20150406.
  * --quiet now suppresses progress displays from eg, rsync.
    (Second time's the charm..)
  * fromkey, registerurl: When reading from stdin, allow the
    filename and url, respectively, to contain whitespace.
  * add: If annex.largefiles is set and does not match a file that's being
    added, the file will be checked into git rather than being added to the
    annex. Previously, git annex add skipped over such files; this new
    behavior is more useful in direct mode.
  * proxy: Made it work when run in a new repository before initial
    commit.
  * info: Display repository mode: bare when in a bare (non-direct mode)
    repo.
  * importfeed: Fix feed download when curl is used.
  * importfeed: Error out when passed a non-url.
  * webapp: When adding another local repository, and combining it
    with the current repository, the new repository's remote path
    was set to "." rather than the path to the current repository.
    This was a reversion caused by the relative path changes in 5.20150113.
  * contentlocationn: New plumbing command.

  * Prevent git-ls-files from double-expanding wildcards when an
    unexpanded wildcard is passed to a git-annex command like add or find.
  * Fix make build target. Thanks, Justin Geibel.
  * Fix GETURLS in external special remote protocol to strip
    downloader prefix from logged url info before checking for the
    specified prefix.
  * importfeed: Avoid downloading a redundant item from a feed whose
    permalink has been seen before, even when the url has changed.
  * importfeed: Always store itemid in metadata; before this was only
    done when annex.genmetadata was set.
  * Relax debian package dependencies to git >= 1:1.8.1 rather
    than needing >= 1:2.0.
  * test: Fix --list-tests
  * addurl --file: When used with a special remote that claims
    urls and checks their contents, don't override the user's provided
    filename with filenames that the special remote suggests. Also,
    don't allow adding the url if the special remote says it contains
    multiple files.
  * import: --deduplicate and --cleanduplicates now output the keys
    corresponding to duplicated files they process.
  * expire: New command, for expiring inactive repositories.
  * fsck: Record fsck activity for use by expire command.
  * Fix truncation of parameters that could occur when using xargs git-annex.
  * Significantly sped up processing of large numbers of directories
    passed to a single git-annex command.
  * version: Add --raw
  * init: Improve fifo test to detect NFS systems that support fifos
    but not well enough for sshcaching.
  * --quiet now suppresses progress displays from eg, rsync.
    (The option already suppressed git-annex's own built-in progress
    displays.)

git-annex (5.20150327) unstable; urgency=medium

  * readpresentkey: New plumbing command for checking location log.
  * checkpresentkey: New plumbing command to check if a key can be verified
    to be present on a remote.
  * Added a post-update-annex hook, which is run after the git-annex branch
    is updated. Needed for git update-server-info.
  * migrate: --force will force migration of keys already using the
    destination backend. Useful in rare cases.
  * Man pages for individual commands now available, and can be
    opened using "git annex help <command>"
  * --auto is no longer a global option; only get, drop, and copy
    accept it. (Not a behavior change unless you were passing it to a
    command that ignored it.)
  * Improve error message when --in @date is used and there is no
    reflog for the git-annex branch.
  * assistant: Committing a whole lot of files at once could overflow
    command-line length limits and cause the commit to fail. This
    only happened when using the assistant in an indirect mode repository.
  * Work around curl bug when asked to download an empty url to a file.
  * Fix bug introduced in the last release that broke git-annex sync
    when git-annex was installed from the standalone tarball.

git-annex (5.20150317) unstable; urgency=medium

  * fsck: Incremental fsck uses sqlite to store its records, instead
    of abusing the sticky bit. Existing sticky bits are ignored;
    incremental fscks started by old versions won't be resumed by
    this version.
  * fsck: Multiple incremental fscks of different repos (including remotes)
    can now be running at the same time in the same repo without it
    getting confused about which files have been checked for which remotes.
  * unannex: Refuse to unannex when repo is too new to have a HEAD,
    since in this case there must be staged changes in the index
    (if there is anything to unannex), and the unannex code path
    needs to run with a clean index.
  * Linux standalone: Set LOCPATH=/dev/null to work around
    https://ghc.haskell.org/trac/ghc/ticket/7695
    This prevents localization from working, but git-annex
    is not localized anyway.
  * sync: As well as the synced/git-annex push, attempt a
    git-annex:git-annex push, as long as the remote branch
    is an ancestor of the local branch, to better support bare git repos.
    (This used to be done, but it forgot to do it since version 4.20130909.)
  * When re-execing git-annex, use current program location, rather than
    ~/.config/git-annex/program, when possible.
  * Submodules are now supported by git-annex!
  * metadata: Fix encoding problem that led to mojibake when storing
    metadata strings that contained both unicode characters and a space
    (or '!') character.
  * Also potentially fixes encoding problem when embedding credentials
    that contain unicode characters.
  * sync: Fix committing when in a direct mode repo that has no HEAD ref.
    (For example, a newly checked out git submodule.)
  * Added SETURIPRESENT and SETURIMISSING to external special remote protocol,
    useful for things like ipfs that don't use regular urls.
  * addurl: Added --raw option, which bypasses special handling of quvi,
    bittorrent etc urls.
  * git-annex-shell: Improve error message when the specified repository
    doesn't exist or git config fails for some reason.
  * fromkey --force: Skip test that the key has its content in the annex.
  * fromkey: Add stdin mode.
  * registerurl: New plumbing command for mass-adding urls to keys.
  * remotedaemon: Fixed support for notifications of changes to gcrypt
    remotes, which was never tested and didn't quite work before.

  * glacier: Detect when the glacier command in PATH is the wrong one,
    from boto, rather than from glacier-cli, and refuse to use it,
    since the boto program fails to fail when passed
    parameters it does not understand.
  * groupwanted: New command to set the groupwanted preferred content
    expression.
  * import: Support file matching options such as --exclude, --include, 
    --smallerthan, --largerthan
  * The file matching options are now only accepted by commands that
    can actually use them, instead of by all commands.
  * import: Avoid checksumming file twice when run in the default
    or --duplicate mode.
  * Windows: Fix bug in dropping an annexed file, which
    caused a symlink to be staged that contained backslashes.
  * webapp: Fix reversion in opening webapp when starting it manually
    inside a repository.
  * assistant: Improve sanity check for control characters when pairing.
  * Improve race recovery code when committing to git-annex branch.
  * addurl: Avoid crash if quvi is not installed, when git-annex was
    built with process-1.2
  * bittorrent: Fix mojibake introduced in parsing arai2c progress output.
  * fsck --from: If a download from a remote fails, propagate the failure.
  * metadata: When setting metadata, do not recurse into directories by
    default, since that can be surprising behavior and difficult to recover
    from. The old behavior is available by using --force.
  * sync, assistant: Include repository name in head branch commit message.
  * The ssh-options git config is now used by gcrypt, rsync, and ddar
    special remotes that use ssh as a transport.
  * sync, assistant: Use the ssh-options git config when doing git pull
    and push.
  * remotedaemon: Use the ssh-options git config.
  * Linux standalone: Improved process names of linker shimmed programs.

git-annex (5.20150205) unstable; urgency=medium

  * info: Can now display info about a given uuid.
  * Added to remote/uuid info: Count of the number of keys present
    on the remote, and their size. This is rather expensive to calculate,
    so comes last and --fast will disable it.
  * info remote: Include the date of the last sync with the remote.
  * sync: Added --message/-m option like git commit.
  * remotedaemon: Fix problem that could prevent ssh connections being
    made after two LOSTNET messages were received in a row (perhaps due to
    two different network interfaces being brought down).
  * Fix build failure when wget is not installed.
  * Fix wording of message displayed when unable to get a file that
    is available in untrusted repositories.
  * addurl: When a Content-Disposition header suggests a filename to use,
    addurl will consider using it, if it's reasonable and doesn't conflict
    with an existing file. (--file overrides this)
  * Fix default repository description created by git annex init,
    which got broken by the relative path changes in the last release.
  * init: Repository tuning parameters can now be passed when initializing a
    repository for the first time. For details, see
    http://git-annex.branchable.com/tuning/
  * merge: Refuse to merge changes from a git-annex branch of a repo
    that has been tuned in incompatible ways.
  * Support annex.tune.objecthash1, annex.tune.objecthashlower, and
    annex.tune.branchhash1.
  * Remove support for building without cryptohash.
  * Added MD5 and MD5E backends.
  * assistant: Fix local pairing when ssh pubkey comment contains spaces.
  * Avoid using fileSize which maxes out at just 2 gb on Windows.
    Instead, use hFileSize, which doesn't have a bounded size.
    Fixes support for files > 2 gb on Windows.
  * Windows: Fix running of the pre-commit-annex hook.

  * unlock: Don't allow unlocking files that have never been committed to git

    hook from telling if such a file is intended to be an annexed file or not.
  * Avoid re-checksumming when migrating from hash to hashE backend.
    Closes: #774494
  * Fix build with process 1.2.1.0.
  * Android: Provide a version built with -fPIE -pie to support Android 5.0.
  * sync: Fix an edge case where syncing in a bare repository would try to
    merge and so fail.
  * Check git version at runtime, rather than assuming it will be the same
    as the git version used at build time when running git-checkattr and
    git-branch remove.
  * Switch to using relative paths to the git repository.
    - This allows the git repository to be moved while git-annex is running in
      it, with fewer problems.
    - On Windows, this avoids some of the problems with the absurdly small
      MAX_PATH of 260 bytes. In particular, git-annex repositories should
      work in deeper/longer directory structures than before.
  * Generate shorter keys for WORM and URL, avoiding keys that are longer
    than used for SHA256, so as to not break on systems like Windows that
    have very small maximum path length limits.
  * Bugfix: A file named HEAD in the work tree could confuse some git commands
    run by git-annex.

    added files even if adding one of the urls fails.
  * bittorrent: Fix locking problem when using addurl file://

  * Urls can now be claimed by remotes. This will allow creating,

    *.torrent urls.
  * Use wget -q --show-progress for less verbose wget output,
    when built with wget 1.16.
  * Added bittorrent special remote.
  * addurl behavior change: When downloading an url ending in .torrent,
    it will download files from bittorrent, instead of the old behavior
    of adding the torrent file to the repository.
  * Added Recommends on aria2.
  * When possible, build with the haskell torrent library for parsing
    torrent files. As a fallback, can instead use btshowmetainfo from
    bittornado | bittorrent.

  * Add undo action to nautilus and konqueror integration.
  * diffdriver: New git-annex command, to make git external diff drivers
    work with annexed files.
  * pre-commit: Block partial commit of unlocked annexed file, since
    that left a typechange staged in index due to some infelicity of git's
    handling of partial commits.
  * Work around behavior change in lsof 4.88's -F output format.
  * S3: Switched to using the haskell aws library.
  * S3: No longer buffers entire files in memory when uploading without
    chunking.
  * S3: When built with a new enough version of the haskell aws library,
    supports doing multipart uploads, in order to store extremely large
    files in S3 when not using chunking.
  * Don't show "(gpg)" when decrypting the remote encryption cipher,
    since this could be taken to read that's the only time git-annex
    runs gpg, which is not the case.
  * Debian package is now maintained by Gergely Nagy.
  * Windows: Remove Alt+A keyboard shortcut, which turns out to have scope

  * New chunk= option to chunk files stored in special remotes.
    Supported by: directory, S3, webdav, gcrypt, rsync, and all external
    and hook special remotes.
  * Partially transferred files are automatically resumed when using
    chunked remotes!
  * The old chunksize= option is deprecated. Do not use for new remotes.
  * Legacy code for directory remotes using the old chunksize= option
    will keep them working, but more slowly than before.
  * webapp: Automatically install Konqueror integration scripts
    to get and drop files.
  * repair: Removing bad objects could leave fsck finding no more
    unreachable objects, but some branches no longer accessible.
    Fix this, including support for fixing up repositories that
    were incompletely repaired before.
  * Fix cost calculation for non-encrypted remotes.
  * Display exception message when a transfer fails due to an exception.
  * WebDAV: Sped up by avoiding making multiple http connections
    when storing a file.
  * WebDAV: Avoid buffering whole file in memory when uploading and
    downloading.
  * WebDAV: Dropped support for DAV before 1.0.
  * testremote: New command to test uploads/downloads to a remote.
  * Dropping an object from a bup special remote now deletes the git branch
    for the object, although of course the object's content cannot be deleted
    due to the nature of bup.
  * unlock: Better error handling; continue past files that are not available
    or cannot be unlocked due to disk space, and try all specified files.
  * Windows: Now uses actual inode equivilants in new direct mode
    repositories, for safer detection of eg, renaming of files with the same
    size and mtime.
  * direct: Fix ugly warning messages.
  * WORM backend: When adding a file in a subdirectory, avoid including the
    subdirectory in the key name.
  * S3, Glacier, WebDAV: Fix bug that prevented accessing the creds
    when the repository was configured with encryption=shared embedcreds=yes.
  * direct: Avoid leaving file content in misctemp if interrupted.
  * git-annex-shell sendkey: Don't fail if a remote asks for a key to be sent
    that already has a transfer lock file indicating it's being sent to that
    remote. The remote may have moved between networks, or reconnected.

  * resolvemerge: New plumbing command that runs the automatic merge conflict
    resolver.
  * Deal with change in git 2.0 that made indirect mode merge conflict
    resolution leave behind old files.
  * sync: Fix git sync with local git remotes even when they don't have an
    annex.uuid set. (The assistant already did so.)
  * Set gcrypt-publish-participants when setting up a gcrypt repository,
    to avoid unncessary passphrase prompts.
    This is a security/usability tradeoff. To avoid exposing the gpg key
    ids who can decrypt the repository, users can unset
    gcrypt-publish-participants.
  * Install nautilus hooks even when ~/.local/share/nautilus/ does not yet
    exist, since it is not automatically created for Gnome 3 users.

    the cheapest available.
  * webapp: More robust startup when annex directory is not a git repo.
  * initremote/enableremote: Basic support for using with regular git remotes;
    initremote stores the location of an already existing git remote,
    and enableremote setups up a remote using its stored location.
  * webapp: Support for enabling known git repositories on ssh servers.
    The repository must have been added using initremote.
  * webapp: When setting up a ssh remote, record it using initremote,
    so that it can be easily enabled elsewhere.
  * webapp: When setting up a ssh remote, if the user inputs ~/foo,
    normalize that to foo, since it's in the home directory by default.

  * Allow --all to be mixed with matching options like --copies and --in
    (but not --include and --exclude).
  * numcopies: New command, sets global numcopies value that is seen by all
    clones of a repository.
  * The annex.numcopies git config setting is deprecated. Once the numcopies
    command is used to set the global number of copies, any annex.numcopies
    git configs will be ignored.
  * assistant: Make the prefs page set the global numcopies.
  * Add lackingcopies, approxlackingcopies, and unused to
    preferred content expressions.
  * Client, transfer, incremental backup, and archive repositories
    now want to get content that does not yet have enough copies.
  * Client, transfer, and source repositories now do not want to retain
    unused file contents.
  * assistant: Checks daily for unused file contents, and when possible
    moves them to a repository (such as a backup repository) that
    wants to retain them.
  * assistant: annex.expireunused can be configured to cause unused
    file contents to be deleted after some period of time.
  * webapp: Nudge user to see if they want to expire old unused file
    contents when a lot of them seem to be piling up in the repository.
  * repair: Check git version at run time.
  * assistant: Run the periodic git gc in batch mode.
  * added annex.secure-erase-command config option.
  * test suite: Use tasty-rerun, and expose tasty command-line options.
  * Optimise non-bare http remotes; no longer does a 404 to the wrong
    url every time before trying the right url. Needs annex-bare to be
    set to false, which is done when initially probing the uuid of a
    http remote.
  * webapp: After upgrading a git repository to git-annex, fix
    bug that made it temporarily not be synced with.
  * whereis: Support --all.
  * All commands that support --all also support a --key option,
    which limits them to acting on a single key.

git-annex (5.20140116) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Added tahoe special remote.
  * external special remote protocol: Added GETGITDIR, and GETAVAILABILITY.
  * Refuse to build with git older than 1.7.1.1, which is needed for
    git checkout -B
  * map: Fix display of v5 direct mode repos.
  * repair: Support old git versions from before git fsck --no-dangling was
    implemented.
  * Fix a long-standing bug that could cause the wrong index file to be used
    when committing to the git-annex branch, if GIT_INDEX_FILE is set in the
    environment. This typically resulted in git-annex branch log files being
    committed to the master branch and later showing up in the work tree.
    (These log files can be safely removed.)
  * assistant: Detect if .git/annex/index is corrupt at startup, and
    recover.
  * repair: Fix bug in packed refs file exploding code that caused a .gitrefs
    directory to be created instead of .git/refs
  * Fix FTBFS on mipsel and sparc due to test suite not being available
    on those architectures.

  * external special remote protocol: Added GETUUID, GETWANTED, SETWANTED,
    SETSTATE, GETSTATE, DEBUG.
  * Windows: Fix bug in direct mode merge code that could cause files
    in subdirectories to go missing.
  * Windows: Avoid eating stdin when running ssh to add a authorized key,
    since this is used for password prompting.
  * Avoid looping if long-running git cat-file or git hash-object crashes
    and keeps crashing when restarted.
  * Assistant: Remove stale MERGE_HEAD files in lockfile cleanup.
  * Remotes can now be made read-only, by setting remote.<name>.annex-readonly
  * wanted, schedule: Avoid printing "ok" after requested value.
  * assistant: Ensure that .ssh/config and .ssh/authorized_keys are not
    group or world writable when writing to those files, as that can make
    ssh refuse to use them, if it allows another user to write to them.
  * addurl, importfeed: Honor annex.diskreserve as long as the size of the
    url can be checked.
  * add: Fix rollback when disk is completely full.
  * assistant: Fixed several minor memory leaks that manifested when
    adding a large number of files.
  * assistant: Start a new git-annex transferkeys process
    after a network connection change, so that remotes that use a persistent
    network connection are restarted.

  * Fix typo in test suite.
  * Fix bug in Linux standalone build's shimming that broke git-annex-shell.
  * Include git-receive-pack, git-upload-pack, git, and git-shell wrappers
    in the Linux standalone build, and OSX app, so they will be available
    when it's added to PATH.
  * addurl, importfeed: Sanitize | and some other symbols and special
    characters.
  * Auto-upgrade v3 indirect repos to v5 with no changes.
    This also fixes a problem when a direct mode repo was somehow set to v3
    rather than v4, and so the automatic direct mode upgrade to v5 was not
    done.
  * Android: Avoid trying to use Android's own ionice, which does not
    allow specifying a command to run. Fixes transferring files to/from
    android and probably a few other things.

    follow symlinks to other directories, and add their contents to the annex.
  * assistant: Set StrictHostKeyChecking yes when creating ssh remotes,
    and add it to the configuration for any ssh remotes previously created
    by the assistant. This avoids repeated prompts by ssh if the host key
    changes, instead syncing with such a remote will fail. Closes: #732602
  * Fix test suite to cover lock --force change.
  * Add plumbing-level lookupkey and examinekey commands.
  * find --format: Added hashdirlower, hashdirmixed, keyname, and mtime
    format variables.
  * assistant: Always batch changes found in startup scan.
  * An armel Linux standalone build is now available, which includes the
    webapp.
  * Programs from Linux and OSX standalone builds can now be symlinked
    into a directory in PATH as an alternative installation method, and will
    use readlink to find where the build was unpacked.
  * Include man pages in Linux and OSX standalone builds.
  * Linux standalone build now includes its own glibc and forces the linker to
    use it, to remove dependence on the host glibc.

  * assistant: Run transferkeys as batch jobs.
  * Automatically fix up bad bare repositories created by
    versions 5.20131118 through 5.20131127.
  * rsync special remote: Fix fallback mode for rsync remotes that
    use hashDirMixed. Closes: #731142
  * copy --from, get --from: When --force is used, ignore the
    location log and always try to get the file from the remote.
  * Deal with box.com changing the url of their webdav endpoint.
  * Android: Fix SRV record lookups for XMPP to use android getprop
    command to find DNS server, since there is no resolv.conf.
  * import: Add --skip-duplicates option.
  * lock: Require --force. Closes: #731606
  * import: better handling of overwriting an existing file/directory/broken
    link when importing
  * Windows: assistant and webapp work! (very experimental)
  * Windows: Support annex.diskreserve.
  * Fix bad behavior in Firefox, which was caused by an earlier fix to
    bad behavior in Chromium.
  * repair: Improve repair of git-annex index file.
  * repair: Remove damaged git-annex sync branches.
  * status: Ignore new files that are gitignored.
  * Fix direct mode's handling when modifications to non-annexed files
    are pulled from a remote. A bug prevented the files from being updated
    in the work tree, and this caused the modification to be reverted.
  * OSX: Remove ssh and ssh-keygen from dmg as they're included in OSX by
    default.

  * webapp: Detect when upgrades are available, and upgrade if the user
    desires.
    (Only when git-annex is installed using the prebuilt binaries
    from git-annex upstream, not from eg Debian.)
  * assistant: Detect when the git-annex binary is modified or replaced,
    and either prompt the user to restart the program, or automatically
    restart it.
  * annex.autoupgrade configures both the above upgrade behaviors.
  * Added support for quvi 0.9. Slightly suboptimal due to limitations in its
    interface compared with the old version.
  * Bug fix: annex.version did not get set on automatic upgrade to v5 direct
    mode repo, so the upgrade was performed repeatedly, slowing commands down.
  * webapp: Fix bug that broke switching between local repositories
    that use the new guarded direct mode.
  * Android: Fix stripping of the git-annex binary.
  * Android: Make terminal app show git-annex version number.
  * Android: Re-enable XMPP support.
  * reinject: Allow to be used in direct mode.
  * Futher improvements to git repo repair. Has now been tested in tens
    of thousands of intentionally damaged repos, and successfully

git-annex (5.20131118) unstable; urgency=low

  * Direct mode repositories now have core.bare=true set, to prevent
    accidentally running git commands that try to operate on the work tree,
    and so do the wrong thing in direct mode.
  * annex.version is now set to 5 for direct mode repositories.
    This upgrade is handled fully automatically, no need to run
    git annex upgrade
  * The "status" command has been renamed to "info", to allow
    "git annex status" to be used in direct mode repositories, now that
    "git status" won't work in them.
  * The -c option now not only modifies the git configuration seen by
    git-annex, but it is passed along to every git command git-annex runs.
  * watcher: Avoid loop when adding a file owned by someone else fails
    in indirect mode because its permissions cannot be modified.
  * webapp: Avoid encoding problems when displaying the daemon log file.
  * webapp: Improve UI around remote that have no annex.uuid set,
    either because setup of them is incomplete, or because the remote
    git repository is not a git-annex repository.
  * Include ssh-keygen in standalone bundle.
  * Allow optionally configuring git-annex with -fEKG to enable awesome
    remote monitoring interfaceat http://localhost:4242/
  * Fix bug that caused bad information to be written to the git-annex branch
    when running describe or other commands with a remote that has no uuid.
  * Work around Android linker problem that had prevented git-annex from
    running on Android 4.3 and 4.4.
  * repair: Handle case where index file is corrupt, but all objects are ok.
  * assistant: Notice on startup when the index file is corrupt, and
    auto-repair.
  * Fix direct mode merge bug when a direct mode file was deleted and replaced
    with a directory. An ordering problem caused the directory to not get
    created in this case.
    Thanks to Tim for the test case.
  * Direct mode .git/annex/objects directories are no longer left writable,
    because that allowed writing to symlinks of files that are not present,
    which followed the link and put bad content in an object location.
    Thanks to Tim for the test case.
  * fsck: Fix up .git/annex/object directory permissions.

  * sync: Show a hint about receive.denyNonFastForwards when a push fails.
  * directory, webdav: Fix bug introduced in version 4.20131002 that
    caused the chunkcount file to not be written. Work around repositories
    without such a file, so files can still be retreived from them.
  * assistant: Automatically repair damanged git repository, if it can
    be done without losing data.
  * assistant: Support repairing git remotes that are locally accessible
    (eg, on removable drives).
  * add: Fix reversion in 4.20130827 when adding unlocked files that have
    not yet been committed.
  * unannex: New, much slower, but more safe behavior: Copies files out of
    the annex. This avoids an unannex of one file breaking other files that
    link to the same content. Also, it means that the content
    remains in the annex using up space until cleaned up with 
    "git annex unused".
    (The behavior of unannex --fast has not changed; it still hard links
    to content in the annex. --fast was not made the default because it is
    potentially unsafe; editing such a hard linked file can unexpectedly
    change content stored in the annex.)

    repository and remotes. These can be configured using vicfg or with the
    webapp.
  * repair: New command, which can repair damaged git repositories

  * webapp: When git repository damange is detected, repairs can be
    done using the webapp UI.
  * Automatically and safely detect and recover from dangling
    .git/annex/index.lock files, which would prevent git from
    committing to the git-annex branch, eg after a crash.
  * assistant: Detect stale git lock files at startup time, and remove them.
  * addurl: Better sanitization of generated filenames.
  * Better sanitization of problem characters when generating URL and WORM
    keys.
  * The control socket path passed to ssh needs to be 17 characters
    shorter than the maximum unix domain socket length, because ssh
    appends stuff to it to make a temporary filename. Closes: #725512
  * status: Fix space leak in local mode, introduced in version 4.20130920.
  * import: Skip .git directories.
  * Remove bogus runshell loop check.
  * addurl: Improve message when adding url with wrong size to existing file.

  * Deal with git check-attr -z output format change in git 1.8.5.
  * Work around sed output difference that led to version containing a newline
    on OSX.
  * sync: Fix automatic resolution of merge conflicts where one side is an
    annexed file, and the other side is a non-annexed file, or a directory.
  * S3: Try to ensure bucket name is valid for archive.org.
  * assistant: Bug fix: When run in a subdirectory, files from incoming merges
    were wrongly added to that subdirectory, and removed from their original
    locations.
  * Windows: Deal with strange msysgit 1.8.4 behavior of not understanding
    DOS formatted paths for --git-dir and --work-tree.

  * webapp: Support setting up and using encrypted git repositories on
    any ssh server, as well as on rsync.net.
  * git-annex-shell: Added support for operating inside gcrypt repositories.
  * Disable receive.denyNonFastForwards when setting up a gcrypt special
    remote, since gcrypt needs to be able to fast-forward the master branch.
  * import: Preserve top-level directory structure.
  * Use cryptohash rather than SHA for hashing when no external hash program
    is available. This is a significant speedup for SHA256 on OSX, for
    example.
  * Added SKEIN256 and SKEIN512 backends.
  * Android build redone from scratch, many dependencies updated,
    and entire build can now be done using provided scripts.
  * assistant: Clear the list of failed transfers when doing a full transfer
    scan. This prevents repeated retries to download files that are not
    available, or are not referenced by the current git tree.
  * indirect, direct: Better behavior when a file is not owned by
    the user running the conversion.
  * add, import, assistant: Better preserve the mtime of symlinks,

  * Send a git-annex user-agent when downloading urls.
    Overridable with --user-agent option.
    (Not yet done for S3 or WebDAV due to limitations of libraries used.)
  * webapp: Fixed a bug where when a new remote is added, one file
    may fail to sync to or from it due to the transferrer process not
    yet knowing about the new remote.
  * OSX: Bundled gpg upgraded, now compatible with config files
    written by MacGPG.

    sync.
  * addurl: Fix quvi audodetection, broken in last release.
  * status: In local mode, displays information about variance from configured
    numcopies levels. (--fast avoids calculating these)
  * gcrypt: Ensure that signing key is set to one of the participants keys.

  * forget --drop-dead: Completely removes mentions of repositories that
    have been marked as dead from the git-annex branch.
  * sync, assistant: Force push of the git-annex branch. Necessary
    to ensure it gets pushed to remotes after being rewritten by forget.
  * Added gcrypt support. This combines a fully encrypted git
    repository (using git-remote-gcrypt) with an encrypted git-annex special
    remote.
  * sync: Support syncing with gcrypt remotes.
  * importfeed: Also ignore transient problems with downloading content
    from feeds.
  * Honor core.sharedrepository when receiving and adding files in direct

  * enableremote: gpg keys can be removed from those a remote encrypts
    to by passing "keyid-=$KEYID". keyid+= is also provided.
    (Thanks, guilhem for the patch.)
  * Added encryption=pubkey scheme, which encrypts to public keys directly
    rather than the hybrid approach. See documentation for advantages
    and disadvantages, but encryption=hybrid is the recommended scheme still.
    (Thanks, guilhem for the patch.)
  * Fix Feeds display in build flags.
  * Remind user when annex-ignore is set for some remotes, if unable to
    get or drop a file, possibly because it's on an ignored remote.
  * gpg: Force --no-textmode in case the user has it turned on in config.
  * webapp: Improve javascript's handling of longpolling connection
    failures, by reloading the current page in this case.
    Works around chromium behavior where ajax connections to urls

    honored, when git 1.8.4 or newer is installed.
    (Thanks, Adam Spiers, for getting the necessary support into git for this.)
  * importfeed: Ignores transient problems with feeds. Only exits nonzero
    when a feed has repeatedly had a problems for at least 1 day.
  * importfeed: Fix handling of dots in extensions.
  * Windows: Added support for encrypted special remotes.
  * Windows: Fixed permissions problem that prevented removing files
    from directory special remote. Directory special remotes now fully usable.

git-annex (4.20130802) unstable; urgency=low

  * dropunused behavior change: Now refuses to drop the last copy of a
    file, unless you use the --force.
    This was the last place in git-annex that could remove data referred
    to by the git history, without being forced.
    Like drop, dropunused checks remotes, and honors the global
    annex.numcopies setting. (However, .gitattributes settings cannot
    apply to unused files.) 
  * Fix inverted logic in last release's fix for data loss bug,
    that caused git-annex sync on FAT or other crippled filesystems to add
    symlink standin files to the annex.
  * importfeed can be used to import files from podcast feeds.
  * webapp: When setting up a dedicated ssh key to access the annex
    on a host, set IdentitiesOnly to prevent the ssh-agent from forcing
    use of a different ssh key. That could result in unncessary password
    prompts, or prevent git-annex-shell from being run on the remote host.
  * webapp: Improve handling of remotes whose setup has stalled.
  * Add status message to XMPP presence tag, to identify to others that
    the client is a git-annex client. Closes: #717652
  * webapp: When creating a repository on a removable drive, set
    core.fsyncobjectfiles, to help prevent data loss when the drive is yanked.
  * Always build with -threaded, to avoid a deadlock when communicating with
    gpg.
  * unused: No longer shows as unused tmp files that are actively being
    transferred.
  * assistant: Fix NetWatcher to not sync with remotes that have
    remote.<name>.annex-sync set to false.
  * assistant: Fix deadlock that could occur when adding a lot of files
    at once in indirect mode.
  * assistant: Fix bug that caused it to stall when adding a very large
    number of files at once (around 5 thousand).
  * OSX: Make git-annex-webapp run in the background, so that the app icon
    can be clicked on the open a new webapp when the assistant is already
    running.
  * Improve test suite on Windows; now tests git annex sync.
  * Fix a few bugs involving filenames that are at or near the filesystem's
    maximum filename length limit.
  * find: Avoid polluting stdout with progress messages. Closes: #718186
  * Escape ':' in file/directory names to avoid it being treated
    as a pathspec by some git commands. Closes: #718185
  * Slow and ugly work around for bug #718517 in git 1.8.4~rc0, which broke
    git-cat-file --batch for filenames containing spaces.
    (Will be reverted after next git pre-release fixes the problem.)

git-annex (4.20130723) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix data loss bug when adding an (uncompressed) tarball of a
    git-annex repository, or other file that begins with something
    that can be mistaken for a git-annex link. Closes: #717456
  * New improved version of the git-annex logo, contributed by
    John Lawrence.
  * Rsync.net have committed to support git-annex and offer a special
    discounted rate for git-annex users. Updated the webapp to reflect this.
    http://www.rsync.net/products/git-annex-pricing.html
  * Install XDG desktop icon files.
  * Support unannex and uninit in direct mode.
  * Support import in direct mode.
  * webapp: Better display of added files.
  * fix: Preserve the original mtime of fixed symlinks.
  * uninit: Preserve .git/annex/objects at the end, if it still
    has content, so that old versions of files and deleted files
    are not deleted. Print a message with some suggested actions.
  * When a transfer is already being run by another process,
    proceed on to the next file, rather than dying.
  * Fix checking when content is present in a non-bare repository
    accessed via http.
  * Display byte sizes with more precision.
  * watcher: Fixed a crash that could occur when a directory was renamed
    or deleted before it could be scanned.
  * watcher: Partially worked around a bug in hinotify, no longer crashes
    if hinotify cannot process a directory (but can't detect changes in it)
  * directory special remote: Fix checking that there is enough disk space
    to hold an object, was broken when using encryption.
  * webapp: Differentiate between creating a new S3/Glacier/WebDav remote,
    and initializing an existing remote. When creating a new remote, avoid
    conflicts with other existing (or deleted) remotes with the same name.
  * When an XMPP server has SRV records, try them, but don't then fall
    back to the regular host if they all fail.
  * For long hostnames, use a hash of the hostname to generate the socket
    file for ssh connection caching.

git-annex (4.20130709) unstable; urgency=low

  * --all: New switch that makes git-annex operate on all data stored
    in the git annex, including old versions of files. Supported by
    fsck, get, move, copy.
  * --unused: New switch that makes git-annex operate on all data found
    by the last run of git annex unused. Supported by fsck, move, copy.
  * get, move, copy: Can now be run in a bare repository,
    like fsck already could. --all is enabled automatically in this case.
  * merge: Now also merges synced/master or similar branches, which 
    makes it useful to put in a post-receive hook to make a repository
    automatically update its working copy when git annex sync or the assistant
    sync with it.
  * webapp: Fix ssh setup with nonstandard port, broken in last release.
  * init: Detect systems on which git commit fails due to not being able to
    determine the FQDN, and put in a workaround so committing to the git-annex
    branch works.
  * addurl --pathdepth: Fix failure when the pathdepth specified is deeper
    than the urls's path.
  * Windows: Look for .exe extension when searching for a command in path.
  * Pass -f to curl when downloading a file with it, so it propigates failure. 
  * Windows: Fix url to object when using a http remote.
  * webapp: Fix authorized_keys line added when setting up a rsync remote
    on a server that also supports git-annex, to not force running
    git-annex-shell.
  * OSX Mountain Lion: Fixed gpg bundled in dmg to not fail due to a missing
    gpg-agent.
  * Android: gpg is built without --enable-minimal, so it interoperates
    better with other gpg builds that may default to using other algorithms
    for encryption.
  * dropunused, addunused: Complain when asked to operate on a number that
    does not correspond to any unused key.
  * fsck: Don't claim to fix direct mode when run on a symlink whose content
    is not present.
  * Make --numcopies override annex.numcopies set in .gitattributes.

git-annex (4.20130627) unstable; urgency=low

  * assistant --autostart: Automatically ionices the daemons it starts.
  * assistant: Daily sanity check thread is run niced.
  * bup: Handle /~/ in bup remote paths.
    Thanks, Oliver Matthews
  * fsck: Ensures that direct mode is used for files when it's enabled.
  * webapp: Fix bug when setting up a remote ssh repo repeatedly on the same
    server.
  * webapp: Ensure that ssh keys generated for different directories
    on a server are always different.
  * webapp: Fix bug setting up ssh repo if the user enters "~/" at the start 
    of the path.
  * assistant: Fix bug that prevented adding files written by gnucash, 
    and more generally support adding hard links to files. However,
    other operations on hard links are still unsupported.
  * webapp: Fix bug that caused the webapp to hang when built with yesod 1.2.

git-annex (4.20130621) unstable; urgency=low

  * Supports indirect mode on encfs in paranoia mode, and other
    filesystems that do not support hard links, but do support
    symlinks and other POSIX filesystem features.
  * Android: Add .thumbnails to .gitignore when setting up a camera
    repository.
  * Android: Make the "Open webapp" menu item open the just created
    repository when a new repo is made.
  * webapp: When the user switches to display a different repository,
    that repository becomes the default repository to be displayed next time
    the webapp gets started.
  * glacier: Better handling of the glacier inventory, which avoids
    duplicate uploads to the same glacier repository by `git annex copy`.
  * Direct mode: No longer temporarily remove write permission bit of files
    when adding them.
  * sync: Better support for bare git remotes. Now pushes directly to the
    master branch on such a remote, instead of to synced/master. This
    makes it easier to clone from a bare git remote that has been populated
    with git annex sync or by the assistant.
  * Android: Fix use of cp command to not try to use features present
    only on build system.
  * Windows: Fix hang when adding several files at once.
  * assistant: In direct mode, objects are now only dropped when all
    associated files are unwanted. This avoids a repreated drop/get loop
    of a file that has a copy in an archive directory, and a copy not in an
    archive directory. (Indirect mode still has some buggy behavior in this
    area, since it does not keep track of associated files.)
    Closes: #712060
  * status: No longer shows dead repositories.
  * annex.debug can now be set to enable debug logging by default.
    The webapp's debugging check box does this.
  * fsck: Avoid getting confused by Windows path separators
  * Windows: Multiple bug fixes, including fixing the data written to the
    git-annex branch.
  * Windows: The test suite now passes on Windows (a few broken parts are
    disabled).
  * assistant: On Linux, the expensive transfer scan is run niced.
  * Enable assistant and WebDAV support on powerpc and sparc architectures,
    which now have the necessary dependencies built.

git-annex (4.20130601) unstable; urgency=medium

  * XMPP: Git push over xmpp made much more robust.
  * XMPP: Avoid redundant and unncessary pushes. Note that this breaks
    compatibility with previous versions of git-annex, which will refuse
    to accept any XMPP pushes from this version.
  * XMPP: Send pings and use them to detect when contact with the server
    is lost.
  * hook special remote: Added combined hook program support.
  * Android app: Avoid using hard links to app's lib directory, which
    is sometimes on a different filesystem than the data directory.
  * Fix bug in parsing of parens in some preferred content expressions.
    This fixes the behavior of the manual mode group.
  * assistant: Work around git-cat-file's not reloading the index after files
    are staged.
  * Improve error handling when getting uuid of http remotes to auto-ignore,
    like with ssh remotes.
  * content: New command line way to view and configure a repository's
    preferred content settings.
  * sync: Fix double merge conflict resolution handling.
  * XMPP: Fix a file descriptor leak.
  * Android: Added an "Open WebApp" item to the terminal's menu.
  * Android: Work around Android devices where the `am` command doesn't work.
  * Can now restart certain long-running git processes if they crash, and
    continue working.

  * Sanitize debian changelog version before putting it into cabal file.
    Closes: #708619
  * Switch to MonadCatchIO-transformers for better handling of state while
    catching exceptions.
  * Fix a zombie that could result when running a process like gpg to
    read and write to it.
  * Allow building with gpg2.
  * Disable building with the haskell threaded runtime when the webapp
    is not built. This may fix builds on mips, s390x and sparc, which are
    failing to link -lHSrts_thr
  * Temporarily build without webapp on kfreebsd-i386, until yesod is
    installable there again.
  * Direct mode bug fix: After a conflicted merge was automatically resolved,
    the content of a file that was already present could incorrectly
    be replaced with a symlink.
  * Fix a bug in the git-annex branch handling code that could
    cause info from a remote to not be merged and take effect immediately.
  * Direct mode is now fully tested by the test suite.
  * Detect bad content in ~/.config/git-annex/program and look in PATH instead.
  * OSX: Fixed gpg included in dmg.
  * Linux standalone: Back to being built with glibc 2.13 for maximum
    portability.

git-annex (4.20130516) unstable; urgency=low

  * Android: The webapp is ported and working.
  * Windows: There is a very rough Windows port. Do not trust it with
    important data.
  * git-annex-shell: Ensure that received files can be read. Files
    transferred from some Android devices may have very broken permissions
    as received.
  * direct mode: Direct mode commands now work on files staged in the index,
    they do not need to be committed to git.
  * Temporarily add an upper bound to the version of yesod that can be built
    with, since yesod 1.2 has a great many changes that will require extensive
    work on the webapp.
  * Disable building with the haskell threaded runtime when the assistant
    is not built. This may fix builds on s390x and sparc, which are failing
    to link -lHSrts_thr
  * Avoid depending on regex-tdfa on mips, mipsel, and s390, where it fails
    to build.
  * direct: Fix a bug that could cause some files to be left in indirect mode.
  * When initializing a directory special remote with a relative path,
    the path is made absolute.
  * SHA: Add a runtime sanity check that sha commands output something
    that appears to be a real sha.
  * configure: Better checking that sha commands output in the desired format.
  * rsync special remotes: When sending from a crippled filesystem, use
    the destination's default file permissions, as the local ones can
    be arbitrarily broken. (Ie, ----rwxr-x for files on Android)
  * migrate: Detect if a file gets corrupted while it's being migrated.
  * Debian: Add a menu file.

git-annex (4.20130501) unstable; urgency=low

  * sync, assistant: Behavior changes: Sync with remotes that have
    annex-ignore set, so that git remotes on servers without git-annex
    installed can be used to keep clients' git repos in sync.
  * assistant: Work around misfeature in git 1.8.2 that makes
    `git commit --alow-empty -m ""` run an editor.
  * sync: Bug fix, avoid adding to the annex the 
    dummy symlinks used on crippled filesystems.
  * Add public repository group.
    (And inpreferreddir to preferred content expressions.)
  * webapp: Can now set up Internet Archive repositories.
  * S3: Dropping content from the Internet Archive doesn't work, but
    their API indicates it does. Always refuse to drop from there.
  * Automatically register public urls for files uploaded to the
    Internet Archive.
  * To enable an existing special remote, the new enableremote command
    must be used. The initremote command now is used only to create
    new special remotes.
  * initremote: If two existing remotes have the same name,
    prefer the one with a higher trust level.
  * assistant: Improved XMPP protocol to better support multiple repositories
    using the same XMPP account. Fixes bad behavior when sharing with a friend
    when you or the friend have multiple reposotories on an XMPP account.
    Note that XMPP pairing with your own devices still pairs with all
    repositories using your XMPP account.
  * assistant: Fix bug that could cause incoming pushes to not get
    merged into the local tree. Particularly affected XMPP pushes.
  * webapp: Display some additional information about a repository on
    its edit page.
  * webapp: Install FDO desktop menu file when started in standalone mode.
  * webapp: Don't default to making repository in cwd when started
    from within a directory containing a git-annex file (eg, standalone
    tarball directory).
  * Detect systems that have no user name set in GECOS, and also
    don't have user.name set in git config, and put in a workaround
    so that commits to the git-annex branch (and the assistant)
    will still succeed despite git not liking the system configuration.
  * webapp: When told to add a git repository on a remote server, and
    the repository already exists as a non-bare repository, use it,
    rather than initializing a bare repository in the same directory.
  * direct, indirect: Refuse to do anything when the assistant
    or git-annex watch daemon is running.
  * assistant: When built with git before 1.8.0, use `git remote rm`
    to delete a remote. Newer git uses `git remote remove`.
  * rmurl: New command, removes one of the recorded urls for a file.
  * Detect when the remote is broken like bitbucket is, and exits 0 when
    it fails to run git-annex-shell.
  * assistant: Several improvements to performance and behavior when
    performing bulk adds of a large number of files (tens to hundreds
    of thousands).
  * assistant: Sanitize XMPP presence information logged for debugging.
  * webapp: Now automatically fills in any creds used by an existing remote
    when creating a new remote of the same type. Done for Internet Archive,
    S3, Glacier, and Box.com remotes.
  * Store an annex-uuid file in the bucket when setting up a new S3 remote.
  * Support building with DAV 0.4.

  * initremote: Generates encryption keys with high quality entropy.
    This can be disabled using --fast to get the old behavior.
    The assistant still uses low-quality entropy when creating encrypted
    remotes, to avoid delays. (Thanks, guilhem for the patch.)
  * Bugfix: Direct mode no longer repeatedly checksums duplicated files.
  * assistant: Work around horrible, terrible, very bad behavior of
    gnome-keyring, by not storing special-purpose ssh keys in ~/.ssh/*.pub.
    Apparently gnome-keyring apparently will load and indiscriminately use
    such keys in some cases, even if they are not using any of the standard
    ssh key names. Instead store the keys in ~/.ssh/annex/,
    which gnome-keyring will not check.
  * addurl: Bugfix: Did not properly add file in direct mode.
  * assistant: Bug fix to avoid annexing the files that git uses
    to stand in for symlinks on FAT and other filesystem not supporting
    symlinks.
  * Adjust preferred content expressions so that content in archive
    directories is preferred until it has reached an archive or smallarchive
    repository.
  * webapp: New --listen= option allows running the webapp on one computer
    and connecting to it from another. (Note: Does not yet use HTTPS.)
  * Added annex.web-download-command setting.
  * Added per-remote annex-rsync-transport option. (guilhem again)
  * Ssh connection caching is now also used by rsync special remotes.
    (guilhem yet again)
  * The version number is now derived from git, unless built with
    VERSION_FROM_CHANGELOG.
  * assistant: Stop any transfers the assistant initiated on shutdown.
  * assistant: Added sequence numbers to XMPP git push packets. (Not yet used.)
  * addurl: Register transfer so the webapp can see it.
  * addurl: Automatically retry downloads that fail, as long as some
    additional content was downloaded.
  * webapp: Much improved progress bar display for downloads from encrypted
    remotes.
  * Avoid using runghc, as that needs ghci.
  * webapp: When a repository's group is changed, rescan for transfers.
  * webapp: Added animations.
  * webapp: Include the repository directory in the mangled hostname and
    ssh key name, so that a locked down ssh key for one repository is not
    re-used when setting up additional repositories on the same server.
  * Fall back to internal url downloader when built without curl.
  * fsck: Check content of direct mode files (only when the inode cache
    thinks they are unmodified).

    to encrypt filenames.
    Thanks, guilhem for the patch.

    repositories.
  * assistant: Fix bug that could cause direct mode files to be unstaged
    from git.

    a ssh server, rather than just funneling them through to rsync.
  * xmpp: --debug now enables a sanitized dump of the XMPP protocol
  * xmpp: Try harder to detect presence of clients when there's a git push
    to send.
  * xmpp: Re-enable XA flag, since disabling it did not turn out to help

    messages to clients.
  * map: Combine duplicate repositories, for a nicer looking map.
  * Fix several bugs caused by a bad Ord instance for Remote.

  * Bugfix: drop --from an unavailable remote no longer updates the location
    log, incorrectly, to say the remote does not have the key.
  * Bugfix: If the UUID of a remote is not known, prevent --from, --to,
    and other ways of specifying remotes by name from selecting it,
    since it is not possible to sanely use it.
  * Bugfix: Fix bug in inode cache sentinal check, which broke
    copying to local repos if the repo being copied from had moved
    to a different filesystem or otherwise changed all its inodes

  * Switch from using regex-compat to regex-tdfa, as the C regex library
    is rather buggy.
  * status: Can now be run with a directory path to show only the

  * assistant: Logs are rotated to avoid them using too much disk space.
  * assistant: Avoid noise in logs from git commit about typechanged

    combines all their changes into a single commit.
  * assistant: Fix ~/.ssh/git-annex-shell wrapper to work when the
    ssh key does not force a command.
  * assistant: Be smarter about avoiding unncessary transfers.

  * webapp: Work around bug in Warp's slowloris attack prevention code,
    that caused regular browsers to stall when they reuse a connection
    after leaving it idle for 30 seconds.
    (See https://github.com/yesodweb/wai/issues/146)
  * webapp: New preferences page allows enabling/disabling debug logging
    at runtime, as well as configuring numcopies and diskreserve.
  * webapp: Repository costs can be configured by dragging repositories around
    in the repository list.

    always using git's pseudosymlink files in such repositories.
  * webapp: Allow creating repositories on filesystems that lack support for
    symlinks.
  * webapp: Can now add a new local repository, and make it sync with
    the main local repository.
  * Android: Bundle now includes openssh.
  * Android: Support ssh connection caching.
  * Android: Assistant is fully working. (But no webapp yet.)
  * Direct mode: Support filesystems like FAT which can change their inodes
    each time they are mounted.
  * Direct mode: Fix support for adding a modified file.
  * Avoid passing -p to rsync, to interoperate with crippled filesystems.
    Closes: #700282
  * Additional GIT_DIR support bugfixes. May actually work now.
  * webapp: Display any error message from git init if it fails to create
    a repository.
  * Fix a reversion in matching globs introduced in the last release,
    where "*" did not match files inside subdirectories. No longer uses
    the Glob library.

    log was out of date.
  * Makefile now builds using cabal, taking advantage of cabal's automatic
    detection of appropriate build flags.

git-annex (3.20130216) unstable; urgency=low

  * Now uses the Haskell uuid library, rather than needing a uuid program.
  * Now uses the Haskell Glob library, rather than pcre-light, avoiding
    the need to install libpcre. Currently done only for Cabal or when
    the Makefile is made to use -DWITH_GLOB
  * Android port now available (command-line only).
  * New annex.crippledfilesystem setting, allows use of git-annex
    repositories on FAT and even worse filesystems; avoiding use of
    hard links and locked down permissions settings. (Support is incomplete.)
  * init: Detect when the repository is on a filesystem that does not
    support hard links, or symlinks, or unix permissions, and set
    annex.crippledfilesystem, as well as annex.direct.
  * add: Improved detection of files that are modified while being added.
  * Fix a bug in direct mode, introduced in the previous release, where
    if a file was dropped and then got back, it would be stored in indirect
    mode.

  * assistant: Fix location log when adding new file in direct mode.
  * Deal with stale mappings for deleted file in direct mode.
  * pre-commit: Update direct mode mappings.

git-annex (3.20130124) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added source repository group, that only retains files until they've
    been transferred to another repository. Useful for things like
    repositories on cameras.
  * Added manual repository group. Use to prevent the assistant from
    downloading any file contents to keep things in sync. Instead
    `git annex get`, `git annex drop` etc can be used manually as desired.
  * webapp: More adjustments to longpoll code to deal with changes in
    variable quoting in different versions of shakespeare-js.
  * webapp: Avoid an error if a transfer is stopped just as it finishes.
    Closes: #698184 
  * webapp: Now always logs to .git/annex/daemon.log
  * webapp: Has a page to view the log, accessed from the control menu.
  * webapp: Fix crash adding removable drive that has an annex directory
    in it that is not a git repository.
  * Deal with incompatability in gpg2, which caused prompts for encryption
    passphrases rather than using the supplied --passphrase-fd.
  * bugfix: Union merges involving two or more repositories could sometimes
    result in data from one repository getting lost. This could result
    in the location log data becoming wrong, and fsck being needed to fix it.
  * sync: Automatic merge conflict resolution now stages deleted files.
  * Depend on git 1.7.7.6 for --no-edit. Closes: #698399
  * Fix direct mode mapping code to always store direct mode filenames
    relative to the top of the repository, even when operating inside a
    subdirectory.
  * fsck: Detect and fix consistency errors in direct mode mapping files.
  * Avoid filename encoding errors when writing direct mode mappings.

git-annex (3.20130114) unstable; urgency=low

  * Now handles the case where a file that's being transferred to a remote
    is modified in place, which direct mode allows. When this
    happens, the transfer now fails, rather than allow possibly corrupt
    data into the remote.
  * fsck: Better checking of file content in direct mode.
  * drop: Suggest using git annex move when numcopies prevents dropping a file.
  * webapp: Repo switcher filters out repos that do not exist any more
    (or are on a drive that's not mounted).
  * webapp: Use IP address, rather than localhost, since some systems may
    have configuration problems or other issues that prevent web browsers
    from connecting to the right localhost IP for the webapp.
  * webapp: Adjust longpoll code to work with recent versions of
    shakespeare-js.
  * assistant: Support new gvfs dbus names used in Gnome 3.6.
  * In direct mode, files with the same key are no longer hardlinked, as
    that would cause a surprising behavior if modifying one, where the other
    would also change.
  * webapp: Avoid illegal characters in hostname when creating S3 or
    Glacier remote.
  * assistant: Avoid committer crashing if a file is deleted at the wrong
    instant.

  * webapp: Add UI to stop and restart assistant.
  * committer: Fix a file handle leak.
  * assistant: Make expensive transfer scan work fully in direct mode.
  * More commands work in direct mode repositories: find, whereis, move, copy,
    drop, log, fsck, add, addurl.
  * sync: No longer automatically adds files in direct mode.
  * assistant: Detect when system is not configured with a user name,
    and set environment to prevent git from failing.
  * direct: Avoid hardlinking symlinks that point to the same content
    when the content is not present.
  * Fix transferring files to special remotes in direct mode.

git-annex (3.20130102) unstable; urgency=low

  * direct, indirect: New commands, that switch a repository to and from
    direct mode. In direct mode, files are accessed directly, rather than
    via symlinks. Note that direct mode is currently experimental. Many
    git-annex commands do not work in direct mode. Some git commands can
    cause data loss when used in direct mode repositories.
  * assistant: Now uses direct mode by default when setting up a new
    local repository.
  * OSX assistant: Uses the FSEvents API to detect file changes.
    This avoids issues with running out of file descriptors on large trees,
    as well as allowing detection of modification of files in direct mode.
    Other BSD systems still use kqueue.
  * kqueue: Fix bug that made broken symlinks not be noticed.
  * vicfg: Quote filename. Closes: #696193
  * Bugfix: Fixed bug parsing transfer info files, where the newline after
    the filename was included in it. This was generally benign, but in
    the assistant, it caused unexpected dropping of preferred content.
  * Bugfix: Remove leading \ from checksums output by sha*sum commands,
    when the filename contains \ or a newline. Closes: #696384
  * fsck: Still accept checksums with a leading \ as valid, now that
    above bug is fixed.
  * SHA*E backends: Exclude non-alphanumeric characters from extensions.
  * migrate: Remove leading \ in SHA* checksums, and non-alphanumerics
    from extensions of SHA*E keys.

  * Include ssh in standalone tarball and OSX app.
  * watch: Avoid leaving hard links to files behind in .git/annex/tmp
    if a file is deleted or moved while it's being quarantined in preparation
    to being added to the annex.
  * Allow `git annex drop --from web`; of course this does not remove
    any file from the web, but it does make git-annex remove all urls
    associated with a file.
  * webapp: S3 and Glacier forms now have a select list of all
    currently-supported AWS regions.
  * webdav: Avoid trying to set props, avoiding incompatability with
    livedrive.com. Needs DAV version 0.3.
  * webapp: Prettify error display.
  * webapp: Fix bad interaction between required fields and modals.

    when preferred content settings want it.
  * drop --auto: Fix dropping content when there are no preferred content
    settings.
  * webapp: Allow user to specify the port when setting up a ssh or rsync
    remote.
  * assistant: Fix syncing to just created ssh remotes.
  * Enable WebDAV support in Debian package. Closes: #695532

  * Bugfix: directory special remote could loop forever storing a key 
    when a too small chunksize was configured.
  * Allow controlling whether login credentials for S3 and webdav are
    committed to the repository, by setting embedcreds=yes|no when running
    initremote.
  * Added smallarchive repository group, that only archives files that are
    in archive directories. Used by default for glacier when set up in the
    webapp.
  * assistant: Fixed handling of toplevel archive directory and
    client repository group.
  * assistant: Apply preferred content settings when a new symlink
    is created, or a symlink gets renamed. Made archive directories work.

  * bup: Don't pass - to bup-split to make it read stdin; bup 0.25
    does not accept that.
  * bugfix: Don't fail transferring content from read-only repos.
    Closes: #691341
  * configure: Check that checksum programs produce correct checksums.
  * Re-enable dbus, using a new version of the library that fixes the memory
    leak.
  * NetWatcher: When dbus connection is lost, try to reconnect.
  * Use USER and HOME environment when set, and only fall back to getpwent,
    which doesn't work with LDAP or NIS.
  * rsync special remote: Include annex-rsync-options when running rsync

  * webapp: Better behavior when pausing syncing to a remote when a transfer
    scan is running and queueing new transfers for that remote.
  * The standalone binaries are now built to not use ssh connection caching,
    in order to work with old versions of ssh.
  * A relative core.worktree is relative to the gitdir. Now that this is
    handled correctly, git-annex can be used in git submodules.
  * Temporarily disable use of dbus, as the haskell dbus library blows up
    when losing connection, which will need to be fixed upstream.

  * webapp: An interface for managing and configuring the assistant.
  * The default backend used when adding files to the annex is changed
    from SHA256 to SHA256E, to simplify interoperability with OSX, media
    players, and various programs that needlessly look at symlink targets.
    To get old behavior, add a .gitattributes containing: * annex.backend=SHA256
  * init: If no description is provided for a new repository, one will
    automatically be generated, like "joey@gnu:~/foo"
  * test: Set a lot of git environment variables so testing works in strange
    environments that normally need git config to set names, etc.
    Closes: #682351 Thanks, gregor herrmann
  * Disable ssh connection caching if the path to the control socket would be
    too long (and use relative path to minimise path to the control socket).
  * migrate: Check content before generating the new key, to avoid generating
    a key for corrupt data.
  * Support repositories created with --separate-git-dir. Closes: #684405
  * reinject: When the provided file doesn't match, leave it where it is,
    rather than moving to .git/annex/bad/
  * Avoid crashing on encoding errors in filenames when writing transfer info
    files and reading from checksum commands.
  * sync: Pushes the git-annex branch to remote/synced/git-annex, rather

  * Rsync special remotes can be configured with shellescape=no
    to avoid shell quoting that is normally done when using rsync over ssh.
    This is known to be needed for certian rsync hosting providers
    (specificially hidrive.strato.com) that use rsync over ssh but do not
    pass it through the shell.
  * dropunused: Allow specifying ranges to drop.
  * addunused: New command, the opposite of dropunused, it relinks unused
    content into the git repository.
  * Fix use of several config settings: annex.ssh-options,
    annex.rsync-options, annex.bup-split-options. (And adjust types to avoid
    the bugs that broke several config settings.)

    (Requested by the Internet Archive)
  * uninit: Clear annex.uuid from .git/config. Closes: #670639
  * Added shared cipher mode to encryptable special remotes. This option

  * git-annex (but not git-annex-shell) supports the git help.autocorrect
    configuration setting, doing fuzzy matching using the restricted

  * fsck: Fix up any broken links and misplaced content caused by the
    directory hash calculation bug fixed in the last release.
  * sync: Sync to lower cost remotes first.
  * status: Fixed to run in constant space.
  * status: More accurate display of sizes of tmp and bad keys.
  * unused: Now uses a bloom filter, and runs in constant space.
    Use of a bloom filter does mean it will not notice a small
    number of unused keys. For repos with up to half a million keys,
    it will miss one key in 1000.
  * Added annex.bloomcapacity and annex.bloomaccuracy, which can be
    adjusted as desired to tune the bloom filter.
  * status: Display amount of memory used by bloom filter, and
    detect when it's too small for the number of keys in a repository.
  * git-annex-shell: Runs hooks/annex-content after content is received
    or dropped.
  * Work around a bug in rsync (IMHO) introduced by openSUSE's SIP patch.
  * git-annex now behaves as git-annex-shell if symlinked to and run by that
    name. The Makefile sets this up, saving some 8 mb of installed size.
  * git-union-merge is a demo program, so it is no longer built by default.

    using a remote: remote.name.annex-start-command and
    remote.name.annex-stop-command

git-annex (3.20120227) unstable; urgency=low

  * Modifications to support ghc 7.4's handling of filenames.
    This version can only be built with ghc 7.4 or newer. See the ghc7.0
    branch for older ghcs.
  * S3: Fix irrefutable pattern failure when accessing encrypted S3
    credentials.
  * Use the haskell IfElse library.
  * Fix teardown of stale cached ssh connections.
  * Fixed to use the strict state monad, to avoid leaking all kinds of memory
    due to lazy state update thunks when adding/fixing many files.
  * Fixed some memory leaks that occurred when committing journal files.
  * Added a annex.queuesize setting, useful when adding hundreds of thousands
    of files on a system with plenty of memory.
  * whereis: Prints the urls of files that the web special remote knows about.
  * addurl --fast: Verifies that the url can be downloaded (only getting
    its head), and records the size in the key.
  * When checking that an url has a key, verify that the Content-Length,
    if available, matches the size of the key.
  * addurl: Added a --file option, which can be used to specify what
    file the url is added to. This can be used to override the default
    filename that is used when adding an url, which is based on the url.
    Or, when the file already exists, the url is recorded as another
    location of the file.
  * addurl: Normalize badly encoded urls.
  * addurl: Add --pathdepth option.
  * rekey: New plumbing level command, can be used to change the keys used
    for files en masse.
  * Store web special remote url info in a more efficient location.
    (Urls stored with this version will not be visible to older versions.)
  * Deal with NFS problem that caused a failure to remove a directory
    when removing content from the annex.
  * Make a single location log commit after a remote has received or
    dropped files. Uses a new "git-annex-shell commit" command when available.
  * To avoid commits of data to the git-annex branch after each command
    is run, set annex.alwayscommit=false. Its data will then be committed
    less frequently, when a merge or sync is done.
  * configure: Check if ssh connection caching is supported by the installed
    version of ssh and default annex.sshcaching accordingly.
  * move --from, copy --from: Now 10 times faster when scanning to find
    files in a remote on a local disk; rather than go through the location log
    to see which files are present on the remote, it simply looks at the 
    disk contents directly.

git-annex (3.20120123) unstable; urgency=low

  * fsck --from: Fscking a remote is now supported. It's done by retrieving
    the contents of the specified files from the remote, and checking them,
    so can be an expensive operation. Still, if the remote is a special
    remote, or a git repository that you cannot run fsck in locally, it's
    nice to have the ability to fsck it.
  * If you have any directory special remotes, now would be a good time to
    fsck them, in case you were hit by the data loss bug fixed in the
    previous release!
  * fsck --from remote --fast: Avoids expensive file transfers, at the
    expense of not checking file size and/or contents.
  * Ssh connection caching is now enabled automatically by git-annex.
    Only one ssh connection is made to each host per git-annex run, which
    can speed some things up a lot, as well as avoiding repeated password
    prompts. Concurrent git-annex processes also share ssh connections.
    Cached ssh connections are shut down when git-annex exits.
  * To disable the ssh caching (if for example you have your own broader
    ssh caching configuration), set annex.sshcaching=false.

    suitable for use here are the same).
  * Dotfiles, and files inside dotdirs are not added by "git annex add"
    unless the dotfile or directory is explicitly listed. So "git annex add ."
    will add all untracked files in the current directory except for those in
    dotdirs.
  * Added quickcheck to build dependencies, and fail if test suite cannot be
    built.
  * fsck: Do backend-specific check before checking numcopies is satisfied.

git-annex (3.20111231) unstable; urgency=low

  * sync: Improved to work well without a central bare repository.
    Thanks to Joachim Breitner.
  * Rather than manually committing, pushing, pulling, merging, and git annex
    merging, we encourage you to give "git annex sync" a try.
  * sync --fast: Selects some of the remotes with the lowest annex.cost
    and syncs those, in addition to any specified at the command line.
  * Union merge now finds the least expensive way to represent the merge.
  * reinject: Add a sanity check for using an annexed file as the source file.
  * Properly handle multiline git config values.
  * Fix the hook special remote, which bitrotted a while ago.
  * map: --fast disables use of dot to display map
  * Test suite improvements. Current top-level test coverage: 75%
  * Improve deletion of files from rsync special remotes. Closes: #652849
  * Add --include, which is the same as --not --exclude.
  * Format strings can be specified using the new --format option, to control
    what is output by git annex find.
  * Support git annex find --json
  * Fixed behavior when multiple insteadOf configs are provided for the
    same url base.
  * Can now be built with older git versions (before 1.7.7); the resulting
    binary should only be used with old git.
  * Updated to build with monad-control 0.3.

  * Ensure that git-annex branch changes are merged into git-annex's index,
    which fixes a bug that could cause changes that were pushed to the
    git-annex branch to get reverted. As a side effect, it's now safe
    for users to check out and commit changes directly to the git-annex
    branch.
  * map: Fix a failure to detect a loop when both repositories are local
    and refer to each other with relative paths.
  * Prevent key names from containing newlines.
  * add: If interrupted, add can leave files converted to symlinks but not
    yet added to git. Running the add again will now clean up this situtation.
  * Fix caching of decrypted ciphers, which failed when drop had to check
    multiple different encrypted special remotes.
  * unannex: Can be run on files that have been added to the annex, but not
    yet committed.
  * sync: New command that synchronises the local repository and default
    remote, by running git commit, pull, and push for you.
  * Version monad-control dependency in cabal file.

  * The VFAT filesystem on recent versions of Linux, when mounted with
    shortname=mixed, does not get along well with git-annex's mixed case
    .git/annex/objects hash directories. To avoid this problem, new content
    is now stored in all-lowercase hash directories. Except for non-bare
    repositories which would be a pain to transition and cannot be put on FAT.
    (Old mixed-case hash directories are still tried for backwards
    compatibility.)
  * Flush json output, avoiding a buffering problem that could result in
    doubled output.
  * Avoid needing haskell98 and other fixes for new ghc. Thanks, Mark Wright.
  * Bugfix: dropunused did not drop keys with two spaces in their name.
  * Support for storing .git/annex on a different device than the rest of the
    git repository.
  * --inbackend can be used to make git-annex only operate on files

  * init: When run in an already initalized repository, and without
    a description specified, don't delete the old description. 
  * Optimised union merging; now only runs git cat-file once, and runs

  * The default backend used when adding files to the annex is changed
    from WORM to SHA256.
    To get old behavior, add a .gitattributes containing: * annex.backend=WORM
  * Sped up some operations on remotes that are on the same host.
  * copy --to: Fixed leak when copying many files to a remote on the same
    host.
  * uninit: Add guard against being run with the git-annex branch checked out.
  * Fail if --from or --to is passed to commands that do not support them.
  * drop --from is now supported to remove file content from a remote.
  * status: Now always shows the current repository, even when it does not
    appear in uuid.log.
  * fsck: Now works in bare repositories. Checks location log information,
    and file contents. Does not check that numcopies is satisfied, as
    .gitattributes information about numcopies is not available in a bare
    repository.
  * unused, dropunused: Now work in bare repositories.
  * Removed the setkey command, and added a reinject command with a more
    useful interface.
  * The fromkey command now takes the key as its first parameter. The --key
    option is no longer used.
  * Built without any filename containing .git being excluded. Closes: #647215
  * Record uuid when auto-initializing a remote so it shows in status.

  * This version of git-annex only works with git 1.7.7 and newer.
    The breakage with old versions is subtle, and affects the
    annex.numcopies settings in .gitattributes, so be sure to upgrade git
    to 1.7.7. (Debian package now depends on that version.)
  * Don't pass absolute paths to git show-attr, as it started following
    symlinks when that's done in 1.7.7. Instead, use relative paths,
    which show-attr only handles 100% correctly in 1.7.7. Closes: #645046
  * Fix referring to remotes by uuid.
  * New or changed repository descriptions in uuid.log now have a timestamp,
    which is used to ensure the newest description is used when the uuid.log
    has been merged.
  * Note that older versions of git-annex will display the timestamp as part
    of the repository description, which is ugly but otherwise harmless.
  * Add timestamps to trust.log and remote.log too.
  * git-annex-shell: Added the --uuid option.
  * git-annex now asks git-annex-shell to verify that it's operating in 
    the expected repository.
  * Note that this git-annex will not interoperate with remotes using 
    older versions of git-annex-shell.
  * Now supports git's insteadOf configuration, to modify the url
    used to access a remote. Note that pushInsteadOf is not used;
    that and pushurl are reserved for actual git pushes. Closes: #644278
  * status: List all known repositories.
  * When displaying a list of repositories, show git remote names

    Example: git annex get --exclude '*.mp3' --and --not -( --in usbdrive --or --in archive -)
  * --copies=N can be used to make git-annex only operate on files with
    the specified number of copies. (And --not --copies=N for the inverse.)
  * find: Rather than only showing files whose contents are present,
    when used with --exclude --copies or --in, displays all files that
    match the specified conditions.
  * Note that this is a behavior change for git-annex find! Old behavior
    can be gotten by using: git-annex find --in .
  * status: Massively sped up; remove --fast mode.
  * unused: File contents used by branches and tags are no longer

  * Set EMAIL when running test suite so that git does not need to be
    configured first. Closes: #638998
  * The wget command will now be used in preference to curl, if available.
  * init: Make description an optional parameter.
  * unused, status: Sped up by avoiding unnecessary stats of annexed files.
  * unused --remote: Reduced memory use to 1/4th what was used before.
  * Add --json switch, to produce machine-consumable output.

git-annex (3.20110819) unstable; urgency=low

  * Now "git annex init" only has to be run once, when a git repository
    is first being created. Clones will automatically notice that git-annex
    is in use and automatically perform a basic initalization. It's
    still recommended to run "git annex init" in any clones, to describe them.
  * Added annex-cost-command configuration, which can be used to vary the
    cost of a remote based on the output of a shell command.
  * Fix broken upgrade from V1 repository. Closes: #638584

  * Fix sign bug in disk free space checking.
  * Bugfix: Forgot to de-escape keys when upgrading. Could result in
    bad location log data for keys that contain [&:%] in their names.
    (A workaround for this problem is to run git annex fsck.)
  * add: Avoid a failure mode that resulted in the file seemingly being
    deleted (content put in the annex but no symlink present).

git-annex (3.20110705) unstable; urgency=low

  * uninit: Delete the git-annex branch and .git/annex/
  * unannex: In --fast mode, file content is left in the annex, and a
    hard link made to it.
  * uninit: Use unannex in --fast mode, to support unannexing multiple
    files that link to the same content.
  * Drop the dependency on the haskell curl bindings, use regular haskell HTTP.
  * Fix a pipeline stall when upgrading (caused by #624389).

git-annex (3.20110702) unstable; urgency=low

  * Now the web can be used as a special remote. 
    This feature replaces the old URL backend.
  * addurl: New command to download an url and store it in the annex.
  * Sped back up fsck, copy --from, and other commands that often
    have to read a lot of information from the git-annex branch. Such
    commands are now faster than they were before introduction of the
    git-annex branch.
  * Always ensure git-annex branch exists.
  * Modify location log parser to allow future expansion.
  * --force will cause add, etc, to operate on ignored files.
  * Avoid mangling encoding when storing the description of repository
    and other content.
  * cabal can now be used to build git-annex. This is substantially
    slower than using make, does not build or install documentation,
    does not run the test suite, and is not particularly recommended,
    but could be useful to some.

  * New repository format, annex.version=3. Use `git annex upgrade` to migrate.
  * git-annex now stores its logs in a git-annex branch.
  * merge: New subcommand. Auto-merges the new git-annex branch.
  * Improved handling of bare git repos with annexes. Many more commands will
    work in them.
  * git-annex is now more robust; it will never leave state files
    uncommitted when some other git process comes along and locks the index
    at an inconvenient time.
  * rsync is now used when copying files from repos on other filesystems.
    cp is still used when copying file from repos on the same filesystem,
    since --reflink=auto can make it significantly faster on filesystems
    such as btrfs.
  * Allow --trust etc to specify a repository by name, for temporarily 
    trusting repositories that are not configured remotes.
  * unlock: Made atomic.
  * git-union-merge: New git subcommand, that does a generic union merge
    operation, and operates efficiently without touching the working tree.

git-annex (0.20110516) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add a few tweaks to make it easy to use the Internet Archive's variant
    of S3. In particular, munge key filenames to comply with the IA's filename
    limits, disable encryption, support their nonstandard way of creating
    buckets, and allow x-archive-* headers to be specified in initremote to
    set item metadata.
  * Added filename extension preserving variant backends SHA1E, SHA256E, etc.
  * migrate: Use current filename when generating new key, for backends
    where the filename affects the key name.
  * Work around a bug in Network.URI's handling of bracketed ipv6 addresses.

  * Add hook special remotes.
  * Avoid crashing when an existing key is readded to the annex.
  * unused: Now also lists files fsck places in .git/annex/bad/
  * S3: When encryption is enabled, the Amazon S3 login credentials
    are stored, encrypted, in .git-annex/remotes.log, so environment
    variables need not be set after the remote is initialized.

git-annex (0.20110427) unstable; urgency=low

  * Switch back to haskell SHA library, so git-annex remains buildable on
    Debian stable.
  * Added rsync special remotes. This could be used, for example, to 
    store annexed content on rsync.net (encrypted naturally). Or anywhere else.
  * Bugfix: Avoid pipeline stall when running git annex drop or fsck on a
    lot of files. Possibly only occured with ghc 7.

  * bup is now supported as a special type of remote.
  * The data sent to special remotes (Amazon S3, bup, etc) can be encrypted
    using GPG for privacy.
  * Use lowercase hash directories for locationlog files, to avoid
    some issues with git on OSX with the mixed-case directories.
    No migration is needed; the old mixed case hash directories are still
    read; new information is written to the new directories.
  * Unused files on remotes, particulary special remotes, can now be
    identified and dropped, by using "--from remote" with git annex unused
    and git annex dropunused.
  * Clear up short option confusion between --from and --force (-f is now
    --from, and there is no short option for --force).
  * Add build depend on perlmagick so docs are consistently built.
    Closes: #621410
  * Add doc-base file. Closes: #621408
  * Periodically flush git command queue, to avoid boating memory usage

    Warning: Encrypting data before sending it to S3 is not yet supported.
  * Note that Amazon S3 support is not built in by default on Debian yet,
    as hS3 is not packaged.
  * fsck: Ensure that files and directories in .git/annex/objects

  * annex.diskreserve can be given in arbitrary units (ie "0.5 gigabytes")
  * Generalized remotes handling, laying groundwork for remotes that are
    not regular git remotes. (Think Amazon S3.)
  * Provide a less expensive version of `git annex copy --to`, enabled
    via --fast. This assumes that location tracking information is correct,
    rather than contacting the remote for every file.
  * Bugfix: Keys could be received into v1 annexes from v2 annexes, via
    v1 git-annex-shell. This results in some oddly named keys in the v1
    annex. Recognise and fix those keys when upgrading, instead of crashing.

git-annex (0.20110325) experimental; urgency=low

  * Free space checking is now done, for transfers of data for keys
    that have free space metadata. (Notably, not for SHA* keys generated
    with git-annex 0.2x or earlier.) The code is believed to work on
    Linux, FreeBSD, and OSX; check compile-time messages to see if it
    is not enabled for your OS.
  * Add annex.diskreserve config setting, to control how much free space
    to reserve for other purposes and avoid using (defaults to 1 mb).
  * Add --fast flag, that can enable less expensive, but also less thorough
    versions of some commands.
  * fsck: In fast mode, avoid checking checksums.
  * unused: In fast mode, just show all existing temp files as unused,
    and avoid expensive scan for other unused content.
  * migrate: Support migrating v1 SHA keys to v2 SHA keys with
    size information that can be used for free space checking.
  * Fix space leak in fsck and drop commands.
  * migrate: Bugfix for case when migrating a file results in a key that
    is already present in .git/annex/objects.
  * dropunused: Significantly sped up; only read unused log file once.

  * Fix support for remotes with '.' in their names.
  * Add version command to show git-annex version as well as repository

  * No longer auto-upgrade to repository format 2, to avoid accidental
    upgrades, etc. Use git-annex upgrade when you're ready to run this
    version.

git-annex (0.20110316) experimental; urgency=low

  * New repository format, annex.version=2.
  * The first time git-annex is run in an old format repository, it
    will automatically upgrade it to the new format, staging all
    necessary changes to git. Also added a "git annex upgrade" command.
  * Colons are now avoided in filenames, so bare clones of git repos
    can be put on USB thumb drives formatted with vFAT or similar
    filesystems.
  * Added two levels of hashing to object directory and .git-annex logs,
    to improve scalability with enormous numbers of annexed
    objects. (With one hundred million annexed objects, each
    directory would contain fewer than 1024 files.)
  * The setkey, fromkey, and dropkey subcommands have changed how
    the key is specified. --backend is no longer used with these.

  Branched the 0.24 series, which will be maintained for a while to
  support v1 git-annex repos, while main development moves to the 0.2011

  * Add Suggests on graphviz. Closes: #618039
  * When adding files to the annex, the symlinks pointing at the annexed
    content are made to have the same mtime as the original file.
    While git does not preserve that information, this allows a tool
    like metastore to be used with annexed files.
    (Currently this is only done on systems supporting POSIX 200809.)

git-annex (0.23) unstable; urgency=low

  * Support ssh remotes with a port specified.
  * whereis: New subcommand to show where a file's content has gotten to.
  * Rethink filename encoding handling for display. Since filename encoding
    may or may not match locale settings, any attempt to decode filenames 
    will fail for some files. So instead, do all output in binary mode.

git-annex (0.22) unstable; urgency=low

  * Git annexes can now be attached to bare git repositories.
    (Both the local and remote host must have this version of git-annex
    installed for it to work.)
  * Support filenames that start with a dash; when such a file is passed
    to a utility it will be escaped to avoid it being interpreted as an
    option. (I went a little overboard and got the type checker involved
    in this, so such files are rather comprehensively supported now.)
  * New backends: SHA512 SHA384 SHA256 SHA224
    (Supported on systems where corresponding shaNsum commands are available.)
  * describe: New subcommand that can set or change the description of
    a repository.
  * Fix test suite to reap zombies.
    (Zombies can be particularly annoying on OSX; thanks to Jimmy Tang
    for his help eliminating the infestation... for now.)
  * Make test suite not rely on a working cp -pr.
    (The Unix wars are still ON!)
  * Look for dir.git directories the same as git does.
  * Support remote urls specified as relative paths.
  * Support non-ssh remote paths that contain tilde expansions.
  * fsck: Check for and repair location log damage.
  * Bugfix: When fsck detected and moved away corrupt file content, it did
    not update the location log.

  * Preserve specified file ordering when instructed to act on multiple
    files or directories. For example, "git annex get a b" will now always
    get "a" before "b". Previously it could operate in either order.
  * unannex: Commit staged changes at end, to avoid some confusing behavior
    with the pre-commit hook, which would see some types of commits after
    an unannex as checking in of an unlocked file.
  * map: New subcommand that uses graphviz to display a nice map of
    the git repository network.
  * Deal with the mtl/monads-fd conflict.

  * untrust: Now marks the current repository as untrusted.
  * semitrust: Now restores the default trust level. (What untrust used to do.)
  * fsck, drop: Take untrusted repositories into account.
  * Bugfix: Files were copied from trusted remotes first even if their
    annex.cost was higher than other remotes.
  * Improved temp file handling. Transfers of content can now be resumed
    from temp files later; the resume does not have to be the immediate
    next git-annex run.
  * unused: Include partially transferred content in the list.
  * Bugfix: Running a second git-annex while a first has a transfer in

git-annex (0.16) unstable; urgency=low

  * git-annex-shell: Avoid exposing any git repo config except for the
    annex.uuid when doing configlist.
  * bugfix: Running `move --to` with a remote whose UUID was not yet known
    could result in git-annex not recording on the local side where the
    file was moved to. This could not result in data loss, or even a
    significant problem, since the remote *did* record that it had the file.
  * Also, add a general guard to detect attempts to record information
    about repositories with missing UUIDs.
  * bugfix: Running `move --to` with a non-ssh remote failed.
  * bugfix: Running `copy --to` with a non-ssh remote actually did a move.
  * Many test suite improvements. Current top-level test coverage: 65%

  * Fix bug in numcopies handling when multiple remotes pointed to the
    same repository.
  * Introduce the git-annex-shell command. It's now possible to make
    a user have it as a restricted login shell, similar to git-shell.
  * Note that git-annex will always use git-annex-shell when accessing
    a ssh remote, so all of your remotes need to be upgraded to this
    version of git-annex at the same time.
  * Now rsync is exclusively used for copying files to and from remotes.

    much faster on filesystems like btrfs that support copy on write.

git-annex (0.07) unstable; urgency=low

  * find: New subcommand.
  * unused: New subcommand, finds unused data. (Split out from fsck.)
  * dropunused: New subcommand, provides for easy dropping of unused keys
    by number, as listed by the unused subcommand.
  * fsck: Print warnings to stderr; --quiet can now be used to only see
    problems.

git-annex (0.06) unstable; urgency=low

  * fsck: Check if annex.numcopies is satisfied.
  * fsck: Verify the sha1 of files when the SHA1 backend is used.
  * fsck: Verify the size of files when the WORM backend is used.
  * fsck: Allow specifying individual files if fscking everything
    is not desired.
  * fsck: Fix bug, introduced in 0.04, in detection of unused data.

git-annex (0.05) unstable; urgency=low

  * Optimize both pre-commit and lock subcommands to not call git diff
    on every file being committed/locked.
    (This actually also works around a bug in ghc, that caused
    git-annex 0.04 pre-commit to sometimes corrupt filename being read
    from git ls-files and fail. 
    See <http://hackage.haskell.org/trac/ghc/ticket/4493>
    The excessive number of calls made by pre-commit exposed the ghc bug.
    Thanks Josh Triplett for the debugging.)
  * Build with -O2.

git-annex (0.04) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add unlock subcommand, which replaces the symlink with a copy of
    the file's content in preparation of changing it. The "edit" subcommand
    is an alias for unlock.
  * Add lock subcommand.
  * Unlocked files will now automatically be added back into the annex when
    committed (and the updated symlink committed), by some magic in the
    pre-commit hook.
  * The SHA1 backend is now fully usable.
  * Add annex.version, which will be used to automate upgrades
    between incompatible versions.
  * Reorganised the layout of .git/annex/
  * The new layout will be automatically upgraded to the first time
    git-annex is used in a repository with the old layout.
  * Note that git-annex 0.04 cannot transfer content from old repositories
    that have not yet been upgraded.
  * Annexed file contents are now made unwritable and put in unwriteable
    directories, to avoid them accidentially being removed or modified.
    (Thanks Josh Triplett for the idea.)
  * Add build dep on libghc6-testpack-dev. Closes: #603016
  * Avoid using runghc to run test suite as it is not available on all
    architectures. Closes: #603006

git-annex (0.03) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix support for file:// remotes.
  * Add --verbose
  * Fix SIGINT handling.
  * Fix handling of files with unusual characters in their name.
  * Fixed memory leak; git-annex no longer reads the whole file list
    from git before starting, and will be much faster with large repos.
  * Fix crash on unknown symlinks.
  * Added remote.annex-scp-options and remote.annex-ssh-options.
  * The backends to use when adding different sets of files can be configured
    via gitattributes.
  * In .gitattributes, the git-annex-backend attribute can be set to the
    names of backends to use when adding different types of files.
  * Add fsck subcommand. (For now it only finds unused key contents in the
    annex.)

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Sun, 07 Nov 2010 18:26:04 -0400

git-annex (0.02) unstable; urgency=low

  * Can scp annexed files from remote hosts, and check remote hosts for
    file content when dropping files.
  * New move subcommand, that makes it easy to move file contents from
    or to a remote.
  * New fromkey subcommand, for registering urls, etc.
  * git-annex init will now set up a pre-commit hook that fixes up symlinks
    before they are committed, to ensure that moving symlinks around does not
    break them.
  * More intelligent and fast staging of modified files; git add coalescing.
  * Add remote.annex-ignore git config setting to allow completly disabling
    a given remote.
  * --from/--to can be used to control the remote repository that git-annex
    uses.
  * --quiet can be used to avoid verbose output
  * New plumbing-level dropkey and addkey subcommands.
  * Lots of bug fixes.

git-annex (0.01) unstable; urgency=low
